PERSUASION

CHAPTER 1


SIR WALTER ELLIOT, OF KELLYNCH HALL, IN SOMERSETSHIRE, WAS A MAN WHO,
FOR HIS OWN AMUSEMENT, NEVER TOOK UP ANY BOOK BUT THE BARONETAGE; THERE
HE FOUND OCCUPATION FOR AN IDLE HOUR, AND CONSOLATION IN A DISTRESSED
ONE; THERE HIS FACULTIES WERE ROUSED INTO ADMIRATION AND RESPECT, BY
CONTEMPLATING THE LIMITED REMNANT OF THE EARLIEST PATENTS; THERE ANY
UNWELCOME SENSATIONS, ARISING FROM DOMESTIC AFFAIRS CHANGED NATURALLY
INTO PITY AND CONTEMPT AS HE TURNED OVER THE ALMOST ENDLESS CREATIONS
OF THE LAST CENTURY; AND THERE, IF EVERY OTHER LEAF WERE POWERLESS, HE
COULD READ HIS OWN HISTORY WITH AN INTEREST WHICH NEVER FAILED.  THIS
WAS THE PAGE AT WHICH THE FAVOURITE VOLUME ALWAYS OPENED:

           "ELLIOT OF KELLYNCH HALL.

"WALTER ELLIOT, BORN MARCH 1, 1760, MARRIED, JULY 15, 1784, ELIZABETH,
DAUGHTER OF JAMES STEVENSON, ESQ. OF SOUTH PARK, IN THE COUNTY OF
GLOUCESTER, BY WHICH LADY (WHO DIED 1800) HE HAS ISSUE ELIZABETH, BORN
JUNE 1, 1785; ANNE, BORN AUGUST 9, 1787; A STILL-BORN SON, NOVEMBER 5,
1789; MARY, BORN NOVEMBER 20, 1791."

PRECISELY SUCH HAD THE PARAGRAPH ORIGINALLY STOOD FROM THE PRINTER'S
HANDS; BUT SIR WALTER HAD IMPROVED IT BY ADDING, FOR THE INFORMATION OF
HIMSELF AND HIS FAMILY, THESE WORDS, AFTER THE DATE OF MARY'S BIRTH--
"MARRIED, DECEMBER 16, 1810, CHARLES, SON AND HEIR OF CHARLES MUSGROVE,
ESQ. OF UPPERCROSS, IN THE COUNTY OF SOMERSET," AND BY INSERTING MOST
ACCURATELY THE DAY OF THE MONTH ON WHICH HE HAD LOST HIS WIFE.

THEN FOLLOWED THE HISTORY AND RISE OF THE ANCIENT AND RESPECTABLE
FAMILY, IN THE USUAL TERMS; HOW IT HAD BEEN FIRST SETTLED IN CHESHIRE;
HOW MENTIONED IN DUGDALE, SERVING THE OFFICE OF HIGH SHERIFF,
REPRESENTING A BOROUGH IN THREE SUCCESSIVE PARLIAMENTS, EXERTIONS OF
LOYALTY, AND DIGNITY OF BARONET, IN THE FIRST YEAR OF CHARLES II, WITH
ALL THE MARYS AND ELIZABETHS THEY HAD MARRIED; FORMING ALTOGETHER TWO
HANDSOME DUODECIMO PAGES, AND CONCLUDING WITH THE ARMS AND
MOTTO:--"PRINCIPAL SEAT, KELLYNCH HALL, IN THE COUNTY OF SOMERSET," AND
SIR WALTER'S HANDWRITING AGAIN IN THIS FINALE:--

"HEIR PRESUMPTIVE, WILLIAM WALTER ELLIOT, ESQ., GREAT GRANDSON OF THE
SECOND SIR WALTER."

VANITY WAS THE BEGINNING AND THE END OF SIR WALTER ELLIOT'S CHARACTER;
VANITY OF PERSON AND OF SITUATION.  HE HAD BEEN REMARKABLY HANDSOME IN
HIS YOUTH; AND, AT FIFTY-FOUR, WAS STILL A VERY FINE MAN.  FEW WOMEN
COULD THINK MORE OF THEIR PERSONAL APPEARANCE THAN HE DID, NOR COULD
THE VALET OF ANY NEW MADE LORD BE MORE DELIGHTED WITH THE PLACE HE HELD
IN SOCIETY.  HE CONSIDERED THE BLESSING OF BEAUTY AS INFERIOR ONLY TO
THE BLESSING OF A BARONETCY; AND THE SIR WALTER ELLIOT, WHO UNITED
THESE GIFTS, WAS THE CONSTANT OBJECT OF HIS WARMEST RESPECT AND
DEVOTION.

HIS GOOD LOOKS AND HIS RANK HAD ONE FAIR CLAIM ON HIS ATTACHMENT; SINCE
TO THEM HE MUST HAVE OWED A WIFE OF VERY SUPERIOR CHARACTER TO ANY
THING DESERVED BY HIS OWN.  LADY ELLIOT HAD BEEN AN EXCELLENT WOMAN,
SENSIBLE AND AMIABLE; WHOSE JUDGEMENT AND CONDUCT, IF THEY MIGHT BE
PARDONED THE YOUTHFUL INFATUATION WHICH MADE HER LADY ELLIOT, HAD NEVER
REQUIRED INDULGENCE AFTERWARDS.--SHE HAD HUMOURED, OR SOFTENED, OR
CONCEALED HIS FAILINGS, AND PROMOTED HIS REAL RESPECTABILITY FOR
SEVENTEEN YEARS; AND THOUGH NOT THE VERY HAPPIEST BEING IN THE WORLD
HERSELF, HAD FOUND ENOUGH IN HER DUTIES, HER FRIENDS, AND HER CHILDREN,
TO ATTACH HER TO LIFE, AND MAKE IT NO MATTER OF INDIFFERENCE TO HER
WHEN SHE WAS CALLED ON TO QUIT THEM.--THREE GIRLS, THE TWO ELDEST
SIXTEEN AND FOURTEEN, WAS AN AWFUL LEGACY FOR A MOTHER TO BEQUEATH, AN
AWFUL CHARGE RATHER, TO CONFIDE TO THE AUTHORITY AND GUIDANCE OF A
CONCEITED, SILLY FATHER.  SHE HAD, HOWEVER, ONE VERY INTIMATE FRIEND, A
SENSIBLE, DESERVING WOMAN, WHO HAD BEEN BROUGHT, BY STRONG ATTACHMENT
TO HERSELF, TO SETTLE CLOSE BY HER, IN THE VILLAGE OF KELLYNCH; AND ON
HER KINDNESS AND ADVICE, LADY ELLIOT MAINLY RELIED FOR THE BEST HELP
AND MAINTENANCE OF THE GOOD PRINCIPLES AND INSTRUCTION WHICH SHE HAD
BEEN ANXIOUSLY GIVING HER DAUGHTERS.

THIS FRIEND, AND SIR WALTER, DID NOT MARRY, WHATEVER MIGHT HAVE BEEN
ANTICIPATED ON THAT HEAD BY THEIR ACQUAINTANCE.  THIRTEEN YEARS HAD
PASSED AWAY SINCE LADY ELLIOT'S DEATH, AND THEY WERE STILL NEAR
NEIGHBOURS AND INTIMATE FRIENDS, AND ONE REMAINED A WIDOWER, THE OTHER
A WIDOW.

THAT LADY RUSSELL, OF STEADY AGE AND CHARACTER, AND EXTREMELY WELL
PROVIDED FOR, SHOULD HAVE NO THOUGHT OF A SECOND MARRIAGE, NEEDS NO
APOLOGY TO THE PUBLIC, WHICH IS RATHER APT TO BE UNREASONABLY
DISCONTENTED WHEN A WOMAN DOES MARRY AGAIN, THAN WHEN SHE DOES NOT; BUT
SIR WALTER'S CONTINUING IN SINGLENESS REQUIRES EXPLANATION.  BE IT
KNOWN THEN, THAT SIR WALTER, LIKE A GOOD FATHER, (HAVING MET WITH ONE
OR TWO PRIVATE DISAPPOINTMENTS IN VERY UNREASONABLE APPLICATIONS),
PRIDED HIMSELF ON REMAINING SINGLE FOR HIS DEAR DAUGHTERS' SAKE.  FOR
ONE DAUGHTER, HIS ELDEST, HE WOULD REALLY HAVE GIVEN UP ANY THING,
WHICH HE HAD NOT BEEN VERY MUCH TEMPTED TO DO.  ELIZABETH HAD
SUCCEEDED, AT SIXTEEN, TO ALL THAT WAS POSSIBLE, OF HER MOTHER'S RIGHTS
AND CONSEQUENCE; AND BEING VERY HANDSOME, AND VERY LIKE HIMSELF, HER
INFLUENCE HAD ALWAYS BEEN GREAT, AND THEY HAD GONE ON TOGETHER MOST
HAPPILY.  HIS TWO OTHER CHILDREN WERE OF VERY INFERIOR VALUE.  MARY HAD
ACQUIRED A LITTLE ARTIFICIAL IMPORTANCE, BY BECOMING MRS CHARLES
MUSGROVE; BUT ANNE, WITH AN ELEGANCE OF MIND AND SWEETNESS OF
CHARACTER, WHICH MUST HAVE PLACED HER HIGH WITH ANY PEOPLE OF REAL
UNDERSTANDING, WAS NOBODY WITH EITHER FATHER OR SISTER; HER WORD HAD NO
WEIGHT, HER CONVENIENCE WAS ALWAYS TO GIVE WAY--SHE WAS ONLY ANNE.

TO LADY RUSSELL, INDEED, SHE WAS A MOST DEAR AND HIGHLY VALUED
GOD-DAUGHTER, FAVOURITE, AND FRIEND.  LADY RUSSELL LOVED THEM ALL; BUT
IT WAS ONLY IN ANNE THAT SHE COULD FANCY THE MOTHER TO REVIVE AGAIN.

A FEW YEARS BEFORE, ANNE ELLIOT HAD BEEN A VERY PRETTY GIRL, BUT HER
BLOOM HAD VANISHED EARLY; AND AS EVEN IN ITS HEIGHT, HER FATHER HAD
FOUND LITTLE TO ADMIRE IN HER, (SO TOTALLY DIFFERENT WERE HER DELICATE
FEATURES AND MILD DARK EYES FROM HIS OWN), THERE COULD BE NOTHING IN
THEM, NOW THAT SHE WAS FADED AND THIN, TO EXCITE HIS ESTEEM. HE HAD
NEVER INDULGED MUCH HOPE, HE HAD NOW NONE, OF EVER READING HER NAME IN
ANY OTHER PAGE OF HIS FAVOURITE WORK.  ALL EQUALITY OF ALLIANCE MUST
REST WITH ELIZABETH, FOR MARY HAD MERELY CONNECTED HERSELF WITH AN OLD
COUNTRY FAMILY OF RESPECTABILITY AND LARGE FORTUNE, AND HAD THEREFORE
GIVEN ALL THE HONOUR AND RECEIVED NONE: ELIZABETH WOULD, ONE DAY OR
OTHER, MARRY SUITABLY.

IT SOMETIMES HAPPENS THAT A WOMAN IS HANDSOMER AT TWENTY-NINE THAN SHE
WAS TEN YEARS BEFORE; AND, GENERALLY SPEAKING, IF THERE HAS BEEN
NEITHER ILL HEALTH NOR ANXIETY, IT IS A TIME OF LIFE AT WHICH SCARCELY
ANY CHARM IS LOST.  IT WAS SO WITH ELIZABETH, STILL THE SAME HANDSOME
MISS ELLIOT THAT SHE HAD BEGUN TO BE THIRTEEN YEARS AGO, AND SIR WALTER
MIGHT BE EXCUSED, THEREFORE, IN FORGETTING HER AGE, OR, AT LEAST, BE
DEEMED ONLY HALF A FOOL, FOR THINKING HIMSELF AND ELIZABETH AS BLOOMING
AS EVER, AMIDST THE WRECK OF THE GOOD LOOKS OF EVERYBODY ELSE; FOR HE
COULD PLAINLY SEE HOW OLD ALL THE REST OF HIS FAMILY AND ACQUAINTANCE
WERE GROWING.  ANNE HAGGARD, MARY COARSE, EVERY FACE IN THE
NEIGHBOURHOOD WORSTING, AND THE RAPID INCREASE OF THE CROW'S FOOT ABOUT
LADY RUSSELL'S TEMPLES HAD LONG BEEN A DISTRESS TO HIM.

ELIZABETH DID NOT QUITE EQUAL HER FATHER IN PERSONAL CONTENTMENT.
THIRTEEN YEARS HAD SEEN HER MISTRESS OF KELLYNCH HALL, PRESIDING AND
DIRECTING WITH A SELF-POSSESSION AND DECISION WHICH COULD NEVER HAVE
GIVEN THE IDEA OF HER BEING YOUNGER THAN SHE WAS.  FOR THIRTEEN YEARS
HAD SHE BEEN DOING THE HONOURS, AND LAYING DOWN THE DOMESTIC LAW AT
HOME, AND LEADING THE WAY TO THE CHAISE AND FOUR, AND WALKING
IMMEDIATELY AFTER LADY RUSSELL OUT OF ALL THE DRAWING-ROOMS AND
DINING-ROOMS IN THE COUNTRY.  THIRTEEN WINTERS' REVOLVING FROSTS HAD
SEEN HER OPENING EVERY BALL OF CREDIT WHICH A SCANTY NEIGHBOURHOOD
AFFORDED, AND THIRTEEN SPRINGS SHEWN THEIR BLOSSOMS, AS SHE TRAVELLED
UP TO LONDON WITH HER FATHER, FOR A FEW WEEKS' ANNUAL ENJOYMENT OF THE
GREAT WORLD.  SHE HAD THE REMEMBRANCE OF ALL THIS, SHE HAD THE
CONSCIOUSNESS OF BEING NINE-AND-TWENTY TO GIVE HER SOME REGRETS AND
SOME APPREHENSIONS; SHE WAS FULLY SATISFIED OF BEING STILL QUITE AS
HANDSOME AS EVER, BUT SHE FELT HER APPROACH TO THE YEARS OF DANGER, AND
WOULD HAVE REJOICED TO BE CERTAIN OF BEING PROPERLY SOLICITED BY
BARONET-BLOOD WITHIN THE NEXT TWELVEMONTH OR TWO.  THEN MIGHT SHE AGAIN
TAKE UP THE BOOK OF BOOKS WITH AS MUCH ENJOYMENT AS IN HER EARLY YOUTH,
BUT NOW SHE LIKED IT NOT.  ALWAYS TO BE PRESENTED WITH THE DATE OF HER
OWN BIRTH AND SEE NO MARRIAGE FOLLOW BUT THAT OF A YOUNGEST SISTER,
MADE THE BOOK AN EVIL; AND MORE THAN ONCE, WHEN HER FATHER HAD LEFT IT
OPEN ON THE TABLE NEAR HER, HAD SHE CLOSED IT, WITH AVERTED EYES, AND
PUSHED IT AWAY.

SHE HAD HAD A DISAPPOINTMENT, MOREOVER, WHICH THAT BOOK, AND ESPECIALLY
THE HISTORY OF HER OWN FAMILY, MUST EVER PRESENT THE REMEMBRANCE OF.
THE HEIR PRESUMPTIVE, THE VERY WILLIAM WALTER ELLIOT, ESQ., WHOSE
RIGHTS HAD BEEN SO GENEROUSLY SUPPORTED BY HER FATHER, HAD DISAPPOINTED
HER.

SHE HAD, WHILE A VERY YOUNG GIRL, AS SOON AS SHE HAD KNOWN HIM TO BE,
IN THE EVENT OF HER HAVING NO BROTHER, THE FUTURE BARONET, MEANT TO
MARRY HIM, AND HER FATHER HAD ALWAYS MEANT THAT SHE SHOULD.  HE HAD NOT
BEEN KNOWN TO THEM AS A BOY; BUT SOON AFTER LADY ELLIOT'S DEATH, SIR
WALTER HAD SOUGHT THE ACQUAINTANCE, AND THOUGH HIS OVERTURES HAD NOT
BEEN MET WITH ANY WARMTH, HE HAD PERSEVERED IN SEEKING IT, MAKING
ALLOWANCE FOR THE MODEST DRAWING-BACK OF YOUTH; AND, IN ONE OF THEIR
SPRING EXCURSIONS TO LONDON, WHEN ELIZABETH WAS IN HER FIRST BLOOM, MR
ELLIOT HAD BEEN FORCED INTO THE INTRODUCTION.

HE WAS AT THAT TIME A VERY YOUNG MAN, JUST ENGAGED IN THE STUDY OF THE
LAW; AND ELIZABETH FOUND HIM EXTREMELY AGREEABLE, AND EVERY PLAN IN HIS
FAVOUR WAS CONFIRMED.  HE WAS INVITED TO KELLYNCH HALL; HE WAS TALKED
OF AND EXPECTED ALL THE REST OF THE YEAR; BUT HE NEVER CAME.  THE
FOLLOWING SPRING HE WAS SEEN AGAIN IN TOWN, FOUND EQUALLY AGREEABLE,
AGAIN ENCOURAGED, INVITED, AND EXPECTED, AND AGAIN HE DID NOT COME; AND
THE NEXT TIDINGS WERE THAT HE WAS MARRIED.  INSTEAD OF PUSHING HIS
FORTUNE IN THE LINE MARKED OUT FOR THE HEIR OF THE HOUSE OF ELLIOT, HE
HAD PURCHASED INDEPENDENCE BY UNITING HIMSELF TO A RICH WOMAN OF
INFERIOR BIRTH.

SIR WALTER HAS RESENTED IT.  AS THE HEAD OF THE HOUSE, HE FELT THAT HE
OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN CONSULTED, ESPECIALLY AFTER TAKING THE YOUNG MAN SO
PUBLICLY BY THE HAND; "FOR THEY MUST HAVE BEEN SEEN TOGETHER," HE
OBSERVED, "ONCE AT TATTERSALL'S, AND TWICE IN THE LOBBY OF THE HOUSE OF
COMMONS."  HIS DISAPPROBATION WAS EXPRESSED, BUT APPARENTLY VERY LITTLE
REGARDED.  MR ELLIOT HAD ATTEMPTED NO APOLOGY, AND SHEWN HIMSELF AS
UNSOLICITOUS OF BEING LONGER NOTICED BY THE FAMILY, AS SIR WALTER
CONSIDERED HIM UNWORTHY OF IT:  ALL ACQUAINTANCE BETWEEN THEM HAD
CEASED.

THIS VERY AWKWARD HISTORY OF MR ELLIOT WAS STILL, AFTER AN INTERVAL OF
SEVERAL YEARS, FELT WITH ANGER BY ELIZABETH, WHO HAD LIKED THE MAN FOR
HIMSELF, AND STILL MORE FOR BEING HER FATHER'S HEIR, AND WHOSE STRONG
FAMILY PRIDE COULD SEE ONLY IN HIM A PROPER MATCH FOR SIR WALTER
ELLIOT'S ELDEST DAUGHTER.  THERE WAS NOT A BARONET FROM A TO Z WHOM HER
FEELINGS COULD HAVE SO WILLINGLY ACKNOWLEDGED AS AN EQUAL.  YET SO
MISERABLY HAD HE CONDUCTED HIMSELF, THAT THOUGH SHE WAS AT THIS PRESENT
TIME (THE SUMMER OF 1814) WEARING BLACK RIBBONS FOR HIS WIFE, SHE COULD
NOT ADMIT HIM TO BE WORTH THINKING OF AGAIN.  THE DISGRACE OF HIS FIRST
MARRIAGE MIGHT, PERHAPS, AS THERE WAS NO REASON TO SUPPOSE IT
PERPETUATED BY OFFSPRING, HAVE BEEN GOT OVER, HAD HE NOT DONE WORSE;
BUT HE HAD, AS BY THE ACCUSTOMARY INTERVENTION OF KIND FRIENDS, THEY
HAD BEEN INFORMED, SPOKEN MOST DISRESPECTFULLY OF THEM ALL, MOST
SLIGHTINGLY AND CONTEMPTUOUSLY OF THE VERY BLOOD HE BELONGED TO, AND
THE HONOURS WHICH WERE HEREAFTER TO BE HIS OWN.  THIS COULD NOT BE
PARDONED.

SUCH WERE ELIZABETH ELLIOT'S SENTIMENTS AND SENSATIONS; SUCH THE CARES
TO ALLOY, THE AGITATIONS TO VARY, THE SAMENESS AND THE ELEGANCE, THE
PROSPERITY AND THE NOTHINGNESS OF HER SCENE OF LIFE; SUCH THE FEELINGS
TO GIVE INTEREST TO A LONG, UNEVENTFUL RESIDENCE IN ONE COUNTRY CIRCLE,
TO FILL THE VACANCIES WHICH THERE WERE NO HABITS OF UTILITY ABROAD, NO
TALENTS OR ACCOMPLISHMENTS FOR HOME, TO OCCUPY.

BUT NOW, ANOTHER OCCUPATION AND SOLICITUDE OF MIND WAS BEGINNING TO BE
ADDED TO THESE.  HER FATHER WAS GROWING DISTRESSED FOR MONEY.  SHE
KNEW, THAT WHEN HE NOW TOOK UP THE BARONETAGE, IT WAS TO DRIVE THE
HEAVY BILLS OF HIS TRADESPEOPLE, AND THE UNWELCOME HINTS OF MR
SHEPHERD, HIS AGENT, FROM HIS THOUGHTS.  THE KELLYNCH PROPERTY WAS
GOOD, BUT NOT EQUAL TO SIR WALTER'S APPREHENSION OF THE STATE REQUIRED
IN ITS POSSESSOR.  WHILE LADY ELLIOT LIVED, THERE HAD BEEN METHOD,
MODERATION, AND ECONOMY, WHICH HAD JUST KEPT HIM WITHIN HIS INCOME; BUT
WITH HER HAD DIED ALL SUCH RIGHT-MINDEDNESS, AND FROM THAT PERIOD HE
HAD BEEN CONSTANTLY EXCEEDING IT.  IT HAD NOT BEEN POSSIBLE FOR HIM TO
SPEND LESS; HE HAD DONE NOTHING BUT WHAT SIR WALTER ELLIOT WAS
IMPERIOUSLY CALLED ON TO DO; BUT BLAMELESS AS HE WAS, HE WAS NOT ONLY
GROWING DREADFULLY IN DEBT, BUT WAS HEARING OF IT SO OFTEN, THAT IT
BECAME VAIN TO ATTEMPT CONCEALING IT LONGER, EVEN PARTIALLY, FROM HIS
DAUGHTER.  HE HAD GIVEN HER SOME HINTS OF IT THE LAST SPRING IN TOWN;
HE HAD GONE SO FAR EVEN AS TO SAY, "CAN WE RETRENCH?  DOES IT OCCUR TO
YOU THAT THERE IS ANY ONE ARTICLE IN WHICH WE CAN RETRENCH?" AND
ELIZABETH, TO DO HER JUSTICE, HAD, IN THE FIRST ARDOUR OF FEMALE ALARM,
SET SERIOUSLY TO THINK WHAT COULD BE DONE, AND HAD FINALLY PROPOSED
THESE TWO BRANCHES OF ECONOMY, TO CUT OFF SOME UNNECESSARY CHARITIES,
AND TO REFRAIN FROM NEW FURNISHING THE DRAWING-ROOM; TO WHICH
EXPEDIENTS SHE AFTERWARDS ADDED THE HAPPY THOUGHT OF THEIR TAKING NO
PRESENT DOWN TO ANNE, AS HAD BEEN THE USUAL YEARLY CUSTOM.  BUT THESE
MEASURES, HOWEVER GOOD IN THEMSELVES, WERE INSUFFICIENT FOR THE REAL
EXTENT OF THE EVIL, THE WHOLE OF WHICH SIR WALTER FOUND HIMSELF OBLIGED
TO CONFESS TO HER SOON AFTERWARDS.  ELIZABETH HAD NOTHING TO PROPOSE OF
DEEPER EFFICACY.  SHE FELT HERSELF ILL-USED AND UNFORTUNATE, AS DID HER
FATHER; AND THEY WERE NEITHER OF THEM ABLE TO DEVISE ANY MEANS OF
LESSENING THEIR EXPENSES WITHOUT COMPROMISING THEIR DIGNITY, OR
RELINQUISHING THEIR COMFORTS IN A WAY NOT TO BE BORNE.

THERE WAS ONLY A SMALL PART OF HIS ESTATE THAT SIR WALTER COULD DISPOSE
OF; BUT HAD EVERY ACRE BEEN ALIENABLE, IT WOULD HAVE MADE NO
DIFFERENCE.  HE HAD CONDESCENDED TO MORTGAGE AS FAR AS HE HAD THE
POWER, BUT HE WOULD NEVER CONDESCEND TO SELL.  NO; HE WOULD NEVER
DISGRACE HIS NAME SO FAR.  THE KELLYNCH ESTATE SHOULD BE TRANSMITTED
WHOLE AND ENTIRE, AS HE HAD RECEIVED IT.

THEIR TWO CONFIDENTIAL FRIENDS, MR SHEPHERD, WHO LIVED IN THE
NEIGHBOURING MARKET TOWN, AND LADY RUSSELL, WERE CALLED TO ADVISE THEM;
AND BOTH FATHER AND DAUGHTER SEEMED TO EXPECT THAT SOMETHING SHOULD BE
STRUCK OUT BY ONE OR THE OTHER TO REMOVE THEIR EMBARRASSMENTS AND
REDUCE THEIR EXPENDITURE, WITHOUT INVOLVING THE LOSS OF ANY INDULGENCE
OF TASTE OR PRIDE.



CHAPTER 2


MR SHEPHERD, A CIVIL, CAUTIOUS LAWYER, WHO, WHATEVER MIGHT BE HIS HOLD
OR HIS VIEWS ON SIR WALTER, WOULD RATHER HAVE THE DISAGREEABLE PROMPTED
BY ANYBODY ELSE, EXCUSED HIMSELF FROM OFFERING THE SLIGHTEST HINT, AND
ONLY BEGGED LEAVE TO RECOMMEND AN IMPLICIT REFERENCE TO THE EXCELLENT
JUDGEMENT OF LADY RUSSELL, FROM WHOSE KNOWN GOOD SENSE HE FULLY
EXPECTED TO HAVE JUST SUCH RESOLUTE MEASURES ADVISED AS HE MEANT TO SEE
FINALLY ADOPTED.

LADY RUSSELL WAS MOST ANXIOUSLY ZEALOUS ON THE SUBJECT, AND GAVE IT
MUCH SERIOUS CONSIDERATION.  SHE WAS A WOMAN RATHER OF SOUND THAN OF
QUICK ABILITIES, WHOSE DIFFICULTIES IN COMING TO ANY DECISION IN THIS
INSTANCE WERE GREAT, FROM THE OPPOSITION OF TWO LEADING PRINCIPLES.
SHE WAS OF STRICT INTEGRITY HERSELF, WITH A DELICATE SENSE OF HONOUR;
BUT SHE WAS AS DESIROUS OF SAVING SIR WALTER'S FEELINGS, AS SOLICITOUS
FOR THE CREDIT OF THE FAMILY, AS ARISTOCRATIC IN HER IDEAS OF WHAT WAS
DUE TO THEM, AS ANYBODY OF SENSE AND HONESTY COULD WELL BE.  SHE WAS A
BENEVOLENT, CHARITABLE, GOOD WOMAN, AND CAPABLE OF STRONG ATTACHMENTS,
MOST CORRECT IN HER CONDUCT, STRICT IN HER NOTIONS OF DECORUM, AND WITH
MANNERS THAT WERE HELD A STANDARD OF GOOD-BREEDING.  SHE HAD A
CULTIVATED MIND, AND WAS, GENERALLY SPEAKING, RATIONAL AND CONSISTENT;
BUT SHE HAD PREJUDICES ON THE SIDE OF ANCESTRY; SHE HAD A VALUE FOR
RANK AND CONSEQUENCE, WHICH BLINDED HER A LITTLE TO THE FAULTS OF THOSE
WHO POSSESSED THEM.  HERSELF THE WIDOW OF ONLY A KNIGHT, SHE GAVE THE
DIGNITY OF A BARONET ALL ITS DUE; AND SIR WALTER, INDEPENDENT OF HIS
CLAIMS AS AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE, AN ATTENTIVE NEIGHBOUR, AN OBLIGING
LANDLORD, THE HUSBAND OF HER VERY DEAR FRIEND, THE FATHER OF ANNE AND
HER SISTERS, WAS, AS BEING SIR WALTER, IN HER APPREHENSION, ENTITLED TO
A GREAT DEAL OF COMPASSION AND CONSIDERATION UNDER HIS PRESENT
DIFFICULTIES.

THEY MUST RETRENCH; THAT DID NOT ADMIT OF A DOUBT.  BUT SHE WAS VERY
ANXIOUS TO HAVE IT DONE WITH THE LEAST POSSIBLE PAIN TO HIM AND
ELIZABETH. SHE DREW UP PLANS OF ECONOMY, SHE MADE EXACT CALCULATIONS,
AND SHE DID WHAT NOBODY ELSE THOUGHT OF DOING:  SHE CONSULTED ANNE, WHO
NEVER SEEMED CONSIDERED BY THE OTHERS AS HAVING ANY INTEREST IN THE
QUESTION. SHE CONSULTED, AND IN A DEGREE WAS INFLUENCED BY HER IN
MARKING OUT THE SCHEME OF RETRENCHMENT WHICH WAS AT LAST SUBMITTED TO
SIR WALTER. EVERY EMENDATION OF ANNE'S HAD BEEN ON THE SIDE OF HONESTY
AGAINST IMPORTANCE.  SHE WANTED MORE VIGOROUS MEASURES, A MORE COMPLETE
REFORMATION, A QUICKER RELEASE FROM DEBT, A MUCH HIGHER TONE OF
INDIFFERENCE FOR EVERYTHING BUT JUSTICE AND EQUITY.

"IF WE CAN PERSUADE YOUR FATHER TO ALL THIS," SAID LADY RUSSELL,
LOOKING OVER HER PAPER, "MUCH MAY BE DONE.  IF HE WILL ADOPT THESE
REGULATIONS, IN SEVEN YEARS HE WILL BE CLEAR; AND I HOPE WE MAY BE ABLE
TO CONVINCE HIM AND ELIZABETH, THAT KELLYNCH HALL HAS A RESPECTABILITY
IN ITSELF WHICH CANNOT BE AFFECTED BY THESE REDUCTIONS; AND THAT THE
TRUE DIGNITY OF SIR WALTER ELLIOT WILL BE VERY FAR FROM LESSENED IN THE
EYES OF SENSIBLE PEOPLE, BY ACTING LIKE A MAN OF PRINCIPLE.  WHAT WILL
HE BE DOING, IN FACT, BUT WHAT VERY MANY OF OUR FIRST FAMILIES HAVE
DONE, OR OUGHT TO DO?  THERE WILL BE NOTHING SINGULAR IN HIS CASE; AND
IT IS SINGULARITY WHICH OFTEN MAKES THE WORST PART OF OUR SUFFERING, AS
IT ALWAYS DOES OF OUR CONDUCT.  I HAVE GREAT HOPE OF PREVAILING.  WE
MUST BE SERIOUS AND DECIDED; FOR AFTER ALL, THE PERSON WHO HAS
CONTRACTED DEBTS MUST PAY THEM; AND THOUGH A GREAT DEAL IS DUE TO THE
FEELINGS OF THE GENTLEMAN, AND THE HEAD OF A HOUSE, LIKE YOUR FATHER,
THERE IS STILL MORE DUE TO THE CHARACTER OF AN HONEST MAN."

THIS WAS THE PRINCIPLE ON WHICH ANNE WANTED HER FATHER TO BE
PROCEEDING, HIS FRIENDS TO BE URGING HIM.  SHE CONSIDERED IT AS AN ACT
OF INDISPENSABLE DUTY TO CLEAR AWAY THE CLAIMS OF CREDITORS WITH ALL
THE EXPEDITION WHICH THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE RETRENCHMENTS COULD SECURE,
AND SAW NO DIGNITY IN ANYTHING SHORT OF IT.  SHE WANTED IT TO BE
PRESCRIBED, AND FELT AS A DUTY.  SHE RATED LADY RUSSELL'S INFLUENCE
HIGHLY; AND AS TO THE SEVERE DEGREE OF SELF-DENIAL WHICH HER OWN
CONSCIENCE PROMPTED, SHE BELIEVED THERE MIGHT BE LITTLE MORE DIFFICULTY
IN PERSUADING THEM TO A COMPLETE, THAN TO HALF A REFORMATION.  HER
KNOWLEDGE OF HER FATHER AND ELIZABETH INCLINED HER TO THINK THAT THE
SACRIFICE OF ONE PAIR OF HORSES WOULD BE HARDLY LESS PAINFUL THAN OF
BOTH, AND SO ON, THROUGH THE WHOLE LIST OF LADY RUSSELL'S TOO GENTLE
REDUCTIONS.

HOW ANNE'S MORE RIGID REQUISITIONS MIGHT HAVE BEEN TAKEN IS OF LITTLE
CONSEQUENCE.  LADY RUSSELL'S HAD NO SUCCESS AT ALL: COULD NOT BE PUT UP
WITH, WERE NOT TO BE BORNE. "WHAT! EVERY COMFORT OF LIFE KNOCKED OFF!
JOURNEYS, LONDON, SERVANTS, HORSES, TABLE--CONTRACTIONS AND
RESTRICTIONS EVERY WHERE!  TO LIVE NO LONGER WITH THE DECENCIES EVEN OF
A PRIVATE GENTLEMAN!  NO, HE WOULD SOONER QUIT KELLYNCH HALL AT ONCE,
THAN REMAIN IN IT ON SUCH DISGRACEFUL TERMS."

"QUIT KELLYNCH HALL."  THE HINT WAS IMMEDIATELY TAKEN UP BY MR
SHEPHERD, WHOSE INTEREST WAS INVOLVED IN THE REALITY OF SIR WALTER'S
RETRENCHING, AND WHO WAS PERFECTLY PERSUADED THAT NOTHING WOULD BE DONE
WITHOUT A CHANGE OF ABODE.  "SINCE THE IDEA HAD BEEN STARTED IN THE
VERY QUARTER WHICH OUGHT TO DICTATE, HE HAD NO SCRUPLE," HE SAID, "IN
CONFESSING HIS JUDGEMENT TO BE ENTIRELY ON THAT SIDE.  IT DID NOT
APPEAR TO HIM THAT SIR WALTER COULD MATERIALLY ALTER HIS STYLE OF
LIVING IN A HOUSE WHICH HAD SUCH A CHARACTER OF HOSPITALITY AND ANCIENT
DIGNITY TO SUPPORT.  IN ANY OTHER PLACE SIR WALTER MIGHT JUDGE FOR
HIMSELF; AND WOULD BE LOOKED UP TO, AS REGULATING THE MODES OF LIFE IN
WHATEVER WAY HE MIGHT CHOOSE TO MODEL HIS HOUSEHOLD."

SIR WALTER WOULD QUIT KELLYNCH HALL; AND AFTER A VERY FEW DAYS MORE OF
DOUBT AND INDECISION, THE GREAT QUESTION OF WHITHER HE SHOULD GO WAS
SETTLED, AND THE FIRST OUTLINE OF THIS IMPORTANT CHANGE MADE OUT.

THERE HAD BEEN THREE ALTERNATIVES, LONDON, BATH, OR ANOTHER HOUSE IN
THE COUNTRY.  ALL ANNE'S WISHES HAD BEEN FOR THE LATTER.  A SMALL HOUSE
IN THEIR OWN NEIGHBOURHOOD, WHERE THEY MIGHT STILL HAVE LADY RUSSELL'S
SOCIETY, STILL BE NEAR MARY, AND STILL HAVE THE PLEASURE OF SOMETIMES
SEEING THE LAWNS AND GROVES OF KELLYNCH, WAS THE OBJECT OF HER
AMBITION.  BUT THE USUAL FATE OF ANNE ATTENDED HER, IN HAVING SOMETHING
VERY OPPOSITE FROM HER INCLINATION FIXED ON.  SHE DISLIKED BATH, AND
DID NOT THINK IT AGREED WITH HER; AND BATH WAS TO BE HER HOME.

SIR WALTER HAD AT FIRST THOUGHT MORE OF LONDON; BUT MR SHEPHERD FELT
THAT HE COULD NOT BE TRUSTED IN LONDON, AND HAD BEEN SKILFUL ENOUGH TO
DISSUADE HIM FROM IT, AND MAKE BATH PREFERRED.  IT WAS A MUCH SAFER
PLACE FOR A GENTLEMAN IN HIS PREDICAMENT:  HE MIGHT THERE BE IMPORTANT
AT COMPARATIVELY LITTLE EXPENSE.  TWO MATERIAL ADVANTAGES OF BATH OVER
LONDON HAD OF COURSE BEEN GIVEN ALL THEIR WEIGHT:  ITS MORE CONVENIENT
DISTANCE FROM KELLYNCH, ONLY FIFTY MILES, AND LADY RUSSELL'S SPENDING
SOME PART OF EVERY WINTER THERE; AND TO THE VERY GREAT SATISFACTION OF
LADY RUSSELL, WHOSE FIRST VIEWS ON THE PROJECTED CHANGE HAD BEEN FOR
BATH, SIR WALTER AND ELIZABETH WERE INDUCED TO BELIEVE THAT THEY SHOULD
LOSE NEITHER CONSEQUENCE NOR ENJOYMENT BY SETTLING THERE.

LADY RUSSELL FELT OBLIGED TO OPPOSE HER DEAR ANNE'S KNOWN WISHES.  IT
WOULD BE TOO MUCH TO EXPECT SIR WALTER TO DESCEND INTO A SMALL HOUSE IN
HIS OWN NEIGHBOURHOOD.  ANNE HERSELF WOULD HAVE FOUND THE
MORTIFICATIONS OF IT MORE THAN SHE FORESAW, AND TO SIR WALTER'S
FEELINGS THEY MUST HAVE BEEN DREADFUL.  AND WITH REGARD TO ANNE'S
DISLIKE OF BATH, SHE CONSIDERED IT AS A PREJUDICE AND MISTAKE ARISING,
FIRST, FROM THE CIRCUMSTANCE OF HER HAVING BEEN THREE YEARS AT SCHOOL
THERE, AFTER HER MOTHER'S DEATH; AND SECONDLY, FROM HER HAPPENING TO BE
NOT IN PERFECTLY GOOD SPIRITS THE ONLY WINTER WHICH SHE HAD AFTERWARDS
SPENT THERE WITH HERSELF.

LADY RUSSELL WAS FOND OF BATH, IN SHORT, AND DISPOSED TO THINK IT MUST
SUIT THEM ALL; AND AS TO HER YOUNG FRIEND'S HEALTH, BY PASSING ALL THE
WARM MONTHS WITH HER AT KELLYNCH LODGE, EVERY DANGER WOULD BE AVOIDED;
AND IT WAS IN FACT, A CHANGE WHICH MUST DO BOTH HEALTH AND SPIRITS
GOOD.  ANNE HAD BEEN TOO LITTLE FROM HOME, TOO LITTLE SEEN. HER SPIRITS
WERE NOT HIGH.  A LARGER SOCIETY WOULD IMPROVE THEM.  SHE WANTED HER TO
BE MORE KNOWN.

THE UNDESIRABLENESS OF ANY OTHER HOUSE IN THE SAME NEIGHBOURHOOD FOR
SIR WALTER WAS CERTAINLY MUCH STRENGTHENED BY ONE PART, AND A VERY
MATERIAL PART OF THE SCHEME, WHICH HAD BEEN HAPPILY ENGRAFTED ON THE
BEGINNING.  HE WAS NOT ONLY TO QUIT HIS HOME, BUT TO SEE IT IN THE
HANDS OF OTHERS; A TRIAL OF FORTITUDE, WHICH STRONGER HEADS THAN SIR
WALTER'S HAVE FOUND TOO MUCH.  KELLYNCH HALL WAS TO BE LET.  THIS,
HOWEVER, WAS A PROFOUND SECRET, NOT TO BE BREATHED BEYOND THEIR OWN
CIRCLE.

SIR WALTER COULD NOT HAVE BORNE THE DEGRADATION OF BEING KNOWN TO
DESIGN LETTING HIS HOUSE.  MR SHEPHERD HAD ONCE MENTIONED THE WORD
"ADVERTISE," BUT NEVER DARED APPROACH IT AGAIN.  SIR WALTER SPURNED THE
IDEA OF ITS BEING OFFERED IN ANY MANNER; FORBAD THE SLIGHTEST HINT
BEING DROPPED OF HIS HAVING SUCH AN INTENTION; AND IT WAS ONLY ON THE
SUPPOSITION OF HIS BEING SPONTANEOUSLY SOLICITED BY SOME MOST
UNEXCEPTIONABLE APPLICANT, ON HIS OWN TERMS, AND AS A GREAT FAVOUR,
THAT HE WOULD LET IT AT ALL.

HOW QUICK COME THE REASONS FOR APPROVING WHAT WE LIKE!  LADY RUSSELL
HAD ANOTHER EXCELLENT ONE AT HAND, FOR BEING EXTREMELY GLAD THAT SIR
WALTER AND HIS FAMILY WERE TO REMOVE FROM THE COUNTRY.  ELIZABETH HAD
BEEN LATELY FORMING AN INTIMACY, WHICH SHE WISHED TO SEE INTERRUPTED.
IT WAS WITH THE DAUGHTER OF MR SHEPHERD, WHO HAD RETURNED, AFTER AN
UNPROSPEROUS MARRIAGE, TO HER FATHER'S HOUSE, WITH THE ADDITIONAL
BURDEN OF TWO CHILDREN.  SHE WAS A CLEVER YOUNG WOMAN, WHO UNDERSTOOD
THE ART OF PLEASING--THE ART OF PLEASING, AT LEAST, AT KELLYNCH HALL;
AND WHO HAD MADE HERSELF SO ACCEPTABLE TO MISS ELLIOT, AS TO HAVE BEEN
ALREADY STAYING THERE MORE THAN ONCE, IN SPITE OF ALL THAT LADY
RUSSELL, WHO THOUGHT IT A FRIENDSHIP QUITE OUT OF PLACE, COULD HINT OF
CAUTION AND RESERVE.

LADY RUSSELL, INDEED, HAD SCARCELY ANY INFLUENCE WITH ELIZABETH, AND
SEEMED TO LOVE HER, RATHER BECAUSE SHE WOULD LOVE HER, THAN BECAUSE
ELIZABETH DESERVED IT.  SHE HAD NEVER RECEIVED FROM HER MORE THAN
OUTWARD ATTENTION, NOTHING BEYOND THE OBSERVANCES OF COMPLAISANCE; HAD
NEVER SUCCEEDED IN ANY POINT WHICH SHE WANTED TO CARRY, AGAINST
PREVIOUS INCLINATION.  SHE HAD BEEN REPEATEDLY VERY EARNEST IN TRYING
TO GET ANNE INCLUDED IN THE VISIT TO LONDON, SENSIBLY OPEN TO ALL THE
INJUSTICE AND ALL THE DISCREDIT OF THE SELFISH ARRANGEMENTS WHICH SHUT
HER OUT, AND ON MANY LESSER OCCASIONS HAD ENDEAVOURED TO GIVE ELIZABETH
THE ADVANTAGE OF HER OWN BETTER JUDGEMENT AND EXPERIENCE; BUT ALWAYS IN
VAIN:  ELIZABETH WOULD GO HER OWN WAY; AND NEVER HAD SHE PURSUED IT IN
MORE DECIDED OPPOSITION TO LADY RUSSELL THAN IN THIS SELECTION OF MRS
CLAY; TURNING FROM THE SOCIETY OF SO DESERVING A SISTER, TO BESTOW HER
AFFECTION AND CONFIDENCE ON ONE WHO OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN NOTHING TO HER
BUT THE OBJECT OF DISTANT CIVILITY.

FROM SITUATION, MRS CLAY WAS, IN LADY RUSSELL'S ESTIMATE, A VERY
UNEQUAL, AND IN HER CHARACTER SHE BELIEVED A VERY DANGEROUS COMPANION;
AND A REMOVAL THAT WOULD LEAVE MRS CLAY BEHIND, AND BRING A CHOICE OF
MORE SUITABLE INTIMATES WITHIN MISS ELLIOT'S REACH, WAS THEREFORE AN
OBJECT OF FIRST-RATE IMPORTANCE.



CHAPTER 3


"I MUST TAKE LEAVE TO OBSERVE, SIR WALTER," SAID MR SHEPHERD ONE
MORNING AT KELLYNCH HALL, AS HE LAID DOWN THE NEWSPAPER, "THAT THE
PRESENT JUNCTURE IS MUCH IN OUR FAVOUR.  THIS PEACE WILL BE TURNING ALL
OUR RICH NAVAL OFFICERS ASHORE.  THEY WILL BE ALL WANTING A HOME.
COULD NOT BE A BETTER TIME, SIR WALTER, FOR HAVING A CHOICE OF TENANTS,
VERY RESPONSIBLE TENANTS.  MANY A NOBLE FORTUNE HAS BEEN MADE DURING
THE WAR.  IF A RICH ADMIRAL WERE TO COME IN OUR WAY, SIR WALTER--"

"HE WOULD BE A VERY LUCKY MAN, SHEPHERD," REPLIED SIR WALTER; "THAT'S
ALL I HAVE TO REMARK.  A PRIZE INDEED WOULD KELLYNCH HALL BE TO HIM;
RATHER THE GREATEST PRIZE OF ALL, LET HIM HAVE TAKEN EVER SO MANY
BEFORE; HEY, SHEPHERD?"

MR SHEPHERD LAUGHED, AS HE KNEW HE MUST, AT THIS WIT, AND THEN ADDED--

"I PRESUME TO OBSERVE, SIR WALTER, THAT, IN THE WAY OF BUSINESS,
GENTLEMEN OF THE NAVY ARE WELL TO DEAL WITH.  I HAVE HAD A LITTLE
KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR METHODS OF DOING BUSINESS; AND I AM FREE TO CONFESS
THAT THEY HAVE VERY LIBERAL NOTIONS, AND ARE AS LIKELY TO MAKE
DESIRABLE TENANTS AS ANY SET OF PEOPLE ONE SHOULD MEET WITH.
THEREFORE, SIR WALTER, WHAT I WOULD TAKE LEAVE TO SUGGEST IS, THAT IF
IN CONSEQUENCE OF ANY RUMOURS GETTING ABROAD OF YOUR INTENTION; WHICH
MUST BE CONTEMPLATED AS A POSSIBLE THING, BECAUSE WE KNOW HOW DIFFICULT
IT IS TO KEEP THE ACTIONS AND DESIGNS OF ONE PART OF THE WORLD FROM THE
NOTICE AND CURIOSITY OF THE OTHER; CONSEQUENCE HAS ITS TAX; I, JOHN
SHEPHERD, MIGHT CONCEAL ANY FAMILY-MATTERS THAT I CHOSE, FOR NOBODY
WOULD THINK IT WORTH THEIR WHILE TO OBSERVE ME; BUT SIR WALTER ELLIOT
HAS EYES UPON HIM WHICH IT MAY BE VERY DIFFICULT TO ELUDE; AND
THEREFORE, THUS MUCH I VENTURE UPON, THAT IT WILL NOT GREATLY SURPRISE
ME IF, WITH ALL OUR CAUTION, SOME RUMOUR OF THE TRUTH SHOULD GET
ABROAD; IN THE SUPPOSITION OF WHICH, AS I WAS GOING TO OBSERVE, SINCE
APPLICATIONS WILL UNQUESTIONABLY FOLLOW, I SHOULD THINK ANY FROM OUR
WEALTHY NAVAL COMMANDERS PARTICULARLY WORTH ATTENDING TO; AND BEG LEAVE
TO ADD, THAT TWO HOURS WILL BRING ME OVER AT ANY TIME, TO SAVE YOU THE
TROUBLE OF REPLYING."

SIR WALTER ONLY NODDED.  BUT SOON AFTERWARDS, RISING AND PACING THE
ROOM, HE OBSERVED SARCASTICALLY--

"THERE ARE FEW AMONG THE GENTLEMEN OF THE NAVY, I IMAGINE, WHO WOULD
NOT BE SURPRISED TO FIND THEMSELVES IN A HOUSE OF THIS DESCRIPTION."

"THEY WOULD LOOK AROUND THEM, NO DOUBT, AND BLESS THEIR GOOD FORTUNE,"
SAID MRS CLAY, FOR MRS CLAY WAS PRESENT:  HER FATHER HAD DRIVEN HER
OVER, NOTHING BEING OF SO MUCH USE TO MRS CLAY'S HEALTH AS A DRIVE TO
KELLYNCH: "BUT I QUITE AGREE WITH MY FATHER IN THINKING A SAILOR MIGHT
BE A VERY DESIRABLE TENANT.  I HAVE KNOWN A GOOD DEAL OF THE
PROFESSION; AND BESIDES THEIR LIBERALITY, THEY ARE SO NEAT AND CAREFUL
IN ALL THEIR WAYS!  THESE VALUABLE PICTURES OF YOURS, SIR WALTER, IF
YOU CHOSE TO LEAVE THEM, WOULD BE PERFECTLY SAFE.  EVERYTHING IN AND
ABOUT THE HOUSE WOULD BE TAKEN SUCH EXCELLENT CARE OF!  THE GARDENS AND
SHRUBBERIES WOULD BE KEPT IN ALMOST AS HIGH ORDER AS THEY ARE NOW.  YOU
NEED NOT BE AFRAID, MISS ELLIOT, OF YOUR OWN SWEET FLOWER GARDENS BEING
NEGLECTED."

"AS TO ALL THAT," REJOINED SIR WALTER COOLLY, "SUPPOSING I WERE INDUCED
TO LET MY HOUSE, I HAVE BY NO MEANS MADE UP MY MIND AS TO THE
PRIVILEGES TO BE ANNEXED TO IT.  I AM NOT PARTICULARLY DISPOSED TO
FAVOUR A TENANT.  THE PARK WOULD BE OPEN TO HIM OF COURSE, AND FEW NAVY
OFFICERS, OR MEN OF ANY OTHER DESCRIPTION, CAN HAVE HAD SUCH A RANGE;
BUT WHAT RESTRICTIONS I MIGHT IMPOSE ON THE USE OF THE
PLEASURE-GROUNDS, IS ANOTHER THING.  I AM NOT FOND OF THE IDEA OF MY
SHRUBBERIES BEING ALWAYS APPROACHABLE; AND I SHOULD RECOMMEND MISS
ELLIOT TO BE ON HER GUARD WITH RESPECT TO HER FLOWER GARDEN.  I AM VERY
LITTLE DISPOSED TO GRANT A TENANT OF KELLYNCH HALL ANY EXTRAORDINARY
FAVOUR, I ASSURE YOU, BE HE SAILOR OR SOLDIER."

AFTER A SHORT PAUSE, MR SHEPHERD PRESUMED TO SAY--

"IN ALL THESE CASES, THERE ARE ESTABLISHED USAGES WHICH MAKE EVERYTHING
PLAIN AND EASY BETWEEN LANDLORD AND TENANT.  YOUR INTEREST, SIR WALTER,
IS IN PRETTY SAFE HANDS.  DEPEND UPON ME FOR TAKING CARE THAT NO TENANT
HAS MORE THAN HIS JUST RIGHTS.  I VENTURE TO HINT, THAT SIR WALTER
ELLIOT CANNOT BE HALF SO JEALOUS FOR HIS OWN, AS JOHN SHEPHERD WILL BE
FOR HIM."

HERE ANNE SPOKE--

"THE NAVY, I THINK, WHO HAVE DONE SO MUCH FOR US, HAVE AT LEAST AN
EQUAL CLAIM WITH ANY OTHER SET OF MEN, FOR ALL THE COMFORTS AND ALL THE
PRIVILEGES WHICH ANY HOME CAN GIVE.  SAILORS WORK HARD ENOUGH FOR THEIR
COMFORTS, WE MUST ALL ALLOW."

"VERY TRUE, VERY TRUE.  WHAT MISS ANNE SAYS, IS VERY TRUE," WAS MR
SHEPHERD'S REJOINDER, AND "OH! CERTAINLY," WAS HIS DAUGHTER'S; BUT SIR
WALTER'S REMARK WAS, SOON AFTERWARDS--

"THE PROFESSION HAS ITS UTILITY, BUT I SHOULD BE SORRY TO SEE ANY
FRIEND OF MINE BELONGING TO IT."

"INDEED!" WAS THE REPLY, AND WITH A LOOK OF SURPRISE.

"YES; IT IS IN TWO POINTS OFFENSIVE TO ME; I HAVE TWO STRONG GROUNDS OF
OBJECTION TO IT.  FIRST, AS BEING THE MEANS OF BRINGING PERSONS OF
OBSCURE BIRTH INTO UNDUE DISTINCTION, AND RAISING MEN TO HONOURS WHICH
THEIR FATHERS AND GRANDFATHERS NEVER DREAMT OF; AND SECONDLY, AS IT
CUTS UP A MAN'S YOUTH AND VIGOUR MOST HORRIBLY; A SAILOR GROWS OLD
SOONER THAN ANY OTHER MAN.  I HAVE OBSERVED IT ALL MY LIFE.  A MAN IS
IN GREATER DANGER IN THE NAVY OF BEING INSULTED BY THE RISE OF ONE
WHOSE FATHER, HIS FATHER MIGHT HAVE DISDAINED TO SPEAK TO, AND OF
BECOMING PREMATURELY AN OBJECT OF DISGUST HIMSELF, THAN IN ANY OTHER
LINE.  ONE DAY LAST SPRING, IN TOWN, I WAS IN COMPANY WITH TWO MEN,
STRIKING INSTANCES OF WHAT I AM TALKING OF; LORD ST IVES, WHOSE FATHER
WE ALL KNOW TO HAVE BEEN A COUNTRY CURATE, WITHOUT BREAD TO EAT; I WAS
TO GIVE PLACE TO LORD ST IVES, AND A CERTAIN ADMIRAL BALDWIN, THE MOST
DEPLORABLE-LOOKING PERSONAGE YOU CAN IMAGINE; HIS FACE THE COLOUR OF
MAHOGANY, ROUGH AND RUGGED TO THE LAST DEGREE; ALL LINES AND WRINKLES,
NINE GREY HAIRS OF A SIDE, AND NOTHING BUT A DAB OF POWDER AT TOP.  'IN
THE NAME OF HEAVEN, WHO IS THAT OLD FELLOW?' SAID I TO A FRIEND OF MINE
WHO WAS STANDING NEAR, (SIR BASIL MORLEY).  'OLD FELLOW!' CRIED SIR
BASIL, 'IT IS ADMIRAL BALDWIN.  WHAT DO YOU TAKE HIS AGE TO BE?'
'SIXTY,' SAID I, 'OR PERHAPS SIXTY-TWO.' 'FORTY,' REPLIED SIR BASIL,
'FORTY, AND NO MORE.'  PICTURE TO YOURSELVES MY AMAZEMENT; I SHALL NOT
EASILY FORGET ADMIRAL BALDWIN.  I NEVER SAW QUITE SO WRETCHED AN
EXAMPLE OF WHAT A SEA-FARING LIFE CAN DO; BUT TO A DEGREE, I KNOW IT IS
THE SAME WITH THEM ALL:  THEY ARE ALL KNOCKED ABOUT, AND EXPOSED TO
EVERY CLIMATE, AND EVERY WEATHER, TILL THEY ARE NOT FIT TO BE SEEN.  IT
IS A PITY THEY ARE NOT KNOCKED ON THE HEAD AT ONCE, BEFORE THEY REACH
ADMIRAL BALDWIN'S AGE."

"NAY, SIR WALTER," CRIED MRS CLAY, "THIS IS BEING SEVERE INDEED.  HAVE
A LITTLE MERCY ON THE POOR MEN.  WE ARE NOT ALL BORN TO BE HANDSOME.
THE SEA IS NO BEAUTIFIER, CERTAINLY; SAILORS DO GROW OLD BETIMES; I
HAVE OBSERVED IT; THEY SOON LOSE THE LOOK OF YOUTH.  BUT THEN, IS NOT
IT THE SAME WITH MANY OTHER PROFESSIONS, PERHAPS MOST OTHER?  SOLDIERS,
IN ACTIVE SERVICE, ARE NOT AT ALL BETTER OFF:  AND EVEN IN THE QUIETER
PROFESSIONS, THERE IS A TOIL AND A LABOUR OF THE MIND, IF NOT OF THE
BODY, WHICH SELDOM LEAVES A MAN'S LOOKS TO THE NATURAL EFFECT OF TIME.
THE LAWYER PLODS, QUITE CARE-WORN; THE PHYSICIAN IS UP AT ALL HOURS,
AND TRAVELLING IN ALL WEATHER; AND EVEN THE CLERGYMAN--" SHE STOPT A
MOMENT TO CONSIDER WHAT MIGHT DO FOR THE CLERGYMAN;--"AND EVEN THE
CLERGYMAN, YOU KNOW IS OBLIGED TO GO INTO INFECTED ROOMS, AND EXPOSE
HIS HEALTH AND LOOKS TO ALL THE INJURY OF A POISONOUS ATMOSPHERE.  IN
FACT, AS I HAVE LONG BEEN CONVINCED, THOUGH EVERY PROFESSION IS
NECESSARY AND HONOURABLE IN ITS TURN, IT IS ONLY THE LOT OF THOSE WHO
ARE NOT OBLIGED TO FOLLOW ANY, WHO CAN LIVE IN A REGULAR WAY, IN THE
COUNTRY, CHOOSING THEIR OWN HOURS, FOLLOWING THEIR OWN PURSUITS, AND
LIVING ON THEIR OWN PROPERTY, WITHOUT THE TORMENT OF TRYING FOR MORE;
IT IS ONLY THEIR LOT, I SAY, TO HOLD THE BLESSINGS OF HEALTH AND A GOOD
APPEARANCE TO THE UTMOST: I KNOW NO OTHER SET OF MEN BUT WHAT LOSE
SOMETHING OF THEIR PERSONABLENESS WHEN THEY CEASE TO BE QUITE YOUNG."

IT SEEMED AS IF MR SHEPHERD, IN THIS ANXIETY TO BESPEAK SIR WALTER'S
GOOD WILL TOWARDS A NAVAL OFFICER AS TENANT, HAD BEEN GIFTED WITH
FORESIGHT; FOR THE VERY FIRST APPLICATION FOR THE HOUSE WAS FROM AN
ADMIRAL CROFT, WITH WHOM HE SHORTLY AFTERWARDS FELL INTO COMPANY IN
ATTENDING THE QUARTER SESSIONS AT TAUNTON; AND INDEED, HE HAD RECEIVED
A HINT OF THE ADMIRAL FROM A LONDON CORRESPONDENT.  BY THE REPORT WHICH
HE HASTENED OVER TO KELLYNCH TO MAKE, ADMIRAL CROFT WAS A NATIVE OF
SOMERSETSHIRE, WHO HAVING ACQUIRED A VERY HANDSOME FORTUNE, WAS WISHING
TO SETTLE IN HIS OWN COUNTRY, AND HAD COME DOWN TO TAUNTON IN ORDER TO
LOOK AT SOME ADVERTISED PLACES IN THAT IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD, WHICH,
HOWEVER, HAD NOT SUITED HIM; THAT ACCIDENTALLY HEARING--(IT WAS JUST AS
HE HAD FORETOLD, MR SHEPHERD OBSERVED, SIR WALTER'S CONCERNS COULD NOT
BE KEPT A SECRET,)--ACCIDENTALLY HEARING OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
KELLYNCH HALL BEING TO LET, AND UNDERSTANDING HIS (MR SHEPHERD'S)
CONNECTION WITH THE OWNER, HE HAD INTRODUCED HIMSELF TO HIM IN ORDER TO
MAKE PARTICULAR INQUIRIES, AND HAD, IN THE COURSE OF A PRETTY LONG
CONFERENCE, EXPRESSED AS STRONG AN INCLINATION FOR THE PLACE AS A MAN
WHO KNEW IT ONLY BY DESCRIPTION COULD FEEL; AND GIVEN MR SHEPHERD, IN
HIS EXPLICIT ACCOUNT OF HIMSELF, EVERY PROOF OF HIS BEING A MOST
RESPONSIBLE, ELIGIBLE TENANT.

"AND WHO IS ADMIRAL CROFT?" WAS SIR WALTER'S COLD SUSPICIOUS INQUIRY.

MR SHEPHERD ANSWERED FOR HIS BEING OF A GENTLEMAN'S FAMILY, AND
MENTIONED A PLACE; AND ANNE, AFTER THE LITTLE PAUSE WHICH FOLLOWED,
ADDED--

"HE IS A REAR ADMIRAL OF THE WHITE.  HE WAS IN THE TRAFALGAR ACTION,
AND HAS BEEN IN THE EAST INDIES SINCE; HE WAS STATIONED THERE, I
BELIEVE, SEVERAL YEARS."

"THEN I TAKE IT FOR GRANTED," OBSERVED SIR WALTER, "THAT HIS FACE IS
ABOUT AS ORANGE AS THE CUFFS AND CAPES OF MY LIVERY."

MR SHEPHERD HASTENED TO ASSURE HIM, THAT ADMIRAL CROFT WAS A VERY HALE,
HEARTY, WELL-LOOKING MAN, A LITTLE WEATHER-BEATEN, TO BE SURE, BUT NOT
MUCH, AND QUITE THE GENTLEMAN IN ALL HIS NOTIONS AND BEHAVIOUR; NOT
LIKELY TO MAKE THE SMALLEST DIFFICULTY ABOUT TERMS, ONLY WANTED A
COMFORTABLE HOME, AND TO GET INTO IT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE; KNEW HE MUST
PAY FOR HIS CONVENIENCE; KNEW WHAT RENT A READY-FURNISHED HOUSE OF THAT
CONSEQUENCE MIGHT FETCH; SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SURPRISED IF SIR WALTER
HAD ASKED MORE; HAD INQUIRED ABOUT THE MANOR; WOULD BE GLAD OF THE
DEPUTATION, CERTAINLY, BUT MADE NO GREAT POINT OF IT; SAID HE SOMETIMES
TOOK OUT A GUN, BUT NEVER KILLED; QUITE THE GENTLEMAN.

MR SHEPHERD WAS ELOQUENT ON THE SUBJECT; POINTING OUT ALL THE
CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE ADMIRAL'S FAMILY, WHICH MADE HIM PECULIARLY
DESIRABLE AS A TENANT.  HE WAS A MARRIED MAN, AND WITHOUT CHILDREN; THE
VERY STATE TO BE WISHED FOR.  A HOUSE WAS NEVER TAKEN GOOD CARE OF, MR
SHEPHERD OBSERVED, WITHOUT A LADY: HE DID NOT KNOW, WHETHER FURNITURE
MIGHT NOT BE IN DANGER OF SUFFERING AS MUCH WHERE THERE WAS NO LADY, AS
WHERE THERE WERE MANY CHILDREN.  A LADY, WITHOUT A FAMILY, WAS THE VERY
BEST PRESERVER OF FURNITURE IN THE WORLD.  HE HAD SEEN MRS CROFT, TOO;
SHE WAS AT TAUNTON WITH THE ADMIRAL, AND HAD BEEN PRESENT ALMOST ALL
THE TIME THEY WERE TALKING THE MATTER OVER.

"AND A VERY WELL-SPOKEN, GENTEEL, SHREWD LADY, SHE SEEMED TO BE,"
CONTINUED HE; "ASKED MORE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE HOUSE, AND TERMS, AND
TAXES, THAN THE ADMIRAL HIMSELF, AND SEEMED MORE CONVERSANT WITH
BUSINESS; AND MOREOVER, SIR WALTER, I FOUND SHE WAS NOT QUITE
UNCONNECTED IN THIS COUNTRY, ANY MORE THAN HER HUSBAND; THAT IS TO SAY,
SHE IS SISTER TO A GENTLEMAN WHO DID LIVE AMONGST US ONCE; SHE TOLD ME
SO HERSELF: SISTER TO THE GENTLEMAN WHO LIVED A FEW YEARS BACK AT
MONKFORD. BLESS ME! WHAT WAS HIS NAME? AT THIS MOMENT I CANNOT
RECOLLECT HIS NAME, THOUGH I HAVE HEARD IT SO LATELY. PENELOPE, MY
DEAR, CAN YOU HELP ME TO THE NAME OF THE GENTLEMAN WHO LIVED AT
MONKFORD: MRS CROFT'S BROTHER?"

BUT MRS CLAY WAS TALKING SO EAGERLY WITH MISS ELLIOT, THAT SHE DID NOT
HEAR THE APPEAL.

"I HAVE NO CONCEPTION WHOM YOU CAN MEAN, SHEPHERD; I REMEMBER NO
GENTLEMAN RESIDENT AT MONKFORD SINCE THE TIME OF OLD GOVERNOR TRENT."

"BLESS ME! HOW VERY ODD!  I SHALL FORGET MY OWN NAME SOON, I SUPPOSE.
A NAME THAT I AM SO VERY WELL ACQUAINTED WITH; KNEW THE GENTLEMAN SO
WELL BY SIGHT; SEEN HIM A HUNDRED TIMES; CAME TO CONSULT ME ONCE, I
REMEMBER, ABOUT A TRESPASS OF ONE OF HIS NEIGHBOURS; FARMER'S MAN
BREAKING INTO HIS ORCHARD; WALL TORN DOWN; APPLES STOLEN; CAUGHT IN THE
FACT; AND AFTERWARDS, CONTRARY TO MY JUDGEMENT, SUBMITTED TO AN
AMICABLE COMPROMISE.  VERY ODD INDEED!"

AFTER WAITING ANOTHER MOMENT--

"YOU MEAN MR WENTWORTH, I SUPPOSE?" SAID ANNE.

MR SHEPHERD WAS ALL GRATITUDE.

"WENTWORTH WAS THE VERY NAME!  MR WENTWORTH WAS THE VERY MAN.  HE HAD
THE CURACY OF MONKFORD, YOU KNOW, SIR WALTER, SOME TIME BACK, FOR TWO
OR THREE YEARS.  CAME THERE ABOUT THE YEAR ---5, I TAKE IT.  YOU
REMEMBER HIM, I AM SURE."

"WENTWORTH?  OH! AY,--MR WENTWORTH, THE CURATE OF MONKFORD.  YOU MISLED
ME BY THE TERM GENTLEMAN.  I THOUGHT YOU WERE SPEAKING OF SOME MAN OF
PROPERTY:  MR WENTWORTH WAS NOBODY, I REMEMBER; QUITE UNCONNECTED;
NOTHING TO DO WITH THE STRAFFORD FAMILY.  ONE WONDERS HOW THE NAMES OF
MANY OF OUR NOBILITY BECOME SO COMMON."

AS MR SHEPHERD PERCEIVED THAT THIS CONNEXION OF THE CROFTS DID THEM NO
SERVICE WITH SIR WALTER, HE MENTIONED IT NO MORE; RETURNING, WITH ALL
HIS ZEAL, TO DWELL ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES MORE INDISPUTABLY IN THEIR
FAVOUR; THEIR AGE, AND NUMBER, AND FORTUNE; THE HIGH IDEA THEY HAD
FORMED OF KELLYNCH HALL, AND EXTREME SOLICITUDE FOR THE ADVANTAGE OF
RENTING IT; MAKING IT APPEAR AS IF THEY RANKED NOTHING BEYOND THE
HAPPINESS OF BEING THE TENANTS OF SIR WALTER ELLIOT: AN EXTRAORDINARY
TASTE, CERTAINLY, COULD THEY HAVE BEEN SUPPOSED IN THE SECRET OF SIR
WALTER'S ESTIMATE OF THE DUES OF A TENANT.

IT SUCCEEDED, HOWEVER; AND THOUGH SIR WALTER MUST EVER LOOK WITH AN
EVIL EYE ON ANYONE INTENDING TO INHABIT THAT HOUSE, AND THINK THEM
INFINITELY TOO WELL OFF IN BEING PERMITTED TO RENT IT ON THE HIGHEST
TERMS, HE WAS TALKED INTO ALLOWING MR SHEPHERD TO PROCEED IN THE
TREATY, AND AUTHORISING HIM TO WAIT ON ADMIRAL CROFT, WHO STILL
REMAINED AT TAUNTON, AND FIX A DAY FOR THE HOUSE BEING SEEN.

SIR WALTER WAS NOT VERY WISE; BUT STILL HE HAD EXPERIENCE ENOUGH OF THE
WORLD TO FEEL, THAT A MORE UNOBJECTIONABLE TENANT, IN ALL ESSENTIALS,
THAN ADMIRAL CROFT BID FAIR TO BE, COULD HARDLY OFFER.  SO FAR WENT HIS
UNDERSTANDING; AND HIS VANITY SUPPLIED A LITTLE ADDITIONAL SOOTHING, IN
THE ADMIRAL'S SITUATION IN LIFE, WHICH WAS JUST HIGH ENOUGH, AND NOT
TOO HIGH.  "I HAVE LET MY HOUSE TO ADMIRAL CROFT," WOULD SOUND
EXTREMELY WELL; VERY MUCH BETTER THAN TO ANY MERE MR--; A MR (SAVE,
PERHAPS, SOME HALF DOZEN IN THE NATION,) ALWAYS NEEDS A NOTE OF
EXPLANATION.  AN ADMIRAL SPEAKS HIS OWN CONSEQUENCE, AND, AT THE SAME
TIME, CAN NEVER MAKE A BARONET LOOK SMALL.  IN ALL THEIR DEALINGS AND
INTERCOURSE, SIR WALTER ELLIOT MUST EVER HAVE THE PRECEDENCE.

NOTHING COULD BE DONE WITHOUT A REFERENCE TO ELIZABETH: BUT HER
INCLINATION WAS GROWING SO STRONG FOR A REMOVAL, THAT SHE WAS HAPPY TO
HAVE IT FIXED AND EXPEDITED BY A TENANT AT HAND; AND NOT A WORD TO
SUSPEND DECISION WAS UTTERED BY HER.

MR SHEPHERD WAS COMPLETELY EMPOWERED TO ACT; AND NO SOONER HAD SUCH AN
END BEEN REACHED, THAN ANNE, WHO HAD BEEN A MOST ATTENTIVE LISTENER TO
THE WHOLE, LEFT THE ROOM, TO SEEK THE COMFORT OF COOL AIR FOR HER
FLUSHED CHEEKS; AND AS SHE WALKED ALONG A FAVOURITE GROVE, SAID, WITH A
GENTLE SIGH, "A FEW MONTHS MORE, AND HE, PERHAPS, MAY BE WALKING HERE."



CHAPTER 4


HE WAS NOT MR WENTWORTH, THE FORMER CURATE OF MONKFORD, HOWEVER
SUSPICIOUS APPEARANCES MAY BE, BUT A CAPTAIN FREDERICK WENTWORTH, HIS
BROTHER, WHO BEING MADE COMMANDER IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE ACTION OFF ST
DOMINGO, AND NOT IMMEDIATELY EMPLOYED, HAD COME INTO SOMERSETSHIRE, IN
THE SUMMER OF 1806; AND HAVING NO PARENT LIVING, FOUND A HOME FOR HALF
A YEAR AT MONKFORD.  HE WAS, AT THAT TIME, A REMARKABLY FINE YOUNG MAN,
WITH A GREAT DEAL OF INTELLIGENCE, SPIRIT, AND BRILLIANCY; AND ANNE AN
EXTREMELY PRETTY GIRL, WITH GENTLENESS, MODESTY, TASTE, AND FEELING.
HALF THE SUM OF ATTRACTION, ON EITHER SIDE, MIGHT HAVE BEEN ENOUGH, FOR
HE HAD NOTHING TO DO, AND SHE HAD HARDLY ANYBODY TO LOVE; BUT THE
ENCOUNTER OF SUCH LAVISH RECOMMENDATIONS COULD NOT FAIL.  THEY WERE
GRADUALLY ACQUAINTED, AND WHEN ACQUAINTED, RAPIDLY AND DEEPLY IN LOVE.
IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO SAY WHICH HAD SEEN HIGHEST PERFECTION IN THE
OTHER, OR WHICH HAD BEEN THE HAPPIEST: SHE, IN RECEIVING HIS
DECLARATIONS AND PROPOSALS, OR HE IN HAVING THEM ACCEPTED.

A SHORT PERIOD OF EXQUISITE FELICITY FOLLOWED, AND BUT A SHORT ONE.
TROUBLES SOON AROSE.  SIR WALTER, ON BEING APPLIED TO, WITHOUT ACTUALLY
WITHHOLDING HIS CONSENT, OR SAYING IT SHOULD NEVER BE, GAVE IT ALL THE
NEGATIVE OF GREAT ASTONISHMENT, GREAT COLDNESS, GREAT SILENCE, AND A
PROFESSED RESOLUTION OF DOING NOTHING FOR HIS DAUGHTER.  HE THOUGHT IT
A VERY DEGRADING ALLIANCE; AND LADY RUSSELL, THOUGH WITH MORE TEMPERED
AND PARDONABLE PRIDE, RECEIVED IT AS A MOST UNFORTUNATE ONE.

ANNE ELLIOT, WITH ALL HER CLAIMS OF BIRTH, BEAUTY, AND MIND, TO THROW
HERSELF AWAY AT NINETEEN; INVOLVE HERSELF AT NINETEEN IN AN ENGAGEMENT
WITH A YOUNG MAN, WHO HAD NOTHING BUT HIMSELF TO RECOMMEND HIM, AND NO
HOPES OF ATTAINING AFFLUENCE, BUT IN THE CHANCES OF A MOST UNCERTAIN
PROFESSION, AND NO CONNEXIONS TO SECURE EVEN HIS FARTHER RISE IN THE
PROFESSION, WOULD BE, INDEED, A THROWING AWAY, WHICH SHE GRIEVED TO
THINK OF!  ANNE ELLIOT, SO YOUNG; KNOWN TO SO FEW, TO BE SNATCHED OFF
BY A STRANGER WITHOUT ALLIANCE OR FORTUNE; OR RATHER SUNK BY HIM INTO A
STATE OF MOST WEARING, ANXIOUS, YOUTH-KILLING DEPENDENCE!  IT MUST NOT
BE, IF BY ANY FAIR INTERFERENCE OF FRIENDSHIP, ANY REPRESENTATIONS FROM
ONE WHO HAD ALMOST A MOTHER'S LOVE, AND MOTHER'S RIGHTS, IT WOULD BE
PREVENTED.

CAPTAIN WENTWORTH HAD NO FORTUNE.  HE HAD BEEN LUCKY IN HIS PROFESSION;
BUT SPENDING FREELY, WHAT HAD COME FREELY, HAD REALIZED NOTHING.  BUT
HE WAS CONFIDENT THAT HE SHOULD SOON BE RICH: FULL OF LIFE AND ARDOUR,
HE KNEW THAT HE SHOULD SOON HAVE A SHIP, AND SOON BE ON A STATION THAT
WOULD LEAD TO EVERYTHING HE WANTED.  HE HAD ALWAYS BEEN LUCKY; HE KNEW
HE SHOULD BE SO STILL.  SUCH CONFIDENCE, POWERFUL IN ITS OWN WARMTH,
AND BEWITCHING IN THE WIT WHICH OFTEN EXPRESSED IT, MUST HAVE BEEN
ENOUGH FOR ANNE; BUT LADY RUSSELL SAW IT VERY DIFFERENTLY.  HIS
SANGUINE TEMPER, AND FEARLESSNESS OF MIND, OPERATED VERY DIFFERENTLY ON
HER.  SHE SAW IN IT BUT AN AGGRAVATION OF THE EVIL.  IT ONLY ADDED A
DANGEROUS CHARACTER TO HIMSELF.  HE WAS BRILLIANT, HE WAS HEADSTRONG.
LADY RUSSELL HAD LITTLE TASTE FOR WIT, AND OF ANYTHING APPROACHING TO
IMPRUDENCE A HORROR.  SHE DEPRECATED THE CONNEXION IN EVERY LIGHT.

SUCH OPPOSITION, AS THESE FEELINGS PRODUCED, WAS MORE THAN ANNE COULD
COMBAT.  YOUNG AND GENTLE AS SHE WAS, IT MIGHT YET HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE
TO WITHSTAND HER FATHER'S ILL-WILL, THOUGH UNSOFTENED BY ONE KIND WORD
OR LOOK ON THE PART OF HER SISTER; BUT LADY RUSSELL, WHOM SHE HAD
ALWAYS LOVED AND RELIED ON, COULD NOT, WITH SUCH STEADINESS OF OPINION,
AND SUCH TENDERNESS OF MANNER, BE CONTINUALLY ADVISING HER IN VAIN.
SHE WAS PERSUADED TO BELIEVE THE ENGAGEMENT A WRONG THING:  INDISCREET,
IMPROPER, HARDLY CAPABLE OF SUCCESS, AND NOT DESERVING IT.  BUT IT WAS
NOT A MERELY SELFISH CAUTION, UNDER WHICH SHE ACTED, IN PUTTING AN END
TO IT.  HAD SHE NOT IMAGINED HERSELF CONSULTING HIS GOOD, EVEN MORE
THAN HER OWN, SHE COULD HARDLY HAVE GIVEN HIM UP.  THE BELIEF OF BEING
PRUDENT, AND SELF-DENYING, PRINCIPALLY FOR HIS ADVANTAGE, WAS HER CHIEF
CONSOLATION, UNDER THE MISERY OF A PARTING, A FINAL PARTING; AND EVERY
CONSOLATION WAS REQUIRED, FOR SHE HAD TO ENCOUNTER ALL THE ADDITIONAL
PAIN OF OPINIONS, ON HIS SIDE, TOTALLY UNCONVINCED AND UNBENDING, AND
OF HIS FEELING HIMSELF ILL USED BY SO FORCED A RELINQUISHMENT.  HE HAD
LEFT THE COUNTRY IN CONSEQUENCE.

A FEW MONTHS HAD SEEN THE BEGINNING AND THE END OF THEIR ACQUAINTANCE;
BUT NOT WITH A FEW MONTHS ENDED ANNE'S SHARE OF SUFFERING FROM IT.  HER
ATTACHMENT AND REGRETS HAD, FOR A LONG TIME, CLOUDED EVERY ENJOYMENT OF
YOUTH, AND AN EARLY LOSS OF BLOOM AND SPIRITS HAD BEEN THEIR LASTING
EFFECT.

MORE THAN SEVEN YEARS WERE GONE SINCE THIS LITTLE HISTORY OF SORROWFUL
INTEREST HAD REACHED ITS CLOSE; AND TIME HAD SOFTENED DOWN MUCH,
PERHAPS NEARLY ALL OF PECULIAR ATTACHMENT TO HIM, BUT SHE HAD BEEN TOO
DEPENDENT ON TIME ALONE; NO AID HAD BEEN GIVEN IN CHANGE OF PLACE
(EXCEPT IN ONE VISIT TO BATH SOON AFTER THE RUPTURE), OR IN ANY NOVELTY
OR ENLARGEMENT OF SOCIETY.  NO ONE HAD EVER COME WITHIN THE KELLYNCH
CIRCLE, WHO COULD BEAR A COMPARISON WITH FREDERICK WENTWORTH, AS HE
STOOD IN HER MEMORY.  NO SECOND ATTACHMENT, THE ONLY THOROUGHLY
NATURAL, HAPPY, AND SUFFICIENT CURE, AT HER TIME OF LIFE, HAD BEEN
POSSIBLE TO THE NICE TONE OF HER MIND, THE FASTIDIOUSNESS OF HER TASTE,
IN THE SMALL LIMITS OF THE SOCIETY AROUND THEM.  SHE HAD BEEN
SOLICITED, WHEN ABOUT TWO-AND-TWENTY, TO CHANGE HER NAME, BY THE YOUNG
MAN, WHO NOT LONG AFTERWARDS FOUND A MORE WILLING MIND IN HER YOUNGER
SISTER; AND LADY RUSSELL HAD LAMENTED HER REFUSAL; FOR CHARLES MUSGROVE
WAS THE ELDEST SON OF A MAN, WHOSE LANDED PROPERTY AND GENERAL
IMPORTANCE WERE SECOND IN THAT COUNTRY, ONLY TO SIR WALTER'S, AND OF
GOOD CHARACTER AND APPEARANCE; AND HOWEVER LADY RUSSELL MIGHT HAVE
ASKED YET FOR SOMETHING MORE, WHILE ANNE WAS NINETEEN, SHE WOULD HAVE
REJOICED TO SEE HER AT TWENTY-TWO SO RESPECTABLY REMOVED FROM THE
PARTIALITIES AND INJUSTICE OF HER FATHER'S HOUSE, AND SETTLED SO
PERMANENTLY NEAR HERSELF.  BUT IN THIS CASE, ANNE HAD LEFT NOTHING FOR
ADVICE TO DO; AND THOUGH LADY RUSSELL, AS SATISFIED AS EVER WITH HER
OWN DISCRETION, NEVER WISHED THE PAST UNDONE, SHE BEGAN NOW TO HAVE THE
ANXIETY WHICH BORDERS ON HOPELESSNESS FOR ANNE'S BEING TEMPTED, BY SOME
MAN OF TALENTS AND INDEPENDENCE, TO ENTER A STATE FOR WHICH SHE HELD
HER TO BE PECULIARLY FITTED BY HER WARM AFFECTIONS AND DOMESTIC HABITS.

THEY KNEW NOT EACH OTHER'S OPINION, EITHER ITS CONSTANCY OR ITS CHANGE,
ON THE ONE LEADING POINT OF ANNE'S CONDUCT, FOR THE SUBJECT WAS NEVER
ALLUDED TO; BUT ANNE, AT SEVEN-AND-TWENTY, THOUGHT VERY DIFFERENTLY
FROM WHAT SHE HAD BEEN MADE TO THINK AT NINETEEN.  SHE DID NOT BLAME
LADY RUSSELL, SHE DID NOT BLAME HERSELF FOR HAVING BEEN GUIDED BY HER;
BUT SHE FELT THAT WERE ANY YOUNG PERSON, IN SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES, TO
APPLY TO HER FOR COUNSEL, THEY WOULD NEVER RECEIVE ANY OF SUCH CERTAIN
IMMEDIATE WRETCHEDNESS, SUCH UNCERTAIN FUTURE GOOD.  SHE WAS PERSUADED
THAT UNDER EVERY DISADVANTAGE OF DISAPPROBATION AT HOME, AND EVERY
ANXIETY ATTENDING HIS PROFESSION, ALL THEIR PROBABLE FEARS, DELAYS, AND
DISAPPOINTMENTS, SHE SHOULD YET HAVE BEEN A HAPPIER WOMAN IN
MAINTAINING THE ENGAGEMENT, THAN SHE HAD BEEN IN THE SACRIFICE OF IT;
AND THIS, SHE FULLY BELIEVED, HAD THE USUAL SHARE, HAD EVEN MORE THAN
THE USUAL SHARE OF ALL SUCH SOLICITUDES AND SUSPENSE BEEN THEIRS,
WITHOUT REFERENCE TO THE ACTUAL RESULTS OF THEIR CASE, WHICH, AS IT
HAPPENED, WOULD HAVE BESTOWED EARLIER PROSPERITY THAN COULD BE
REASONABLY CALCULATED ON.  ALL HIS SANGUINE EXPECTATIONS, ALL HIS
CONFIDENCE HAD BEEN JUSTIFIED.  HIS GENIUS AND ARDOUR HAD SEEMED TO
FORESEE AND TO COMMAND HIS PROSPEROUS PATH.  HE HAD, VERY SOON AFTER
THEIR ENGAGEMENT CEASED, GOT EMPLOY: AND ALL THAT HE HAD TOLD HER WOULD
FOLLOW, HAD TAKEN PLACE.  HE HAD DISTINGUISHED HIMSELF, AND EARLY
GAINED THE OTHER STEP IN RANK, AND MUST NOW, BY SUCCESSIVE CAPTURES,
HAVE MADE A HANDSOME FORTUNE.  SHE HAD ONLY NAVY LISTS AND NEWSPAPERS
FOR HER AUTHORITY, BUT SHE COULD NOT DOUBT HIS BEING RICH; AND, IN
FAVOUR OF HIS CONSTANCY, SHE HAD NO REASON TO BELIEVE HIM MARRIED.

HOW ELOQUENT COULD ANNE ELLIOT HAVE BEEN! HOW ELOQUENT, AT LEAST, WERE
HER WISHES ON THE SIDE OF EARLY WARM ATTACHMENT, AND A CHEERFUL
CONFIDENCE IN FUTURITY, AGAINST THAT OVER-ANXIOUS CAUTION WHICH SEEMS
TO INSULT EXERTION AND DISTRUST PROVIDENCE!  SHE HAD BEEN FORCED INTO
PRUDENCE IN HER YOUTH, SHE LEARNED ROMANCE AS SHE GREW OLDER: THE
NATURAL SEQUEL OF AN UNNATURAL BEGINNING.

WITH ALL THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, RECOLLECTIONS AND FEELINGS, SHE COULD NOT
HEAR THAT CAPTAIN WENTWORTH'S SISTER WAS LIKELY TO LIVE AT KELLYNCH
WITHOUT A REVIVAL OF FORMER PAIN; AND MANY A STROLL, AND MANY A SIGH,
WERE NECESSARY TO DISPEL THE AGITATION OF THE IDEA.  SHE OFTEN TOLD
HERSELF IT WAS FOLLY, BEFORE SHE COULD HARDEN HER NERVES SUFFICIENTLY
TO FEEL THE CONTINUAL DISCUSSION OF THE CROFTS AND THEIR BUSINESS NO
EVIL.  SHE WAS ASSISTED, HOWEVER, BY THAT PERFECT INDIFFERENCE AND
APPARENT UNCONSCIOUSNESS, AMONG THE ONLY THREE OF HER OWN FRIENDS IN
THE SECRET OF THE PAST, WHICH SEEMED ALMOST TO DENY ANY RECOLLECTION OF
IT.  SHE COULD DO JUSTICE TO THE SUPERIORITY OF LADY RUSSELL'S MOTIVES
IN THIS, OVER THOSE OF HER FATHER AND ELIZABETH; SHE COULD HONOUR ALL
THE BETTER FEELINGS OF HER CALMNESS; BUT THE GENERAL AIR OF OBLIVION
AMONG THEM WAS HIGHLY IMPORTANT FROM WHATEVER IT SPRUNG; AND IN THE
EVENT OF ADMIRAL CROFT'S REALLY TAKING KELLYNCH HALL, SHE REJOICED ANEW
OVER THE CONVICTION WHICH HAD ALWAYS BEEN MOST GRATEFUL TO HER, OF THE
PAST BEING KNOWN TO THOSE THREE ONLY AMONG HER CONNEXIONS, BY WHOM NO
SYLLABLE, SHE BELIEVED, WOULD EVER BE WHISPERED, AND IN THE TRUST THAT
AMONG HIS, THE BROTHER ONLY WITH WHOM HE HAD BEEN RESIDING, HAD
RECEIVED ANY INFORMATION OF THEIR SHORT-LIVED ENGAGEMENT.  THAT BROTHER
HAD BEEN LONG REMOVED FROM THE COUNTRY AND BEING A SENSIBLE MAN, AND,
MOREOVER, A SINGLE MAN AT THE TIME, SHE HAD A FOND DEPENDENCE ON NO
HUMAN CREATURE'S HAVING HEARD OF IT FROM HIM.

THE SISTER, MRS CROFT, HAD THEN BEEN OUT OF ENGLAND, ACCOMPANYING HER
HUSBAND ON A FOREIGN STATION, AND HER OWN SISTER, MARY, HAD BEEN AT
SCHOOL WHILE IT ALL OCCURRED; AND NEVER ADMITTED BY THE PRIDE OF SOME,
AND THE DELICACY OF OTHERS, TO THE SMALLEST KNOWLEDGE OF IT AFTERWARDS.

WITH THESE SUPPORTS, SHE HOPED THAT THE ACQUAINTANCE BETWEEN HERSELF
AND THE CROFTS, WHICH, WITH LADY RUSSELL, STILL RESIDENT IN KELLYNCH,
AND MARY FIXED ONLY THREE MILES OFF, MUST BE ANTICIPATED, NEED NOT
INVOLVE ANY PARTICULAR AWKWARDNESS.



CHAPTER 5


ON THE MORNING APPOINTED FOR ADMIRAL AND MRS CROFT'S SEEING KELLYNCH
HALL, ANNE FOUND IT MOST NATURAL TO TAKE HER ALMOST DAILY WALK TO LADY
RUSSELL'S, AND KEEP OUT OF THE WAY TILL ALL WAS OVER; WHEN SHE FOUND IT
MOST NATURAL TO BE SORRY THAT SHE HAD MISSED THE OPPORTUNITY OF SEEING
THEM.

THIS MEETING OF THE TWO PARTIES PROVED HIGHLY SATISFACTORY, AND DECIDED
THE WHOLE BUSINESS AT ONCE.  EACH LADY WAS PREVIOUSLY WELL DISPOSED FOR
AN AGREEMENT, AND SAW NOTHING, THEREFORE, BUT GOOD MANNERS IN THE
OTHER; AND WITH REGARD TO THE GENTLEMEN, THERE WAS SUCH AN HEARTY GOOD
HUMOUR, SUCH AN OPEN, TRUSTING LIBERALITY ON THE ADMIRAL'S SIDE, AS
COULD NOT BUT INFLUENCE SIR WALTER, WHO HAD BESIDES BEEN FLATTERED INTO
HIS VERY BEST AND MOST POLISHED BEHAVIOUR BY MR SHEPHERD'S ASSURANCES
OF HIS BEING KNOWN, BY REPORT, TO THE ADMIRAL, AS A MODEL OF GOOD
BREEDING.

THE HOUSE AND GROUNDS, AND FURNITURE, WERE APPROVED, THE CROFTS WERE
APPROVED, TERMS, TIME, EVERY THING, AND EVERY BODY, WAS RIGHT; AND MR
SHEPHERD'S CLERKS WERE SET TO WORK, WITHOUT THERE HAVING BEEN A SINGLE
PRELIMINARY DIFFERENCE TO MODIFY OF ALL THAT "THIS INDENTURE SHEWETH."

SIR WALTER, WITHOUT HESITATION, DECLARED THE ADMIRAL TO BE THE
BEST-LOOKING SAILOR HE HAD EVER MET WITH, AND WENT SO FAR AS TO SAY,
THAT IF HIS OWN MAN MIGHT HAVE HAD THE ARRANGING OF HIS HAIR, HE SHOULD
NOT BE ASHAMED OF BEING SEEN WITH HIM ANY WHERE; AND THE ADMIRAL, WITH
SYMPATHETIC CORDIALITY, OBSERVED TO HIS WIFE AS THEY DROVE BACK THROUGH
THE PARK, "I THOUGHT WE SHOULD SOON COME TO A DEAL, MY DEAR, IN SPITE
OF WHAT THEY TOLD US AT TAUNTON.  THE BARONET WILL NEVER SET THE THAMES
ON FIRE, BUT THERE SEEMS TO BE NO HARM IN HIM."--RECIPROCAL
COMPLIMENTS, WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN ESTEEMED ABOUT EQUAL.

THE CROFTS WERE TO HAVE POSSESSION AT MICHAELMAS; AND AS SIR WALTER
PROPOSED REMOVING TO BATH IN THE COURSE OF THE PRECEDING MONTH, THERE
WAS NO TIME TO BE LOST IN MAKING EVERY DEPENDENT ARRANGEMENT.

LADY RUSSELL, CONVINCED THAT ANNE WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO BE OF ANY
USE, OR ANY IMPORTANCE, IN THE CHOICE OF THE HOUSE WHICH THEY WERE
GOING TO SECURE, WAS VERY UNWILLING TO HAVE HER HURRIED AWAY SO SOON,
AND WANTED TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR HER TO STAY BEHIND TILL SHE MIGHT
CONVEY HER TO BATH HERSELF AFTER CHRISTMAS; BUT HAVING ENGAGEMENTS OF
HER OWN WHICH MUST TAKE HER FROM KELLYNCH FOR SEVERAL WEEKS, SHE WAS
UNABLE TO GIVE THE FULL INVITATION SHE WISHED, AND ANNE THOUGH DREADING
THE POSSIBLE HEATS OF SEPTEMBER IN ALL THE WHITE GLARE OF BATH, AND
GRIEVING TO FOREGO ALL THE INFLUENCE SO SWEET AND SO SAD OF THE
AUTUMNAL MONTHS IN THE COUNTRY, DID NOT THINK THAT, EVERYTHING
CONSIDERED, SHE WISHED TO REMAIN.  IT WOULD BE MOST RIGHT, AND MOST
WISE, AND, THEREFORE MUST INVOLVE LEAST SUFFERING TO GO WITH THE OTHERS.

SOMETHING OCCURRED, HOWEVER, TO GIVE HER A DIFFERENT DUTY.  MARY, OFTEN
A LITTLE UNWELL, AND ALWAYS THINKING A GREAT DEAL OF HER OWN
COMPLAINTS, AND ALWAYS IN THE HABIT OF CLAIMING ANNE WHEN ANYTHING WAS
THE MATTER, WAS INDISPOSED; AND FORESEEING THAT SHE SHOULD NOT HAVE A
DAY'S HEALTH ALL THE AUTUMN, ENTREATED, OR RATHER REQUIRED HER, FOR IT
WAS HARDLY ENTREATY, TO COME TO UPPERCROSS COTTAGE, AND BEAR HER
COMPANY AS LONG AS SHE SHOULD WANT HER, INSTEAD OF GOING TO BATH.

"I CANNOT POSSIBLY DO WITHOUT ANNE," WAS MARY'S REASONING; AND
ELIZABETH'S REPLY WAS, "THEN I AM SURE ANNE HAD BETTER STAY, FOR NOBODY
WILL WANT HER IN BATH."

TO BE CLAIMED AS A GOOD, THOUGH IN AN IMPROPER STYLE, IS AT LEAST
BETTER THAN BEING REJECTED AS NO GOOD AT ALL; AND ANNE, GLAD TO BE
THOUGHT OF SOME USE, GLAD TO HAVE ANYTHING MARKED OUT AS A DUTY, AND
CERTAINLY NOT SORRY TO HAVE THE SCENE OF IT IN THE COUNTRY, AND HER OWN
DEAR COUNTRY, READILY AGREED TO STAY.

THIS INVITATION OF MARY'S REMOVED ALL LADY RUSSELL'S DIFFICULTIES, AND
IT WAS CONSEQUENTLY SOON SETTLED THAT ANNE SHOULD NOT GO TO BATH TILL
LADY RUSSELL TOOK HER, AND THAT ALL THE INTERVENING TIME SHOULD BE
DIVIDED BETWEEN UPPERCROSS COTTAGE AND KELLYNCH LODGE.

SO FAR ALL WAS PERFECTLY RIGHT; BUT LADY RUSSELL WAS ALMOST STARTLED BY
THE WRONG OF ONE PART OF THE KELLYNCH HALL PLAN, WHEN IT BURST ON HER,
WHICH WAS, MRS CLAY'S BEING ENGAGED TO GO TO BATH WITH SIR WALTER AND
ELIZABETH, AS A MOST IMPORTANT AND VALUABLE ASSISTANT TO THE LATTER IN
ALL THE BUSINESS BEFORE HER.  LADY RUSSELL WAS EXTREMELY SORRY THAT
SUCH A MEASURE SHOULD HAVE BEEN RESORTED TO AT ALL, WONDERED, GRIEVED,
AND FEARED; AND THE AFFRONT IT CONTAINED TO ANNE, IN MRS CLAY'S BEING
OF SO MUCH USE, WHILE ANNE COULD BE OF NONE, WAS A VERY SORE
AGGRAVATION.

ANNE HERSELF WAS BECOME HARDENED TO SUCH AFFRONTS; BUT SHE FELT THE
IMPRUDENCE OF THE ARRANGEMENT QUITE AS KEENLY AS LADY RUSSELL.  WITH A
GREAT DEAL OF QUIET OBSERVATION, AND A KNOWLEDGE, WHICH SHE OFTEN
WISHED LESS, OF HER FATHER'S CHARACTER, SHE WAS SENSIBLE THAT RESULTS
THE MOST SERIOUS TO HIS FAMILY FROM THE INTIMACY WERE MORE THAN
POSSIBLE.  SHE DID NOT IMAGINE THAT HER FATHER HAD AT PRESENT AN IDEA
OF THE KIND.  MRS CLAY HAD FRECKLES, AND A PROJECTING TOOTH, AND A
CLUMSY WRIST, WHICH HE WAS CONTINUALLY MAKING SEVERE REMARKS UPON, IN
HER ABSENCE; BUT SHE WAS YOUNG, AND CERTAINLY ALTOGETHER WELL-LOOKING,
AND POSSESSED, IN AN ACUTE MIND AND ASSIDUOUS PLEASING MANNERS,
INFINITELY MORE DANGEROUS ATTRACTIONS THAN ANY MERELY PERSONAL MIGHT
HAVE BEEN.  ANNE WAS SO IMPRESSED BY THE DEGREE OF THEIR DANGER, THAT
SHE COULD NOT EXCUSE HERSELF FROM TRYING TO MAKE IT PERCEPTIBLE TO HER
SISTER.  SHE HAD LITTLE HOPE OF SUCCESS; BUT ELIZABETH, WHO IN THE
EVENT OF SUCH A REVERSE WOULD BE SO MUCH MORE TO BE PITIED THAN
HERSELF, SHOULD NEVER, SHE THOUGHT, HAVE REASON TO REPROACH HER FOR
GIVING NO WARNING.

SHE SPOKE, AND SEEMED ONLY TO OFFEND.  ELIZABETH COULD NOT CONCEIVE HOW
SUCH AN ABSURD SUSPICION SHOULD OCCUR TO HER, AND INDIGNANTLY ANSWERED
FOR EACH PARTY'S PERFECTLY KNOWING THEIR SITUATION.

"MRS CLAY," SAID SHE, WARMLY, "NEVER FORGETS WHO SHE IS; AND AS I AM
RATHER BETTER ACQUAINTED WITH HER SENTIMENTS THAN YOU CAN BE, I CAN
ASSURE YOU, THAT UPON THE SUBJECT OF MARRIAGE THEY ARE PARTICULARLY
NICE, AND THAT SHE REPROBATES ALL INEQUALITY OF CONDITION AND RANK MORE
STRONGLY THAN MOST PEOPLE.  AND AS TO MY FATHER, I REALLY SHOULD NOT
HAVE THOUGHT THAT HE, WHO HAS KEPT HIMSELF SINGLE SO LONG FOR OUR
SAKES, NEED BE SUSPECTED NOW.  IF MRS CLAY WERE A VERY BEAUTIFUL WOMAN,
I GRANT YOU, IT MIGHT BE WRONG TO HAVE HER SO MUCH WITH ME; NOT THAT
ANYTHING IN THE WORLD, I AM SURE, WOULD INDUCE MY FATHER TO MAKE A
DEGRADING MATCH, BUT HE MIGHT BE RENDERED UNHAPPY.  BUT POOR MRS CLAY
WHO, WITH ALL HER MERITS, CAN NEVER HAVE BEEN RECKONED TOLERABLY
PRETTY, I REALLY THINK POOR MRS CLAY MAY BE STAYING HERE IN PERFECT
SAFETY.  ONE WOULD IMAGINE YOU HAD NEVER HEARD MY FATHER SPEAK OF HER
PERSONAL MISFORTUNES, THOUGH I KNOW YOU MUST FIFTY TIMES.  THAT TOOTH
OF HER'S AND THOSE FRECKLES.  FRECKLES DO NOT DISGUST ME SO VERY MUCH
AS THEY DO HIM.  I HAVE KNOWN A FACE NOT MATERIALLY DISFIGURED BY A
FEW, BUT HE ABOMINATES THEM.  YOU MUST HAVE HEARD HIM NOTICE MRS CLAY'S
FRECKLES."

"THERE IS HARDLY ANY PERSONAL DEFECT," REPLIED ANNE, "WHICH AN
AGREEABLE MANNER MIGHT NOT GRADUALLY RECONCILE ONE TO."

"I THINK VERY DIFFERENTLY," ANSWERED ELIZABETH, SHORTLY; "AN AGREEABLE
MANNER MAY SET OFF HANDSOME FEATURES, BUT CAN NEVER ALTER PLAIN ONES.
HOWEVER, AT ANY RATE, AS I HAVE A GREAT DEAL MORE AT STAKE ON THIS
POINT THAN ANYBODY ELSE CAN HAVE, I THINK IT RATHER UNNECESSARY IN YOU
TO BE ADVISING ME."

ANNE HAD DONE; GLAD THAT IT WAS OVER, AND NOT ABSOLUTELY HOPELESS OF
DOING GOOD.  ELIZABETH, THOUGH RESENTING THE SUSPICION, MIGHT YET BE
MADE OBSERVANT BY IT.

THE LAST OFFICE OF THE FOUR CARRIAGE-HORSES WAS TO DRAW SIR WALTER,
MISS ELLIOT, AND MRS CLAY TO BATH. THE PARTY DROVE OFF IN VERY GOOD
SPIRITS; SIR WALTER PREPARED WITH CONDESCENDING BOWS FOR ALL THE
AFFLICTED TENANTRY AND COTTAGERS WHO MIGHT HAVE HAD A HINT TO SHOW
THEMSELVES, AND ANNE WALKED UP AT THE SAME TIME, IN A SORT OF DESOLATE
TRANQUILLITY, TO THE LODGE, WHERE SHE WAS TO SPEND THE FIRST WEEK.

HER FRIEND WAS NOT IN BETTER SPIRITS THAN HERSELF. LADY RUSSELL FELT
THIS BREAK-UP OF THE FAMILY EXCEEDINGLY.  THEIR RESPECTABILITY WAS AS
DEAR TO HER AS HER OWN, AND A DAILY INTERCOURSE HAD BECOME PRECIOUS BY
HABIT.  IT WAS PAINFUL TO LOOK UPON THEIR DESERTED GROUNDS, AND STILL
WORSE TO ANTICIPATE THE NEW HANDS THEY WERE TO FALL INTO; AND TO ESCAPE
THE SOLITARINESS AND THE MELANCHOLY OF SO ALTERED A VILLAGE, AND BE OUT
OF THE WAY WHEN ADMIRAL AND MRS CROFT FIRST ARRIVED, SHE HAD DETERMINED
TO MAKE HER OWN ABSENCE FROM HOME BEGIN WHEN SHE MUST GIVE UP ANNE.
ACCORDINGLY THEIR REMOVAL WAS MADE TOGETHER, AND ANNE WAS SET DOWN AT
UPPERCROSS COTTAGE, IN THE FIRST STAGE OF LADY RUSSELL'S JOURNEY.

UPPERCROSS WAS A MODERATE-SIZED VILLAGE, WHICH A FEW YEARS BACK HAD
BEEN COMPLETELY IN THE OLD ENGLISH STYLE, CONTAINING ONLY TWO HOUSES
SUPERIOR IN APPEARANCE TO THOSE OF THE YEOMEN AND LABOURERS; THE
MANSION OF THE SQUIRE, WITH ITS HIGH WALLS, GREAT GATES, AND OLD TREES,
SUBSTANTIAL AND UNMODERNIZED, AND THE COMPACT, TIGHT PARSONAGE,
ENCLOSED IN ITS OWN NEAT GARDEN, WITH A VINE AND A PEAR-TREE TRAINED
ROUND ITS CASEMENTS; BUT UPON THE MARRIAGE OF THE YOUNG 'SQUIRE, IT HAD
RECEIVED THE IMPROVEMENT OF A FARM-HOUSE ELEVATED INTO A COTTAGE, FOR
HIS RESIDENCE, AND UPPERCROSS COTTAGE, WITH ITS VERANDA, FRENCH
WINDOWS, AND OTHER PRETTINESS, WAS QUITE AS LIKELY TO CATCH THE
TRAVELLER'S EYE AS THE MORE CONSISTENT AND CONSIDERABLE ASPECT AND
PREMISES OF THE GREAT HOUSE, ABOUT A QUARTER OF A MILE FARTHER ON.

HERE ANNE HAD OFTEN BEEN STAYING. SHE KNEW THE WAYS OF UPPERCROSS AS
WELL AS THOSE OF KELLYNCH. THE TWO FAMILIES WERE SO CONTINUALLY
MEETING, SO MUCH IN THE HABIT OF RUNNING IN AND OUT OF EACH OTHER'S
HOUSE AT ALL HOURS, THAT IT WAS RATHER A SURPRISE TO HER TO FIND MARY
ALONE; BUT BEING ALONE, HER BEING UNWELL AND OUT OF SPIRITS WAS ALMOST
A MATTER OF COURSE. THOUGH BETTER ENDOWED THAN THE ELDER SISTER, MARY
HAD NOT ANNE'S UNDERSTANDING NOR TEMPER. WHILE WELL, AND HAPPY, AND
PROPERLY ATTENDED TO, SHE HAD GREAT GOOD HUMOUR AND EXCELLENT SPIRITS;
BUT ANY INDISPOSITION SUNK HER COMPLETELY. SHE HAD NO RESOURCES FOR
SOLITUDE; AND INHERITING A CONSIDERABLE SHARE OF THE ELLIOT
SELF-IMPORTANCE, WAS VERY PRONE TO ADD TO EVERY OTHER DISTRESS THAT OF
FANCYING HERSELF NEGLECTED AND ILL-USED. IN PERSON, SHE WAS INFERIOR TO
BOTH SISTERS, AND HAD, EVEN IN HER BLOOM, ONLY REACHED THE DIGNITY OF
BEING "A FINE GIRL." SHE WAS NOW LYING ON THE FADED SOFA OF THE PRETTY
LITTLE DRAWING-ROOM, THE ONCE ELEGANT FURNITURE OF WHICH HAD BEEN
GRADUALLY GROWING SHABBY, UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF FOUR SUMMERS AND TWO
CHILDREN; AND, ON ANNE'S APPEARING, GREETED HER WITH--

"SO, YOU ARE COME AT LAST!  I BEGAN TO THINK I SHOULD NEVER SEE YOU.  I
AM SO ILL I CAN HARDLY SPEAK.  I HAVE NOT SEEN A CREATURE THE WHOLE
MORNING!"

"I AM SORRY TO FIND YOU UNWELL," REPLIED ANNE.  "YOU SENT ME SUCH A
GOOD ACCOUNT OF YOURSELF ON THURSDAY!"

"YES, I MADE THE BEST OF IT; I ALWAYS DO:  BUT I WAS VERY FAR FROM WELL
AT THE TIME; AND I DO NOT THINK I EVER WAS SO ILL IN MY LIFE AS I HAVE
BEEN ALL THIS MORNING:  VERY UNFIT TO BE LEFT ALONE, I AM SURE.
SUPPOSE I WERE TO BE SEIZED OF A SUDDEN IN SOME DREADFUL WAY, AND NOT
ABLE TO RING THE BELL!  SO, LADY RUSSELL WOULD NOT GET OUT.  I DO NOT
THINK SHE HAS BEEN IN THIS HOUSE THREE TIMES THIS SUMMER."

ANNE SAID WHAT WAS PROPER, AND ENQUIRED AFTER HER HUSBAND.  "OH!
CHARLES IS OUT SHOOTING.  I HAVE NOT SEEN HIM SINCE SEVEN O'CLOCK.  HE
WOULD GO, THOUGH I TOLD HIM HOW ILL I WAS.  HE SAID HE SHOULD NOT STAY
OUT LONG; BUT HE HAS NEVER COME BACK, AND NOW IT IS ALMOST ONE.  I
ASSURE YOU, I HAVE NOT SEEN A SOUL THIS WHOLE LONG MORNING."

"YOU HAVE HAD YOUR LITTLE BOYS WITH YOU?"

"YES, AS LONG AS I COULD BEAR THEIR NOISE; BUT THEY ARE SO UNMANAGEABLE
THAT THEY DO ME MORE HARM THAN GOOD.  LITTLE CHARLES DOES NOT MIND A
WORD I SAY, AND WALTER IS GROWING QUITE AS BAD."

"WELL, YOU WILL SOON BE BETTER NOW," REPLIED ANNE, CHEERFULLY.  "YOU
KNOW I ALWAYS CURE YOU WHEN I COME.  HOW ARE YOUR NEIGHBOURS AT THE
GREAT HOUSE?"

"I CAN GIVE YOU NO ACCOUNT OF THEM.  I HAVE NOT SEEN ONE OF THEM
TO-DAY, EXCEPT MR MUSGROVE, WHO JUST STOPPED AND SPOKE THROUGH THE
WINDOW, BUT WITHOUT GETTING OFF HIS HORSE; AND THOUGH I TOLD HIM HOW
ILL I WAS, NOT ONE OF THEM HAVE BEEN NEAR ME.  IT DID NOT HAPPEN TO
SUIT THE MISS MUSGROVES, I SUPPOSE, AND THEY NEVER PUT THEMSELVES OUT
OF THEIR WAY."

"YOU WILL SEE THEM YET, PERHAPS, BEFORE THE MORNING IS GONE.  IT IS
EARLY."

"I NEVER WANT THEM, I ASSURE YOU.  THEY TALK AND LAUGH A GREAT DEAL TOO
MUCH FOR ME.  OH! ANNE, I AM SO VERY UNWELL!  IT WAS QUITE UNKIND OF
YOU NOT TO COME ON THURSDAY."

"MY DEAR MARY, RECOLLECT WHAT A COMFORTABLE ACCOUNT YOU SENT ME OF
YOURSELF!  YOU WROTE IN THE CHEERFULLEST MANNER, AND SAID YOU WERE
PERFECTLY WELL, AND IN NO HURRY FOR ME; AND THAT BEING THE CASE, YOU
MUST BE AWARE THAT MY WISH WOULD BE TO REMAIN WITH LADY RUSSELL TO THE
LAST: AND BESIDES WHAT I FELT ON HER ACCOUNT, I HAVE REALLY BEEN SO
BUSY, HAVE HAD SO MUCH TO DO, THAT I COULD NOT VERY CONVENIENTLY HAVE
LEFT KELLYNCH SOONER."

"DEAR ME! WHAT CAN YOU POSSIBLY HAVE TO DO?"

"A GREAT MANY THINGS, I ASSURE YOU.  MORE THAN I CAN RECOLLECT IN A
MOMENT; BUT I CAN TELL YOU SOME.  I HAVE BEEN MAKING A DUPLICATE OF THE
CATALOGUE OF MY FATHER'S BOOKS AND PICTURES.  I HAVE BEEN SEVERAL TIMES
IN THE GARDEN WITH MACKENZIE, TRYING TO UNDERSTAND, AND MAKE HIM
UNDERSTAND, WHICH OF ELIZABETH'S PLANTS ARE FOR LADY RUSSELL.  I HAVE
HAD ALL MY OWN LITTLE CONCERNS TO ARRANGE, BOOKS AND MUSIC TO DIVIDE,
AND ALL MY TRUNKS TO REPACK, FROM NOT HAVING UNDERSTOOD IN TIME WHAT
WAS INTENDED AS TO THE WAGGONS: AND ONE THING I HAVE HAD TO DO, MARY,
OF A MORE TRYING NATURE: GOING TO ALMOST EVERY HOUSE IN THE PARISH, AS
A SORT OF TAKE-LEAVE.  I WAS TOLD THAT THEY WISHED IT.  BUT ALL THESE
THINGS TOOK UP A GREAT DEAL OF TIME."

"OH! WELL!" AND AFTER A MOMENT'S PAUSE, "BUT YOU HAVE NEVER ASKED ME
ONE WORD ABOUT OUR DINNER AT THE POOLES YESTERDAY."

"DID YOU GO THEN?  I HAVE MADE NO ENQUIRIES, BECAUSE I CONCLUDED YOU
MUST HAVE BEEN OBLIGED TO GIVE UP THE PARTY."

"OH YES! I WENT.  I WAS VERY WELL YESTERDAY; NOTHING AT ALL THE MATTER
WITH ME TILL THIS MORNING.  IT WOULD HAVE BEEN STRANGE IF I HAD NOT
GONE."

"I AM VERY GLAD YOU WERE WELL ENOUGH, AND I HOPE YOU HAD A PLEASANT
PARTY."

"NOTHING REMARKABLE.  ONE ALWAYS KNOWS BEFOREHAND WHAT THE DINNER WILL
BE, AND WHO WILL BE THERE; AND IT IS SO VERY UNCOMFORTABLE NOT HAVING A
CARRIAGE OF ONE'S OWN.  MR AND MRS MUSGROVE TOOK ME, AND WE WERE SO
CROWDED!  THEY ARE BOTH SO VERY LARGE, AND TAKE UP SO MUCH ROOM; AND MR
MUSGROVE ALWAYS SITS FORWARD.  SO, THERE WAS I, CROWDED INTO THE BACK
SEAT WITH HENRIETTA AND LOUISE; AND I THINK IT VERY LIKELY THAT MY
ILLNESS TO-DAY MAY BE OWING TO IT."

A LITTLE FURTHER PERSEVERANCE IN PATIENCE AND FORCED CHEERFULNESS ON
ANNE'S SIDE PRODUCED NEARLY A CURE ON MARY'S.  SHE COULD SOON SIT
UPRIGHT ON THE SOFA, AND BEGAN TO HOPE SHE MIGHT BE ABLE TO LEAVE IT BY
DINNER-TIME.  THEN, FORGETTING TO THINK OF IT, SHE WAS AT THE OTHER END
OF THE ROOM, BEAUTIFYING A NOSEGAY; THEN, SHE ATE HER COLD MEAT; AND
THEN SHE WAS WELL ENOUGH TO PROPOSE A LITTLE WALK.

"WHERE SHALL WE GO?" SAID SHE, WHEN THEY WERE READY.  "I SUPPOSE YOU
WILL NOT LIKE TO CALL AT THE GREAT HOUSE BEFORE THEY HAVE BEEN TO SEE
YOU?"

"I HAVE NOT THE SMALLEST OBJECTION ON THAT ACCOUNT," REPLIED ANNE.  "I
SHOULD NEVER THINK OF STANDING ON SUCH CEREMONY WITH PEOPLE I KNOW SO
WELL AS MRS AND THE MISS MUSGROVES."

"OH! BUT THEY OUGHT TO CALL UPON YOU AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  THEY OUGHT
TO FEEL WHAT IS DUE TO YOU AS MY SISTER.  HOWEVER, WE MAY AS WELL GO
AND SIT WITH THEM A LITTLE  WHILE, AND WHEN WE HAVE THAT OVER, WE CAN
ENJOY OUR WALK."

ANNE HAD ALWAYS THOUGHT SUCH A STYLE OF INTERCOURSE HIGHLY IMPRUDENT;
BUT SHE HAD CEASED TO ENDEAVOUR TO CHECK IT, FROM BELIEVING THAT,
THOUGH THERE WERE ON EACH SIDE CONTINUAL SUBJECTS OF OFFENCE, NEITHER
FAMILY COULD NOW DO WITHOUT IT.  TO THE GREAT HOUSE ACCORDINGLY THEY
WENT, TO SIT THE FULL HALF HOUR IN THE OLD-FASHIONED SQUARE PARLOUR,
WITH A SMALL CARPET AND SHINING FLOOR, TO WHICH THE PRESENT DAUGHTERS
OF THE HOUSE WERE GRADUALLY GIVING THE PROPER AIR OF CONFUSION BY A
GRAND PIANO-FORTE AND A HARP, FLOWER-STANDS AND LITTLE TABLES PLACED IN
EVERY DIRECTION.  OH! COULD THE ORIGINALS OF THE PORTRAITS AGAINST THE
WAINSCOT, COULD THE GENTLEMEN IN BROWN VELVET AND THE LADIES IN BLUE
SATIN HAVE SEEN WHAT WAS GOING ON, HAVE BEEN CONSCIOUS OF SUCH AN
OVERTHROW OF ALL ORDER AND NEATNESS!  THE PORTRAITS THEMSELVES SEEMED
TO BE STARING IN ASTONISHMENT.

THE MUSGROVES, LIKE THEIR HOUSES, WERE IN A STATE OF ALTERATION,
PERHAPS OF IMPROVEMENT.  THE FATHER AND MOTHER WERE IN THE OLD ENGLISH
STYLE, AND THE YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE NEW.  MR AND MRS MUSGROVE WERE A
VERY GOOD SORT OF PEOPLE; FRIENDLY AND HOSPITABLE, NOT MUCH EDUCATED,
AND NOT AT ALL ELEGANT.  THEIR CHILDREN HAD MORE MODERN MINDS AND
MANNERS.  THERE WAS A NUMEROUS FAMILY; BUT THE ONLY TWO GROWN UP,
EXCEPTING CHARLES, WERE HENRIETTA AND LOUISA, YOUNG LADIES OF NINETEEN
AND TWENTY, WHO HAD BROUGHT FROM SCHOOL AT EXETER ALL THE USUAL STOCK
OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS, AND WERE NOW LIKE THOUSANDS OF OTHER YOUNG LADIES,
LIVING TO BE FASHIONABLE, HAPPY, AND MERRY.  THEIR DRESS HAD EVERY
ADVANTAGE, THEIR FACES WERE RATHER PRETTY, THEIR SPIRITS EXTREMELY
GOOD, THEIR MANNER UNEMBARRASSED AND PLEASANT; THEY WERE OF CONSEQUENCE
AT HOME, AND FAVOURITES ABROAD.  ANNE ALWAYS CONTEMPLATED THEM AS SOME
OF THE HAPPIEST CREATURES OF HER ACQUAINTANCE; BUT STILL, SAVED AS WE
ALL ARE, BY SOME COMFORTABLE FEELING OF SUPERIORITY FROM WISHING FOR
THE POSSIBILITY OF EXCHANGE, SHE WOULD NOT HAVE GIVEN UP HER OWN MORE
ELEGANT AND CULTIVATED MIND FOR ALL THEIR ENJOYMENTS; AND ENVIED THEM
NOTHING BUT THAT SEEMINGLY PERFECT GOOD UNDERSTANDING AND AGREEMENT
TOGETHER, THAT GOOD-HUMOURED MUTUAL AFFECTION, OF WHICH SHE HAD KNOWN
SO LITTLE HERSELF WITH EITHER OF HER SISTERS.

THEY WERE RECEIVED WITH GREAT CORDIALITY.  NOTHING SEEMED AMISS ON THE
SIDE OF THE GREAT HOUSE FAMILY, WHICH WAS GENERALLY, AS ANNE VERY WELL
KNEW, THE LEAST TO BLAME.  THE HALF HOUR WAS CHATTED AWAY PLEASANTLY
ENOUGH; AND SHE WAS NOT AT ALL SURPRISED AT THE END OF IT, TO HAVE
THEIR WALKING PARTY JOINED BY BOTH THE MISS MUSGROVES, AT MARY'S
PARTICULAR INVITATION.



CHAPTER 6


ANNE HAD NOT WANTED THIS VISIT TO UPPERCROSS, TO LEARN THAT A REMOVAL
FROM ONE SET OF PEOPLE TO ANOTHER, THOUGH AT A DISTANCE OF ONLY THREE
MILES, WILL OFTEN INCLUDE A TOTAL CHANGE OF CONVERSATION, OPINION, AND
IDEA.  SHE HAD NEVER BEEN STAYING THERE BEFORE, WITHOUT BEING STRUCK BY
IT, OR WITHOUT WISHING THAT OTHER ELLIOTS COULD HAVE HER ADVANTAGE IN
SEEING HOW UNKNOWN, OR UNCONSIDERED THERE, WERE THE AFFAIRS WHICH AT
KELLYNCH HALL WERE TREATED AS OF SUCH GENERAL PUBLICITY AND PERVADING
INTEREST; YET, WITH ALL THIS EXPERIENCE, SHE BELIEVED SHE MUST NOW
SUBMIT TO FEEL THAT ANOTHER LESSON, IN THE ART OF KNOWING OUR OWN
NOTHINGNESS BEYOND OUR OWN CIRCLE, WAS BECOME NECESSARY FOR HER; FOR
CERTAINLY, COMING AS SHE DID, WITH A HEART FULL OF THE SUBJECT WHICH
HAD BEEN COMPLETELY OCCUPYING BOTH HOUSES IN KELLYNCH FOR MANY WEEKS,
SHE HAD EXPECTED RATHER MORE CURIOSITY AND SYMPATHY THAN SHE FOUND IN
THE SEPARATE BUT VERY SIMILAR REMARK OF MR AND MRS MUSGROVE: "SO, MISS
ANNE, SIR WALTER AND YOUR SISTER ARE GONE; AND WHAT PART OF BATH DO YOU
THINK THEY WILL SETTLE IN?" AND THIS, WITHOUT MUCH WAITING FOR AN
ANSWER; OR IN THE YOUNG LADIES' ADDITION OF, "I HOPE WE SHALL BE IN
BATH IN THE WINTER; BUT REMEMBER, PAPA, IF WE DO GO, WE MUST BE IN A
GOOD SITUATION:  NONE OF YOUR QUEEN SQUARES FOR US!" OR IN THE ANXIOUS
SUPPLEMENT FROM MARY, OF--"UPON MY WORD, I SHALL BE PRETTY WELL OFF,
WHEN YOU ARE ALL GONE AWAY TO BE HAPPY AT BATH!"

SHE COULD ONLY RESOLVE TO AVOID SUCH SELF-DELUSION IN FUTURE, AND THINK
WITH HEIGHTENED GRATITUDE OF THE EXTRAORDINARY BLESSING OF HAVING ONE
SUCH TRULY SYMPATHISING FRIEND AS LADY RUSSELL.

THE MR MUSGROVES HAD THEIR OWN GAME TO GUARD, AND TO DESTROY, THEIR OWN
HORSES, DOGS, AND NEWSPAPERS TO ENGAGE THEM, AND THE FEMALES WERE FULLY
OCCUPIED IN ALL THE OTHER COMMON SUBJECTS OF HOUSEKEEPING, NEIGHBOURS,
DRESS, DANCING, AND MUSIC.  SHE ACKNOWLEDGED IT TO BE VERY FITTING,
THAT EVERY LITTLE SOCIAL COMMONWEALTH SHOULD DICTATE ITS OWN MATTERS OF
DISCOURSE; AND HOPED, ERE LONG, TO BECOME A NOT UNWORTHY MEMBER OF THE
ONE SHE WAS NOW TRANSPLANTED INTO.  WITH THE PROSPECT OF SPENDING AT
LEAST TWO MONTHS AT UPPERCROSS, IT WAS HIGHLY INCUMBENT ON HER TO
CLOTHE HER IMAGINATION, HER MEMORY, AND ALL HER IDEAS IN AS MUCH OF
UPPERCROSS AS POSSIBLE.

SHE HAD NO DREAD OF THESE TWO MONTHS.  MARY WAS NOT SO REPULSIVE AND
UNSISTERLY AS ELIZABETH, NOR SO INACCESSIBLE TO ALL INFLUENCE OF HERS;
NEITHER WAS THERE ANYTHING AMONG THE OTHER COMPONENT PARTS OF THE
COTTAGE INIMICAL TO COMFORT.  SHE WAS ALWAYS ON FRIENDLY TERMS WITH HER
BROTHER-IN-LAW; AND IN THE CHILDREN, WHO LOVED HER NEARLY AS WELL, AND
RESPECTED HER A GREAT DEAL MORE THAN THEIR MOTHER, SHE HAD AN OBJECT OF
INTEREST, AMUSEMENT, AND WHOLESOME EXERTION.

CHARLES MUSGROVE WAS CIVIL AND AGREEABLE; IN SENSE AND TEMPER HE WAS
UNDOUBTEDLY SUPERIOR TO HIS WIFE, BUT NOT OF POWERS, OR CONVERSATION,
OR GRACE, TO MAKE THE PAST, AS THEY WERE CONNECTED TOGETHER, AT ALL A
DANGEROUS CONTEMPLATION; THOUGH, AT THE SAME TIME, ANNE COULD BELIEVE,
WITH LADY RUSSELL, THAT A MORE EQUAL MATCH MIGHT HAVE GREATLY IMPROVED
HIM; AND THAT A WOMAN OF REAL UNDERSTANDING MIGHT HAVE GIVEN MORE
CONSEQUENCE TO HIS CHARACTER, AND MORE USEFULNESS, RATIONALITY, AND
ELEGANCE TO HIS HABITS AND PURSUITS.  AS IT WAS, HE DID NOTHING WITH
MUCH ZEAL, BUT SPORT; AND HIS TIME WAS OTHERWISE TRIFLED AWAY, WITHOUT
BENEFIT FROM BOOKS OR ANYTHING ELSE.  HE HAD VERY GOOD SPIRITS, WHICH
NEVER SEEMED MUCH AFFECTED BY HIS WIFE'S OCCASIONAL LOWNESS, BORE WITH
HER UNREASONABLENESS SOMETIMES TO ANNE'S ADMIRATION, AND UPON THE
WHOLE, THOUGH THERE WAS VERY OFTEN A LITTLE DISAGREEMENT (IN WHICH SHE
HAD SOMETIMES MORE SHARE THAN SHE WISHED, BEING APPEALED TO BY BOTH
PARTIES), THEY MIGHT PASS FOR A HAPPY COUPLE.  THEY WERE ALWAYS
PERFECTLY AGREED IN THE WANT OF MORE MONEY, AND A STRONG INCLINATION
FOR A HANDSOME PRESENT FROM HIS FATHER; BUT HERE, AS ON MOST TOPICS, HE
HAD THE SUPERIORITY, FOR WHILE MARY THOUGHT IT A GREAT SHAME THAT SUCH
A PRESENT WAS NOT MADE, HE ALWAYS CONTENDED FOR HIS FATHER'S HAVING
MANY OTHER USES FOR HIS MONEY, AND A RIGHT TO SPEND IT AS HE LIKED.

AS TO THE MANAGEMENT OF THEIR CHILDREN, HIS THEORY WAS MUCH BETTER THAN
HIS WIFE'S, AND HIS PRACTICE NOT SO BAD.  "I COULD MANAGE THEM VERY
WELL, IF IT WERE NOT FOR MARY'S INTERFERENCE," WAS WHAT ANNE OFTEN
HEARD HIM SAY, AND HAD A GOOD DEAL OF FAITH IN; BUT WHEN LISTENING IN
TURN TO MARY'S REPROACH OF "CHARLES SPOILS THE CHILDREN SO THAT I
CANNOT GET THEM INTO ANY ORDER," SHE NEVER HAD THE SMALLEST TEMPTATION
TO SAY, "VERY TRUE."

ONE OF THE LEAST AGREEABLE CIRCUMSTANCES OF HER RESIDENCE THERE WAS HER
BEING TREATED WITH TOO MUCH CONFIDENCE BY ALL PARTIES, AND BEING TOO
MUCH IN THE SECRET OF THE COMPLAINTS OF EACH HOUSE.  KNOWN TO HAVE SOME
INFLUENCE WITH HER SISTER, SHE WAS CONTINUALLY REQUESTED, OR AT LEAST
RECEIVING HINTS TO EXERT IT, BEYOND WHAT WAS PRACTICABLE.  "I WISH YOU
COULD PERSUADE MARY NOT TO BE ALWAYS FANCYING HERSELF ILL," WAS
CHARLES'S LANGUAGE; AND, IN AN UNHAPPY MOOD, THUS SPOKE MARY: "I DO
BELIEVE IF CHARLES WERE TO SEE ME DYING, HE WOULD NOT THINK THERE WAS
ANYTHING THE MATTER WITH ME.  I AM SURE, ANNE, IF YOU WOULD, YOU MIGHT
PERSUADE HIM THAT I REALLY AM VERY ILL--A GREAT DEAL WORSE THAN I EVER
OWN."

MARY'S DECLARATION WAS, "I HATE SENDING THE CHILDREN TO THE GREAT
HOUSE, THOUGH THEIR GRANDMAMMA IS ALWAYS WANTING TO SEE THEM, FOR SHE
HUMOURS AND INDULGES THEM TO SUCH A DEGREE, AND GIVES THEM SO MUCH
TRASH AND SWEET THINGS, THAT THEY ARE SURE TO COME BACK SICK AND CROSS
FOR THE REST OF THE DAY."  AND MRS MUSGROVE TOOK THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY
OF BEING ALONE WITH ANNE, TO SAY, "OH! MISS ANNE, I CANNOT HELP WISHING
MRS CHARLES HAD A LITTLE OF YOUR METHOD WITH THOSE CHILDREN.  THEY ARE
QUITE DIFFERENT CREATURES WITH YOU!  BUT TO BE SURE, IN GENERAL THEY
ARE SO SPOILT!  IT IS A PITY YOU CANNOT PUT YOUR SISTER IN THE WAY OF
MANAGING THEM.  THEY ARE AS FINE HEALTHY CHILDREN AS EVER WERE SEEN,
POOR LITTLE DEARS! WITHOUT PARTIALITY; BUT MRS CHARLES KNOWS NO MORE
HOW THEY SHOULD BE TREATED--!  BLESS ME! HOW TROUBLESOME THEY ARE
SOMETIMES.  I ASSURE YOU, MISS ANNE, IT PREVENTS MY WISHING TO SEE THEM
AT OUR HOUSE SO OFTEN AS I OTHERWISE SHOULD.  I BELIEVE MRS CHARLES IS
NOT QUITE PLEASED WITH MY NOT INVITING THEM OFTENER; BUT YOU KNOW IT IS
VERY BAD TO HAVE CHILDREN WITH ONE THAT ONE IS OBLIGATED TO BE CHECKING
EVERY MOMENT; "DON'T DO THIS," AND "DON'T DO THAT;" OR THAT ONE CAN
ONLY KEEP IN TOLERABLE ORDER BY MORE CAKE THAN IS GOOD FOR THEM."

SHE HAD THIS COMMUNICATION, MOREOVER, FROM MARY.  "MRS MUSGROVE THINKS
ALL HER SERVANTS SO STEADY, THAT IT WOULD BE HIGH TREASON TO CALL IT IN
QUESTION; BUT I AM SURE, WITHOUT EXAGGERATION, THAT HER UPPER
HOUSE-MAID AND LAUNDRY-MAID, INSTEAD OF BEING IN THEIR BUSINESS, ARE
GADDING ABOUT THE VILLAGE, ALL DAY LONG.  I MEET THEM WHEREVER I GO;
AND I DECLARE, I NEVER GO TWICE INTO MY NURSERY WITHOUT SEEING
SOMETHING OF THEM.  IF JEMIMA WERE NOT THE TRUSTIEST, STEADIEST
CREATURE IN THE WORLD, IT WOULD BE ENOUGH TO SPOIL HER; FOR SHE TELLS
ME, THEY ARE ALWAYS TEMPTING HER TO TAKE A WALK WITH THEM." AND ON MRS
MUSGROVE'S SIDE, IT WAS, "I MAKE A RULE OF NEVER INTERFERING IN ANY OF
MY DAUGHTER-IN-LAW'S CONCERNS, FOR I KNOW IT WOULD NOT DO; BUT I SHALL
TELL YOU, MISS ANNE, BECAUSE YOU MAY BE ABLE TO SET THINGS TO RIGHTS,
THAT I HAVE NO VERY GOOD OPINION OF MRS CHARLES'S NURSERY-MAID: I HEAR
STRANGE STORIES OF HER; SHE IS ALWAYS UPON THE GAD; AND FROM MY OWN
KNOWLEDGE, I CAN DECLARE, SHE IS SUCH A FINE-DRESSING LADY, THAT SHE IS
ENOUGH TO RUIN ANY SERVANTS SHE COMES NEAR.  MRS CHARLES QUITE SWEARS
BY HER, I KNOW; BUT I JUST GIVE YOU THIS HINT, THAT YOU MAY BE UPON THE
WATCH; BECAUSE, IF YOU SEE ANYTHING AMISS, YOU NEED NOT BE AFRAID OF
MENTIONING IT."

AGAIN, IT WAS MARY'S COMPLAINT, THAT MRS MUSGROVE WAS VERY APT NOT TO
GIVE HER THE PRECEDENCE THAT WAS HER DUE, WHEN THEY DINED AT THE GREAT
HOUSE WITH OTHER FAMILIES; AND SHE DID NOT SEE ANY REASON WHY SHE WAS
TO BE CONSIDERED SO MUCH AT HOME AS TO LOSE HER PLACE.  AND ONE DAY
WHEN ANNE WAS WALKING WITH ONLY THE MUSGROVES, ONE OF THEM AFTER
TALKING OF RANK, PEOPLE OF RANK, AND JEALOUSY OF RANK, SAID, "I HAVE NO
SCRUPLE OF OBSERVING TO YOU, HOW NONSENSICAL SOME PERSONS ARE ABOUT
THEIR PLACE, BECAUSE ALL THE WORLD KNOWS HOW EASY AND INDIFFERENT YOU
ARE ABOUT IT; BUT I WISH ANYBODY COULD GIVE MARY A HINT THAT IT WOULD
BE A GREAT DEAL BETTER IF SHE WERE NOT SO VERY TENACIOUS, ESPECIALLY IF
SHE WOULD NOT BE ALWAYS PUTTING HERSELF FORWARD TO TAKE PLACE OF MAMMA.
NOBODY DOUBTS HER RIGHT TO HAVE PRECEDENCE OF MAMMA, BUT IT WOULD BE
MORE BECOMING IN HER NOT TO BE ALWAYS INSISTING ON IT.  IT IS NOT THAT
MAMMA CARES ABOUT IT THE LEAST IN THE WORLD, BUT I KNOW IT IS TAKEN
NOTICE OF BY MANY PERSONS."

HOW WAS ANNE TO SET ALL THESE MATTERS TO RIGHTS?  SHE COULD DO LITTLE
MORE THAN LISTEN PATIENTLY, SOFTEN EVERY GRIEVANCE, AND EXCUSE EACH TO
THE OTHER; GIVE THEM ALL HINTS OF THE FORBEARANCE NECESSARY BETWEEN
SUCH NEAR NEIGHBOURS, AND MAKE THOSE HINTS BROADEST WHICH WERE MEANT
FOR HER SISTER'S BENEFIT.

IN ALL OTHER RESPECTS, HER VISIT BEGAN AND PROCEEDED VERY WELL.  HER
OWN SPIRITS IMPROVED BY CHANGE OF PLACE AND SUBJECT, BY BEING REMOVED
THREE MILES FROM KELLYNCH; MARY'S AILMENTS LESSENED BY HAVING A
CONSTANT COMPANION, AND THEIR DAILY INTERCOURSE WITH THE OTHER FAMILY,
SINCE THERE WAS NEITHER SUPERIOR AFFECTION, CONFIDENCE, NOR EMPLOYMENT
IN THE COTTAGE, TO BE INTERRUPTED BY IT, WAS RATHER AN ADVANTAGE.  IT
WAS CERTAINLY CARRIED NEARLY AS FAR AS POSSIBLE, FOR THEY MET EVERY
MORNING, AND HARDLY EVER SPENT AN EVENING ASUNDER; BUT SHE BELIEVED
THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE DONE SO WELL WITHOUT THE SIGHT OF MR AND MRS
MUSGROVE'S RESPECTABLE FORMS IN THE USUAL PLACES, OR WITHOUT THE
TALKING, LAUGHING, AND SINGING OF THEIR DAUGHTERS.

SHE PLAYED A GREAT DEAL BETTER THAN EITHER OF THE MISS MUSGROVES, BUT
HAVING NO VOICE, NO KNOWLEDGE OF THE HARP, AND NO FOND PARENTS, TO SIT
BY AND FANCY THEMSELVES DELIGHTED, HER PERFORMANCE WAS LITTLE THOUGHT
OF, ONLY OUT OF CIVILITY, OR TO REFRESH THE OTHERS, AS SHE WAS WELL
AWARE.  SHE KNEW THAT WHEN SHE PLAYED SHE WAS GIVING PLEASURE ONLY TO
HERSELF; BUT THIS WAS NO NEW SENSATION.  EXCEPTING ONE SHORT PERIOD OF
HER LIFE, SHE HAD NEVER, SINCE THE AGE OF FOURTEEN, NEVER SINCE THE
LOSS OF HER DEAR MOTHER, KNOWN THE HAPPINESS OF BEING LISTENED TO, OR
ENCOURAGED BY ANY JUST APPRECIATION OR REAL TASTE.  IN MUSIC SHE HAD
BEEN ALWAYS USED TO FEEL ALONE IN THE WORLD; AND MR AND MRS MUSGROVE'S
FOND PARTIALITY FOR THEIR OWN DAUGHTERS' PERFORMANCE, AND TOTAL
INDIFFERENCE TO ANY OTHER PERSON'S, GAVE HER MUCH MORE PLEASURE FOR
THEIR SAKES, THAN MORTIFICATION FOR HER OWN.

THE PARTY AT THE GREAT HOUSE WAS SOMETIMES INCREASED BY OTHER COMPANY.
THE NEIGHBOURHOOD WAS NOT LARGE, BUT THE MUSGROVES WERE VISITED BY
EVERYBODY, AND HAD MORE DINNER-PARTIES, AND MORE CALLERS, MORE VISITORS
BY INVITATION AND BY CHANCE, THAN ANY OTHER FAMILY.  THERE WERE MORE
COMPLETELY POPULAR.

THE GIRLS WERE WILD FOR DANCING; AND THE EVENINGS ENDED, OCCASIONALLY,
IN AN UNPREMEDITATED LITTLE BALL.  THERE WAS A FAMILY OF COUSINS WITHIN
A WALK OF UPPERCROSS, IN LESS AFFLUENT CIRCUMSTANCES, WHO DEPENDED ON
THE MUSGROVES FOR ALL THEIR PLEASURES:  THEY WOULD COME AT ANY TIME,
AND HELP PLAY AT ANYTHING, OR DANCE ANYWHERE; AND ANNE, VERY MUCH
PREFERRING THE OFFICE OF MUSICIAN TO A MORE ACTIVE POST, PLAYED COUNTRY
DANCES TO THEM BY THE HOUR TOGETHER; A KINDNESS WHICH ALWAYS
RECOMMENDED HER MUSICAL POWERS TO THE NOTICE OF MR AND MRS MUSGROVE
MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE, AND OFTEN DREW THIS COMPLIMENT;--"WELL DONE,
MISS ANNE! VERY WELL DONE INDEED!  LORD BLESS ME!  HOW THOSE LITTLE
FINGERS OF YOURS FLY ABOUT!"

SO PASSED THE FIRST THREE WEEKS.  MICHAELMAS CAME; AND NOW ANNE'S HEART
MUST BE IN KELLYNCH AGAIN.  A BELOVED HOME MADE OVER TO OTHERS; ALL THE
PRECIOUS ROOMS AND FURNITURE, GROVES, AND PROSPECTS, BEGINNING TO OWN
OTHER EYES AND OTHER LIMBS!  SHE COULD NOT THINK OF MUCH ELSE ON THE
29TH OF SEPTEMBER; AND SHE HAD THIS SYMPATHETIC TOUCH IN THE EVENING
FROM MARY, WHO, ON HAVING OCCASION TO NOTE DOWN THE DAY OF THE MONTH,
EXCLAIMED, "DEAR ME, IS NOT THIS THE DAY THE CROFTS WERE TO COME TO
KELLYNCH?  I AM GLAD I DID NOT THINK OF IT BEFORE.  HOW LOW IT MAKES
ME!"

THE CROFTS TOOK POSSESSION WITH TRUE NAVAL ALERTNESS, AND WERE TO BE
VISITED.  MARY DEPLORED THE NECESSITY FOR HERSELF.  "NOBODY KNEW HOW
MUCH SHE SHOULD SUFFER.  SHE SHOULD PUT IT OFF AS LONG AS SHE COULD;"
BUT WAS NOT EASY TILL SHE HAD TALKED CHARLES INTO DRIVING HER OVER ON
AN EARLY DAY, AND WAS IN A VERY ANIMATED, COMFORTABLE STATE OF
IMAGINARY AGITATION, WHEN SHE CAME BACK.  ANNE HAD VERY SINCERELY
REJOICED IN THERE BEING NO MEANS OF HER GOING.  SHE WISHED, HOWEVER TO
SEE THE CROFTS, AND WAS GLAD TO BE WITHIN WHEN THE VISIT WAS RETURNED.
THEY CAME:  THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE WAS NOT AT HOME, BUT THE TWO
SISTERS WERE TOGETHER; AND AS IT CHANCED THAT MRS CROFT FELL TO THE
SHARE OF ANNE, WHILE THE ADMIRAL SAT BY MARY, AND MADE HIMSELF VERY
AGREEABLE BY HIS GOOD-HUMOURED NOTICE OF HER LITTLE BOYS, SHE WAS WELL
ABLE TO WATCH FOR A LIKENESS, AND IF IT FAILED HER IN THE FEATURES, TO
CATCH IT IN THE VOICE, OR IN THE TURN OF SENTIMENT AND EXPRESSION.

MRS CROFT, THOUGH NEITHER TALL NOR FAT, HAD A SQUARENESS, UPRIGHTNESS,
AND VIGOUR OF FORM, WHICH GAVE IMPORTANCE TO HER PERSON.  SHE HAD
BRIGHT DARK EYES, GOOD TEETH, AND ALTOGETHER AN AGREEABLE FACE; THOUGH
HER REDDENED AND WEATHER-BEATEN COMPLEXION, THE CONSEQUENCE OF HER
HAVING BEEN ALMOST AS MUCH AT SEA AS HER HUSBAND, MADE HER SEEM TO HAVE
LIVED SOME YEARS LONGER IN THE WORLD THAN HER REAL EIGHT-AND-THIRTY.
HER MANNERS WERE OPEN, EASY, AND DECIDED, LIKE ONE WHO HAD NO DISTRUST
OF HERSELF, AND NO DOUBTS OF WHAT TO DO; WITHOUT ANY APPROACH TO
COARSENESS, HOWEVER, OR ANY WANT OF GOOD HUMOUR.  ANNE GAVE HER CREDIT,
INDEED, FOR FEELINGS OF GREAT CONSIDERATION TOWARDS HERSELF, IN ALL
THAT RELATED TO KELLYNCH, AND IT PLEASED HER: ESPECIALLY, AS SHE HAD
SATISFIED HERSELF IN THE VERY FIRST HALF MINUTE, IN THE INSTANT EVEN OF
INTRODUCTION, THAT THERE WAS NOT THE SMALLEST SYMPTOM OF ANY KNOWLEDGE
OR SUSPICION ON MRS CROFT'S SIDE, TO GIVE A BIAS OF ANY SORT.  SHE WAS
QUITE EASY ON THAT HEAD, AND CONSEQUENTLY FULL OF STRENGTH AND COURAGE,
TILL FOR A MOMENT ELECTRIFIED BY MRS CROFT'S SUDDENLY SAYING,--

"IT WAS YOU, AND NOT YOUR SISTER, I FIND, THAT MY BROTHER HAD THE
PLEASURE OF BEING ACQUAINTED WITH, WHEN HE WAS IN THIS COUNTRY."

ANNE HOPED SHE HAD OUTLIVED THE AGE OF BLUSHING; BUT THE AGE OF EMOTION
SHE CERTAINLY HAD NOT.

"PERHAPS YOU MAY NOT HAVE HEARD THAT HE IS MARRIED?" ADDED MRS CROFT.

SHE COULD NOW ANSWER AS SHE OUGHT; AND WAS HAPPY TO FEEL, WHEN MRS
CROFT'S NEXT WORDS EXPLAINED IT TO BE MR WENTWORTH OF WHOM SHE SPOKE,
THAT SHE HAD SAID NOTHING WHICH MIGHT NOT DO FOR EITHER BROTHER. SHE
IMMEDIATELY FELT HOW REASONABLE IT WAS, THAT MRS CROFT SHOULD BE
THINKING AND SPEAKING OF EDWARD, AND NOT OF FREDERICK; AND WITH SHAME
AT HER OWN FORGETFULNESS APPLIED HERSELF TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR
FORMER NEIGHBOUR'S PRESENT STATE WITH PROPER INTEREST.

THE REST WAS ALL TRANQUILLITY; TILL, JUST AS THEY WERE MOVING, SHE
HEARD THE ADMIRAL SAY TO MARY--

"WE ARE EXPECTING A BROTHER OF MRS CROFT'S HERE SOON; I DARE SAY YOU
KNOW HIM BY NAME."

HE WAS CUT SHORT BY THE EAGER ATTACKS OF THE LITTLE BOYS, CLINGING TO
HIM LIKE AN OLD FRIEND, AND DECLARING HE SHOULD NOT GO; AND BEING TOO
MUCH ENGROSSED BY PROPOSALS OF CARRYING THEM AWAY IN HIS COAT POCKETS,
ETC., TO HAVE ANOTHER MOMENT FOR FINISHING OR RECOLLECTING WHAT HE HAD
BEGUN, ANNE WAS LEFT TO PERSUADE HERSELF, AS WELL AS SHE COULD, THAT
THE SAME BROTHER MUST STILL BE IN QUESTION.  SHE COULD NOT, HOWEVER,
REACH SUCH A DEGREE OF CERTAINTY, AS NOT TO BE ANXIOUS TO HEAR WHETHER
ANYTHING HAD BEEN SAID ON THE SUBJECT AT THE OTHER HOUSE, WHERE THE
CROFTS HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN CALLING.

THE FOLKS OF THE GREAT HOUSE WERE TO SPEND THE EVENING OF THIS DAY AT
THE COTTAGE; AND IT BEING NOW TOO LATE IN THE YEAR FOR SUCH VISITS TO
BE MADE ON FOOT, THE COACH WAS BEGINNING TO BE LISTENED FOR, WHEN THE
YOUNGEST MISS MUSGROVE WALKED IN.  THAT SHE WAS COMING TO APOLOGIZE,
AND THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE TO SPEND THE EVENING BY THEMSELVES, WAS THE
FIRST BLACK IDEA; AND MARY WAS QUITE READY TO BE AFFRONTED, WHEN LOUISA
MADE ALL RIGHT BY SAYING, THAT SHE ONLY CAME ON FOOT, TO LEAVE MORE
ROOM FOR THE HARP, WHICH WAS BRINGING IN THE CARRIAGE.

"AND I WILL TELL YOU OUR REASON," SHE ADDED, "AND ALL ABOUT IT.  I AM
COME ON TO GIVE YOU NOTICE, THAT PAPA AND MAMMA ARE OUT OF SPIRITS THIS
EVENING, ESPECIALLY MAMMA; SHE IS THINKING SO MUCH OF POOR RICHARD!
AND WE AGREED IT WOULD BE BEST TO HAVE THE HARP, FOR IT SEEMS TO AMUSE
HER MORE THAN THE PIANO-FORTE.  I WILL TELL YOU WHY SHE IS OUT OF
SPIRITS.  WHEN THE CROFTS CALLED THIS MORNING, (THEY CALLED HERE
AFTERWARDS, DID NOT THEY?), THEY HAPPENED TO SAY, THAT HER BROTHER,
CAPTAIN WENTWORTH, IS JUST RETURNED TO ENGLAND, OR PAID OFF, OR
SOMETHING, AND IS COMING TO SEE THEM ALMOST DIRECTLY; AND MOST
UNLUCKILY IT CAME INTO MAMMA'S HEAD, WHEN THEY WERE GONE, THAT
WENTWORTH, OR SOMETHING VERY LIKE IT, WAS THE NAME OF POOR RICHARD'S
CAPTAIN AT ONE TIME; I DO NOT KNOW WHEN OR WHERE, BUT A GREAT WHILE
BEFORE HE DIED, POOR FELLOW!  AND UPON LOOKING OVER HIS LETTERS AND
THINGS, SHE FOUND IT WAS SO, AND IS PERFECTLY SURE THAT THIS MUST BE
THE VERY MAN, AND HER HEAD IS QUITE FULL OF IT, AND OF POOR RICHARD!
SO WE MUST BE AS MERRY AS WE CAN, THAT SHE MAY NOT BE DWELLING UPON
SUCH GLOOMY THINGS."

THE REAL CIRCUMSTANCES OF THIS PATHETIC PIECE OF FAMILY HISTORY WERE,
THAT THE MUSGROVES HAD HAD THE ILL FORTUNE OF A VERY TROUBLESOME,
HOPELESS SON; AND THE GOOD FORTUNE TO LOSE HIM BEFORE HE REACHED HIS
TWENTIETH YEAR; THAT HE HAD BEEN SENT TO SEA BECAUSE HE WAS STUPID AND
UNMANAGEABLE ON SHORE; THAT HE HAD BEEN VERY LITTLE CARED FOR AT ANY
TIME BY HIS FAMILY, THOUGH QUITE AS MUCH AS HE DESERVED; SELDOM HEARD
OF, AND SCARCELY AT ALL REGRETTED, WHEN THE INTELLIGENCE OF HIS DEATH
ABROAD HAD WORKED ITS WAY TO UPPERCROSS, TWO YEARS BEFORE.

HE HAD, IN FACT, THOUGH HIS SISTERS WERE NOW DOING ALL THEY COULD FOR
HIM, BY CALLING HIM "POOR RICHARD," BEEN NOTHING BETTER THAN A
THICK-HEADED, UNFEELING, UNPROFITABLE DICK MUSGROVE, WHO HAD NEVER DONE
ANYTHING TO ENTITLE HIMSELF TO MORE THAN THE ABBREVIATION OF HIS NAME,
LIVING OR DEAD.

HE HAD BEEN SEVERAL YEARS AT SEA, AND HAD, IN THE COURSE OF THOSE
REMOVALS TO WHICH ALL MIDSHIPMEN ARE LIABLE, AND ESPECIALLY SUCH
MIDSHIPMEN AS EVERY CAPTAIN WISHES TO GET RID OF, BEEN SIX MONTHS ON
BOARD CAPTAIN FREDERICK WENTWORTH'S FRIGATE, THE LACONIA; AND FROM THE
LACONIA HE HAD, UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF HIS CAPTAIN, WRITTEN THE ONLY
TWO LETTERS WHICH HIS FATHER AND MOTHER HAD EVER RECEIVED FROM HIM
DURING THE WHOLE OF HIS ABSENCE; THAT IS TO SAY, THE ONLY TWO
DISINTERESTED LETTERS; ALL THE REST HAD BEEN MERE APPLICATIONS FOR
MONEY.

IN EACH LETTER HE HAD SPOKEN WELL OF HIS CAPTAIN; BUT YET, SO LITTLE
WERE THEY IN THE HABIT OF ATTENDING TO SUCH MATTERS, SO UNOBSERVANT AND
INCURIOUS WERE THEY AS TO THE NAMES OF MEN OR SHIPS, THAT IT HAD MADE
SCARCELY ANY IMPRESSION AT THE TIME; AND THAT MRS MUSGROVE SHOULD HAVE
BEEN SUDDENLY STRUCK, THIS VERY DAY, WITH A RECOLLECTION OF THE NAME OF
WENTWORTH, AS CONNECTED WITH HER SON, SEEMED ONE OF THOSE EXTRAORDINARY
BURSTS OF MIND WHICH DO SOMETIMES OCCUR.

SHE HAD GONE TO HER LETTERS, AND FOUND IT ALL AS SHE SUPPOSED; AND THE
RE-PERUSAL OF THESE LETTERS, AFTER SO LONG AN INTERVAL, HER POOR SON
GONE FOR EVER, AND ALL THE STRENGTH OF HIS FAULTS FORGOTTEN, HAD
AFFECTED HER SPIRITS EXCEEDINGLY, AND THROWN HER INTO GREATER GRIEF FOR
HIM THAN SHE HAD KNOWN ON FIRST HEARING OF HIS DEATH.  MR MUSGROVE WAS,
IN A LESSER DEGREE, AFFECTED LIKEWISE; AND WHEN THEY REACHED THE
COTTAGE, THEY WERE EVIDENTLY IN WANT, FIRST, OF BEING LISTENED TO ANEW
ON THIS SUBJECT, AND AFTERWARDS, OF ALL THE RELIEF WHICH CHEERFUL
COMPANIONS COULD GIVE THEM.

TO HEAR THEM TALKING SO MUCH OF CAPTAIN WENTWORTH, REPEATING HIS NAME
SO OFTEN, PUZZLING OVER PAST YEARS, AND AT LAST ASCERTAINING THAT IT
MIGHT, THAT IT PROBABLY WOULD, TURN OUT TO BE THE VERY SAME CAPTAIN
WENTWORTH WHOM THEY RECOLLECTED MEETING, ONCE OR TWICE, AFTER THEIR
COMING BACK FROM CLIFTON--A VERY FINE YOUNG MAN--BUT THEY COULD NOT SAY
WHETHER IT WAS SEVEN OR EIGHT YEARS AGO, WAS A NEW SORT OF TRIAL TO
ANNE'S NERVES.  SHE FOUND, HOWEVER, THAT IT WAS ONE TO WHICH SHE MUST
INURE HERSELF.  SINCE HE ACTUALLY WAS EXPECTED IN THE COUNTRY, SHE MUST
TEACH HERSELF TO BE INSENSIBLE ON SUCH POINTS.  AND NOT ONLY DID IT
APPEAR THAT HE WAS EXPECTED, AND SPEEDILY, BUT THE MUSGROVES, IN THEIR
WARM GRATITUDE FOR THE KINDNESS HE HAD SHEWN POOR DICK, AND VERY HIGH
RESPECT FOR HIS CHARACTER, STAMPED AS IT WAS BY POOR DICK'S HAVING BEEN
SIX MONTHS UNDER HIS CARE, AND MENTIONING HIM IN STRONG, THOUGH NOT
PERFECTLY WELL-SPELT PRAISE, AS "A FINE DASHING FELOW, ONLY TWO
PERTICULAR ABOUT THE SCHOOLMASTER," WERE BENT ON INTRODUCING
THEMSELVES, AND SEEKING HIS ACQUAINTANCE, AS SOON AS THEY COULD HEAR OF
HIS ARRIVAL.

THE RESOLUTION OF DOING SO HELPED TO FORM THE COMFORT OF THEIR EVENING.



CHAPTER 7


A VERY FEW DAYS MORE, AND CAPTAIN WENTWORTH WAS KNOWN TO BE AT
KELLYNCH, AND MR MUSGROVE HAD CALLED ON HIM, AND COME BACK WARM IN HIS
PRAISE, AND HE WAS ENGAGED WITH THE CROFTS TO DINE AT UPPERCROSS, BY
THE END OF ANOTHER WEEK.  IT HAD BEEN A GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT TO MR
MUSGROVE TO FIND THAT NO EARLIER DAY COULD BE FIXED, SO IMPATIENT WAS
HE TO SHEW HIS GRATITUDE, BY SEEING CAPTAIN WENTWORTH UNDER HIS OWN
ROOF, AND WELCOMING HIM TO ALL THAT WAS STRONGEST AND BEST IN HIS
CELLARS.  BUT A WEEK MUST PASS; ONLY A WEEK, IN ANNE'S RECKONING, AND
THEN, SHE SUPPOSED, THEY MUST MEET; AND SOON SHE BEGAN TO WISH THAT SHE
COULD FEEL SECURE EVEN FOR A WEEK.

CAPTAIN WENTWORTH MADE A VERY EARLY RETURN TO MR MUSGROVE'S CIVILITY,
AND SHE WAS ALL BUT CALLING THERE IN THE SAME HALF HOUR.  SHE AND MARY
WERE ACTUALLY SETTING FORWARD FOR THE GREAT HOUSE, WHERE, AS SHE
AFTERWARDS LEARNT, THEY MUST INEVITABLY HAVE FOUND HIM, WHEN THEY WERE
STOPPED BY THE ELDEST BOY'S BEING AT THAT MOMENT BROUGHT HOME IN
CONSEQUENCE OF A BAD FALL.  THE CHILD'S SITUATION PUT THE VISIT
ENTIRELY ASIDE; BUT SHE COULD NOT HEAR OF HER ESCAPE WITH INDIFFERENCE,
EVEN IN THE MIDST OF THE SERIOUS ANXIETY WHICH THEY AFTERWARDS FELT ON
HIS ACCOUNT.

HIS COLLAR-BONE WAS FOUND TO BE DISLOCATED, AND SUCH INJURY RECEIVED IN
THE BACK, AS ROUSED THE MOST ALARMING IDEAS.  IT WAS AN AFTERNOON OF
DISTRESS, AND ANNE HAD EVERY THING TO DO AT ONCE; THE APOTHECARY TO
SEND FOR, THE FATHER TO HAVE PURSUED AND INFORMED, THE MOTHER TO
SUPPORT AND KEEP FROM HYSTERICS, THE SERVANTS TO CONTROL, THE YOUNGEST
CHILD TO BANISH, AND THE POOR SUFFERING ONE TO ATTEND AND SOOTHE;
BESIDES SENDING, AS SOON AS SHE RECOLLECTED IT, PROPER NOTICE TO THE
OTHER HOUSE, WHICH BROUGHT HER AN ACCESSION RATHER OF FRIGHTENED,
ENQUIRING COMPANIONS, THAN OF VERY USEFUL ASSISTANTS.

HER BROTHER'S RETURN WAS THE FIRST COMFORT; HE COULD TAKE BEST CARE OF
HIS WIFE; AND THE SECOND BLESSING WAS THE ARRIVAL OF THE APOTHECARY.
TILL HE CAME AND HAD EXAMINED THE CHILD, THEIR APPREHENSIONS WERE THE
WORSE FOR BEING VAGUE; THEY SUSPECTED GREAT INJURY, BUT KNEW NOT WHERE;
BUT NOW THE COLLAR-BONE WAS SOON REPLACED, AND THOUGH MR ROBINSON FELT
AND FELT, AND RUBBED, AND LOOKED GRAVE, AND SPOKE LOW WORDS BOTH TO THE
FATHER AND THE AUNT, STILL THEY WERE ALL TO HOPE THE BEST, AND TO BE
ABLE TO PART AND EAT THEIR DINNER IN TOLERABLE EASE OF MIND; AND THEN
IT WAS, JUST BEFORE THEY PARTED, THAT THE TWO YOUNG AUNTS WERE ABLE SO
FAR TO DIGRESS FROM THEIR NEPHEW'S STATE, AS TO GIVE THE INFORMATION OF
CAPTAIN WENTWORTH'S VISIT; STAYING FIVE MINUTES BEHIND THEIR FATHER AND
MOTHER, TO ENDEAVOUR TO EXPRESS HOW PERFECTLY DELIGHTED THEY WERE WITH
HIM, HOW MUCH HANDSOMER, HOW INFINITELY MORE AGREEABLE THEY THOUGHT HIM
THAN ANY INDIVIDUAL AMONG THEIR MALE ACQUAINTANCE, WHO HAD BEEN AT ALL
A FAVOURITE BEFORE.  HOW GLAD THEY HAD BEEN TO HEAR PAPA INVITE HIM TO
STAY DINNER, HOW SORRY WHEN HE SAID IT WAS QUITE OUT OF HIS POWER, AND
HOW GLAD AGAIN WHEN HE HAD PROMISED IN REPLY TO PAPA AND MAMMA'S
FARTHER PRESSING INVITATIONS TO COME AND DINE WITH THEM ON THE
MORROW--ACTUALLY ON THE MORROW; AND HE HAD PROMISED IT IN SO PLEASANT A
MANNER, AS IF HE FELT ALL THE MOTIVE OF THEIR ATTENTION JUST AS HE
OUGHT.  AND IN SHORT, HE HAD LOOKED AND SAID EVERYTHING WITH SUCH
EXQUISITE GRACE, THAT THEY COULD ASSURE THEM ALL, THEIR HEADS WERE BOTH
TURNED BY HIM; AND OFF THEY RAN, QUITE AS FULL OF GLEE AS OF LOVE, AND
APPARENTLY MORE FULL OF CAPTAIN WENTWORTH THAN OF LITTLE CHARLES.

THE SAME STORY AND THE SAME RAPTURES WERE REPEATED, WHEN THE TWO GIRLS
CAME WITH THEIR FATHER, THROUGH THE GLOOM OF THE EVENING, TO MAKE
ENQUIRIES; AND MR MUSGROVE, NO LONGER UNDER THE FIRST UNEASINESS ABOUT
HIS HEIR, COULD ADD HIS CONFIRMATION AND PRAISE, AND HOPE THERE WOULD
BE NOW NO OCCASION FOR PUTTING CAPTAIN WENTWORTH OFF, AND ONLY BE SORRY
TO THINK THAT THE COTTAGE PARTY, PROBABLY, WOULD NOT LIKE TO LEAVE THE
LITTLE BOY, TO GIVE HIM THE MEETING.  "OH NO; AS TO LEAVING THE LITTLE
BOY," BOTH FATHER AND MOTHER WERE IN MUCH TOO STRONG AND RECENT ALARM
TO BEAR THE THOUGHT; AND ANNE, IN THE JOY OF THE ESCAPE, COULD NOT HELP
ADDING HER WARM PROTESTATIONS TO THEIRS.

CHARLES MUSGROVE, INDEED, AFTERWARDS, SHEWED MORE OF INCLINATION; "THE
CHILD WAS GOING ON SO WELL, AND HE WISHED SO MUCH TO BE INTRODUCED TO
CAPTAIN WENTWORTH, THAT, PERHAPS, HE MIGHT JOIN THEM IN THE EVENING; HE
WOULD NOT DINE FROM HOME, BUT HE MIGHT WALK IN FOR HALF AN HOUR." BUT
IN THIS HE WAS EAGERLY OPPOSED BY HIS WIFE, WITH "OH! NO, INDEED,
CHARLES, I CANNOT BEAR TO HAVE YOU GO AWAY.  ONLY THINK IF ANYTHING
SHOULD HAPPEN?"

THE CHILD HAD A GOOD NIGHT, AND WAS GOING ON WELL THE NEXT DAY.  IT
MUST BE A WORK OF TIME TO ASCERTAIN THAT NO INJURY HAD BEEN DONE TO THE
SPINE; BUT MR ROBINSON FOUND NOTHING TO INCREASE ALARM, AND CHARLES
MUSGROVE BEGAN, CONSEQUENTLY, TO FEEL NO NECESSITY FOR LONGER
CONFINEMENT.  THE CHILD WAS TO BE KEPT IN BED AND AMUSED AS QUIETLY AS
POSSIBLE; BUT WHAT WAS THERE FOR A FATHER TO DO?  THIS WAS QUITE A
FEMALE CASE, AND IT WOULD BE HIGHLY ABSURD IN HIM, WHO COULD BE OF NO
USE AT HOME, TO SHUT HIMSELF UP.  HIS FATHER VERY MUCH WISHED HIM TO
MEET CAPTAIN WENTWORTH, AND THERE BEING NO SUFFICIENT REASON AGAINST
IT, HE OUGHT TO GO; AND IT ENDED IN HIS MAKING A BOLD, PUBLIC
DECLARATION, WHEN HE CAME IN FROM SHOOTING, OF HIS MEANING TO DRESS
DIRECTLY, AND DINE AT THE OTHER HOUSE.

"NOTHING CAN BE GOING ON BETTER THAN THE CHILD," SAID HE; "SO I TOLD MY
FATHER, JUST NOW, THAT I WOULD COME, AND HE THOUGHT ME QUITE RIGHT.
YOUR SISTER BEING WITH YOU, MY LOVE, I HAVE NO SCRUPLE AT ALL.  YOU
WOULD NOT LIKE TO LEAVE HIM YOURSELF, BUT YOU SEE I CAN BE OF NO USE.
ANNE WILL SEND FOR ME IF ANYTHING IS THE MATTER."

HUSBANDS AND WIVES GENERALLY UNDERSTAND WHEN OPPOSITION WILL BE VAIN.
MARY KNEW, FROM CHARLES'S MANNER OF SPEAKING, THAT HE WAS QUITE
DETERMINED ON GOING, AND THAT IT WOULD BE OF NO USE TO TEAZE HIM.  SHE
SAID NOTHING, THEREFORE, TILL HE WAS OUT OF THE ROOM, BUT AS SOON AS
THERE WAS ONLY ANNE TO HEAR--

"SO YOU AND I ARE TO BE LEFT TO SHIFT BY OURSELVES, WITH THIS POOR SICK
CHILD; AND NOT A CREATURE COMING NEAR US ALL THE EVENING!  I KNEW HOW
IT WOULD BE.  THIS IS ALWAYS MY LUCK.  IF THERE IS ANYTHING
DISAGREEABLE GOING ON MEN ARE ALWAYS SURE TO GET OUT OF IT, AND CHARLES
IS AS BAD AS ANY OF THEM.  VERY UNFEELING!  I MUST SAY IT IS VERY
UNFEELING OF HIM TO BE RUNNING AWAY FROM HIS POOR LITTLE BOY.  TALKS OF
HIS BEING GOING ON SO WELL!  HOW DOES HE KNOW THAT HE IS GOING ON WELL,
OR THAT THERE MAY NOT BE A SUDDEN CHANGE HALF AN HOUR HENCE?  I DID NOT
THINK CHARLES WOULD HAVE BEEN SO UNFEELING.  SO HERE HE IS TO GO AWAY
AND ENJOY HIMSELF, AND BECAUSE I AM THE POOR MOTHER, I AM NOT TO BE
ALLOWED TO STIR; AND YET, I AM SURE, I AM MORE UNFIT THAN ANYBODY ELSE
TO BE ABOUT THE CHILD.  MY BEING THE MOTHER IS THE VERY REASON WHY MY
FEELINGS SHOULD NOT BE TRIED.  I AM NOT AT ALL EQUAL TO IT.  YOU SAW
HOW HYSTERICAL I WAS YESTERDAY."

"BUT THAT WAS ONLY THE EFFECT OF THE SUDDENNESS OF YOUR ALARM--OF THE
SHOCK.  YOU WILL NOT BE HYSTERICAL AGAIN.  I DARE SAY WE SHALL HAVE
NOTHING TO DISTRESS US.  I PERFECTLY UNDERSTAND MR ROBINSON'S
DIRECTIONS, AND HAVE NO FEARS; AND INDEED, MARY, I CANNOT WONDER AT
YOUR HUSBAND.  NURSING DOES NOT BELONG TO A MAN; IT IS NOT HIS
PROVINCE.  A SICK CHILD IS ALWAYS THE MOTHER'S PROPERTY:  HER OWN
FEELINGS GENERALLY MAKE IT SO."

"I HOPE I AM AS FOND OF MY CHILD AS ANY MOTHER, BUT I DO NOT KNOW THAT
I AM OF ANY MORE USE IN THE SICK-ROOM THAN CHARLES, FOR I CANNOT BE
ALWAYS SCOLDING AND TEAZING THE POOR CHILD WHEN IT IS ILL; AND YOU SAW,
THIS MORNING, THAT IF I TOLD HIM TO KEEP QUIET, HE WAS SURE TO BEGIN
KICKING ABOUT.  I HAVE NOT NERVES FOR THE SORT OF THING."

"BUT, COULD YOU BE COMFORTABLE YOURSELF, TO BE SPENDING THE WHOLE
EVENING AWAY FROM THE POOR BOY?"

"YES; YOU SEE HIS PAPA CAN, AND WHY SHOULD NOT I?  JEMIMA IS SO
CAREFUL; AND SHE COULD SEND US WORD EVERY HOUR HOW HE WAS.  I REALLY
THINK CHARLES MIGHT AS WELL HAVE TOLD HIS FATHER WE WOULD ALL COME.  I
AM NOT MORE ALARMED ABOUT LITTLE CHARLES NOW THAN HE IS.  I WAS
DREADFULLY ALARMED YESTERDAY, BUT THE CASE IS VERY DIFFERENT TO-DAY."

"WELL, IF YOU DO NOT THINK IT TOO LATE TO GIVE NOTICE FOR YOURSELF,
SUPPOSE YOU WERE TO GO, AS WELL AS YOUR HUSBAND.  LEAVE LITTLE CHARLES
TO MY CARE.  MR AND MRS MUSGROVE CANNOT THINK IT WRONG WHILE I REMAIN
WITH HIM."

"ARE YOU SERIOUS?" CRIED MARY, HER EYES BRIGHTENING.  "DEAR ME!  THAT'S
A VERY GOOD THOUGHT, VERY GOOD, INDEED.  TO BE SURE, I MAY JUST AS WELL
GO AS NOT, FOR I AM OF NO USE AT HOME--AM I?  AND IT ONLY HARASSES ME.
YOU, WHO HAVE NOT A MOTHER'S FEELINGS, ARE A GREAT DEAL THE PROPEREST
PERSON.  YOU CAN MAKE LITTLE CHARLES DO ANYTHING; HE ALWAYS MINDS YOU
AT A WORD.  IT WILL BE A GREAT DEAL BETTER THAN LEAVING HIM ONLY WITH
JEMIMA.  OH! I SHALL CERTAINLY GO; I AM SURE I OUGHT IF I CAN, QUITE AS
MUCH AS CHARLES, FOR THEY WANT ME EXCESSIVELY TO BE ACQUAINTED WITH
CAPTAIN WENTWORTH, AND I KNOW YOU DO NOT MIND BEING LEFT ALONE.  AN
EXCELLENT THOUGHT OF YOURS, INDEED, ANNE.  I WILL GO AND TELL CHARLES,
AND GET READY DIRECTLY.  YOU CAN SEND FOR US, YOU KNOW, AT A MOMENT'S
NOTICE, IF ANYTHING IS THE MATTER; BUT I DARE SAY THERE WILL BE NOTHING
TO ALARM YOU.  I SHOULD NOT GO, YOU MAY BE SURE, IF I DID NOT FEEL
QUITE AT EASE ABOUT MY DEAR CHILD."

THE NEXT MOMENT SHE WAS TAPPING AT HER HUSBAND'S DRESSING-ROOM DOOR,
AND AS ANNE FOLLOWED HER UP STAIRS, SHE WAS IN TIME FOR THE WHOLE
CONVERSATION, WHICH BEGAN WITH MARY'S SAYING, IN A TONE OF GREAT
EXULTATION--

"I MEAN TO GO WITH YOU, CHARLES, FOR I AM OF NO MORE USE AT HOME THAN
YOU ARE.  IF I WERE TO SHUT MYSELF UP FOR EVER WITH THE CHILD, I SHOULD
NOT BE ABLE TO PERSUADE HIM TO DO ANYTHING HE DID NOT LIKE.  ANNE WILL
STAY; ANNE UNDERTAKES TO STAY AT HOME AND TAKE CARE OF HIM.  IT IS
ANNE'S OWN PROPOSAL, AND SO I SHALL GO WITH YOU, WHICH WILL BE A GREAT
DEAL BETTER, FOR I HAVE NOT DINED AT THE OTHER HOUSE SINCE TUESDAY."

"THIS IS VERY KIND OF ANNE," WAS HER HUSBAND'S ANSWER, "AND I SHOULD BE
VERY GLAD TO HAVE YOU GO; BUT IT SEEMS RATHER HARD THAT SHE SHOULD BE
LEFT AT HOME BY HERSELF, TO NURSE OUR SICK CHILD."

ANNE WAS NOW AT HAND TO TAKE UP HER OWN CAUSE, AND THE SINCERITY OF HER
MANNER BEING SOON SUFFICIENT TO CONVINCE HIM, WHERE CONVICTION WAS AT
LEAST VERY AGREEABLE, HE HAD NO FARTHER SCRUPLES AS TO HER BEING LEFT
TO DINE ALONE, THOUGH HE STILL WANTED HER TO JOIN THEM IN THE EVENING,
WHEN THE CHILD MIGHT BE AT REST FOR THE NIGHT, AND KINDLY URGED HER TO
LET HIM COME AND FETCH HER, BUT SHE WAS QUITE UNPERSUADABLE; AND THIS
BEING THE CASE, SHE HAD ERE LONG THE PLEASURE OF SEEING THEM SET OFF
TOGETHER IN HIGH SPIRITS.  THEY WERE GONE, SHE HOPED, TO BE HAPPY,
HOWEVER ODDLY CONSTRUCTED SUCH HAPPINESS MIGHT SEEM; AS FOR HERSELF,
SHE WAS LEFT WITH AS MANY SENSATIONS OF COMFORT, AS WERE, PERHAPS, EVER
LIKELY TO BE HERS.  SHE KNEW HERSELF TO BE OF THE FIRST UTILITY TO THE
CHILD; AND WHAT WAS IT TO HER IF FREDERICK WENTWORTH WERE ONLY HALF A
MILE DISTANT, MAKING HIMSELF AGREEABLE TO OTHERS?

SHE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO KNOW HOW HE FELT AS TO A MEETING.  PERHAPS
INDIFFERENT, IF INDIFFERENCE COULD EXIST UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES.  HE
MUST BE EITHER INDIFFERENT OR UNWILLING.  HAD HE WISHED EVER TO SEE HER
AGAIN, HE NEED NOT HAVE WAITED TILL THIS TIME; HE WOULD HAVE DONE WHAT
SHE COULD NOT BUT BELIEVE THAT IN HIS PLACE SHE SHOULD HAVE DONE LONG
AGO, WHEN EVENTS HAD BEEN EARLY GIVING HIM THE INDEPENDENCE WHICH ALONE
HAD BEEN WANTING.

HER BROTHER AND SISTER CAME BACK DELIGHTED WITH THEIR NEW ACQUAINTANCE,
AND THEIR VISIT IN GENERAL.  THERE HAD BEEN MUSIC, SINGING, TALKING,
LAUGHING, ALL THAT WAS MOST AGREEABLE; CHARMING MANNERS IN CAPTAIN
WENTWORTH, NO SHYNESS OR RESERVE; THEY SEEMED ALL TO KNOW EACH OTHER
PERFECTLY, AND HE WAS COMING THE VERY NEXT MORNING TO SHOOT WITH
CHARLES.  HE WAS TO COME TO BREAKFAST, BUT NOT AT THE COTTAGE, THOUGH
THAT HAD BEEN PROPOSED AT FIRST; BUT THEN HE HAD BEEN PRESSED TO COME
TO THE GREAT HOUSE INSTEAD, AND HE SEEMED AFRAID OF BEING IN MRS
CHARLES MUSGROVE'S WAY, ON ACCOUNT OF THE CHILD, AND THEREFORE,
SOMEHOW, THEY HARDLY KNEW HOW, IT ENDED IN CHARLES'S BEING TO MEET HIM
TO BREAKFAST AT HIS FATHER'S.

ANNE UNDERSTOOD IT.  HE WISHED TO AVOID SEEING HER.  HE HAD INQUIRED
AFTER HER, SHE FOUND, SLIGHTLY, AS MIGHT SUIT A FORMER SLIGHT
ACQUAINTANCE, SEEMING TO ACKNOWLEDGE SUCH AS SHE HAD ACKNOWLEDGED,
ACTUATED, PERHAPS, BY THE SAME VIEW OF ESCAPING INTRODUCTION WHEN THEY
WERE TO MEET.

THE MORNING HOURS OF THE COTTAGE WERE ALWAYS LATER THAN THOSE OF THE
OTHER HOUSE, AND ON THE MORROW THE DIFFERENCE WAS SO GREAT THAT MARY
AND ANNE WERE NOT MORE THAN BEGINNING BREAKFAST WHEN CHARLES CAME IN TO
SAY THAT THEY WERE JUST SETTING OFF, THAT HE WAS COME FOR HIS DOGS,
THAT HIS SISTERS WERE FOLLOWING WITH CAPTAIN WENTWORTH; HIS SISTERS
MEANING TO VISIT MARY AND THE CHILD, AND CAPTAIN WENTWORTH PROPOSING
ALSO TO WAIT ON HER FOR A FEW MINUTES IF NOT INCONVENIENT; AND THOUGH
CHARLES HAD ANSWERED FOR THE CHILD'S BEING IN NO SUCH STATE AS COULD
MAKE IT INCONVENIENT, CAPTAIN WENTWORTH WOULD NOT BE SATISFIED WITHOUT
HIS RUNNING ON TO GIVE NOTICE.

MARY, VERY MUCH GRATIFIED BY THIS ATTENTION, WAS DELIGHTED TO RECEIVE
HIM, WHILE A THOUSAND FEELINGS RUSHED ON ANNE, OF WHICH THIS WAS THE
MOST CONSOLING, THAT IT WOULD SOON BE OVER.  AND IT WAS SOON OVER.  IN
TWO MINUTES AFTER CHARLES'S PREPARATION, THE OTHERS APPEARED; THEY WERE
IN THE DRAWING-ROOM.  HER EYE HALF MET CAPTAIN WENTWORTH'S, A BOW, A
CURTSEY PASSED; SHE HEARD HIS VOICE; HE TALKED TO MARY, SAID ALL THAT
WAS RIGHT, SAID SOMETHING TO THE MISS MUSGROVES, ENOUGH TO MARK AN EASY
FOOTING; THE ROOM SEEMED FULL, FULL OF PERSONS AND VOICES, BUT A FEW
MINUTES ENDED IT.  CHARLES SHEWED HIMSELF AT THE WINDOW, ALL WAS READY,
THEIR VISITOR HAD BOWED AND WAS GONE, THE MISS MUSGROVES WERE GONE TOO,
SUDDENLY RESOLVING TO WALK TO THE END OF THE VILLAGE WITH THE
SPORTSMEN:  THE ROOM WAS CLEARED, AND ANNE MIGHT FINISH HER BREAKFAST
AS SHE COULD.

"IT IS OVER! IT IS OVER!" SHE REPEATED TO HERSELF AGAIN AND AGAIN, IN
NERVOUS GRATITUDE.  "THE WORST IS OVER!"

MARY TALKED, BUT SHE COULD NOT ATTEND.  SHE HAD SEEN HIM.  THEY HAD
MET.  THEY HAD BEEN ONCE MORE IN THE SAME ROOM.

SOON, HOWEVER, SHE BEGAN TO REASON WITH HERSELF, AND TRY TO BE FEELING
LESS.  EIGHT YEARS, ALMOST EIGHT YEARS HAD PASSED, SINCE ALL HAD BEEN
GIVEN UP.  HOW ABSURD TO BE RESUMING THE AGITATION WHICH SUCH AN
INTERVAL HAD BANISHED INTO DISTANCE AND INDISTINCTNESS!  WHAT MIGHT NOT
EIGHT YEARS DO?  EVENTS OF EVERY DESCRIPTION, CHANGES, ALIENATIONS,
REMOVALS--ALL, ALL MUST BE COMPRISED IN IT, AND OBLIVION OF THE PAST--
HOW NATURAL, HOW CERTAIN TOO!  IT INCLUDED NEARLY A THIRD PART OF HER
OWN LIFE.

ALAS! WITH ALL HER REASONING, SHE FOUND, THAT TO RETENTIVE FEELINGS
EIGHT YEARS MAY BE LITTLE MORE THAN NOTHING.

NOW, HOW WERE HIS SENTIMENTS TO BE READ?  WAS THIS LIKE WISHING TO
AVOID HER?  AND THE NEXT MOMENT SHE WAS HATING HERSELF FOR THE FOLLY
WHICH ASKED THE QUESTION.

ON ONE OTHER QUESTION WHICH PERHAPS HER UTMOST WISDOM MIGHT NOT HAVE
PREVENTED, SHE WAS SOON SPARED ALL SUSPENSE; FOR, AFTER THE MISS
MUSGROVES HAD RETURNED AND FINISHED THEIR VISIT AT THE COTTAGE SHE HAD
THIS SPONTANEOUS INFORMATION FROM MARY:--

"CAPTAIN WENTWORTH IS NOT VERY GALLANT BY YOU, ANNE, THOUGH HE WAS SO
ATTENTIVE TO ME.  HENRIETTA ASKED HIM WHAT HE THOUGHT OF YOU, WHEN THEY
WENT AWAY, AND HE SAID, 'YOU WERE SO ALTERED HE SHOULD NOT HAVE KNOWN
YOU AGAIN.'"

MARY HAD NO FEELINGS TO MAKE HER RESPECT HER SISTER'S IN A COMMON WAY,
BUT SHE WAS PERFECTLY UNSUSPICIOUS OF BEING INFLICTING ANY PECULIAR
WOUND.

"ALTERED BEYOND HIS KNOWLEDGE."  ANNE FULLY SUBMITTED, IN SILENT, DEEP
MORTIFICATION.  DOUBTLESS IT WAS SO, AND SHE COULD TAKE NO REVENGE, FOR
HE WAS NOT ALTERED, OR NOT FOR THE WORSE.  SHE HAD ALREADY ACKNOWLEDGED
IT TO HERSELF, AND SHE COULD NOT THINK DIFFERENTLY, LET HIM THINK OF
HER AS HE WOULD.  NO:  THE YEARS WHICH HAD DESTROYED HER YOUTH AND
BLOOM HAD ONLY GIVEN HIM A MORE GLOWING, MANLY, OPEN LOOK, IN NO
RESPECT LESSENING HIS PERSONAL ADVANTAGES.  SHE HAD SEEN THE SAME
FREDERICK WENTWORTH.

"SO ALTERED THAT HE SHOULD NOT HAVE KNOWN HER AGAIN!"  THESE WERE WORDS
WHICH COULD NOT BUT DWELL WITH HER.  YET SHE SOON BEGAN TO REJOICE THAT
SHE HAD HEARD THEM.  THEY WERE OF SOBERING TENDENCY; THEY ALLAYED
AGITATION; THEY COMPOSED, AND CONSEQUENTLY MUST MAKE HER HAPPIER.

FREDERICK WENTWORTH HAD USED SUCH WORDS, OR SOMETHING LIKE THEM, BUT
WITHOUT AN IDEA THAT THEY WOULD BE CARRIED ROUND TO HER.  HE HAD
THOUGHT HER WRETCHEDLY ALTERED, AND IN THE FIRST MOMENT OF APPEAL, HAD
SPOKEN AS HE FELT.  HE HAD NOT FORGIVEN ANNE ELLIOT.  SHE HAD USED HIM
ILL, DESERTED AND DISAPPOINTED HIM; AND WORSE, SHE HAD SHEWN A
FEEBLENESS OF CHARACTER IN DOING SO, WHICH HIS OWN DECIDED, CONFIDENT
TEMPER COULD NOT ENDURE.  SHE HAD GIVEN HIM UP TO OBLIGE OTHERS.  IT
HAD BEEN THE EFFECT OF OVER-PERSUASION.  IT HAD BEEN WEAKNESS AND
TIMIDITY.

HE HAD BEEN MOST WARMLY ATTACHED TO HER, AND HAD NEVER SEEN A WOMAN
SINCE WHOM HE THOUGHT HER EQUAL; BUT, EXCEPT FROM SOME NATURAL
SENSATION OF CURIOSITY, HE HAD NO DESIRE OF MEETING HER AGAIN.  HER
POWER WITH HIM WAS GONE FOR EVER.

IT WAS NOW HIS OBJECT TO MARRY.  HE WAS RICH, AND BEING TURNED ON
SHORE, FULLY INTENDED TO SETTLE AS SOON AS HE COULD BE PROPERLY
TEMPTED; ACTUALLY LOOKING ROUND, READY TO FALL IN LOVE WITH ALL THE
SPEED WHICH A CLEAR HEAD AND A QUICK TASTE COULD ALLOW.  HE HAD A HEART
FOR EITHER OF THE MISS MUSGROVES, IF THEY COULD CATCH IT; A HEART, IN
SHORT, FOR ANY PLEASING YOUNG WOMAN WHO CAME IN HIS WAY, EXCEPTING ANNE
ELLIOT.  THIS WAS HIS ONLY SECRET EXCEPTION, WHEN HE SAID TO HIS
SISTER, IN ANSWER TO HER SUPPOSITIONS:--

"YES, HERE I AM, SOPHIA, QUITE READY TO MAKE A FOOLISH MATCH.  ANYBODY
BETWEEN FIFTEEN AND THIRTY MAY HAVE ME FOR ASKING.  A LITTLE BEAUTY,
AND A FEW SMILES, AND A FEW COMPLIMENTS TO THE NAVY, AND I AM A LOST
MAN.  SHOULD NOT THIS BE ENOUGH FOR A SAILOR, WHO HAS HAD NO SOCIETY
AMONG WOMEN TO MAKE HIM NICE?"

HE SAID IT, SHE KNEW, TO BE CONTRADICTED.  HIS BRIGHT PROUD EYE SPOKE
THE CONVICTION THAT HE WAS NICE; AND ANNE ELLIOT WAS NOT OUT OF HIS
THOUGHTS, WHEN HE MORE SERIOUSLY DESCRIBED THE WOMAN HE SHOULD WISH TO
MEET WITH.  "A STRONG MIND, WITH SWEETNESS OF MANNER," MADE THE FIRST
AND THE LAST OF THE DESCRIPTION.

"THAT IS THE WOMAN I WANT," SAID HE.  "SOMETHING A LITTLE INFERIOR I
SHALL OF COURSE PUT UP WITH, BUT IT MUST NOT BE MUCH.  IF I AM A FOOL,
I SHALL BE A FOOL INDEED, FOR I HAVE THOUGHT ON THE SUBJECT MORE THAN
MOST MEN."



CHAPTER 8


FROM THIS TIME CAPTAIN WENTWORTH AND ANNE ELLIOT WERE REPEATEDLY IN THE
SAME CIRCLE.  THEY WERE SOON DINING IN COMPANY TOGETHER AT MR
MUSGROVE'S, FOR THE LITTLE BOY'S STATE COULD NO LONGER SUPPLY HIS AUNT
WITH A PRETENCE FOR ABSENTING HERSELF; AND THIS WAS BUT THE BEGINNING
OF OTHER DININGS AND OTHER MEETINGS.

WHETHER FORMER FEELINGS WERE TO BE RENEWED MUST BE BROUGHT TO THE
PROOF; FORMER TIMES MUST UNDOUBTEDLY BE BROUGHT TO THE RECOLLECTION OF
EACH; THEY COULD NOT BUT BE REVERTED TO; THE YEAR OF THEIR ENGAGEMENT
COULD NOT BUT BE NAMED BY HIM, IN THE LITTLE NARRATIVES OR DESCRIPTIONS
WHICH CONVERSATION CALLED FORTH.  HIS PROFESSION QUALIFIED HIM, HIS
DISPOSITION LEAD HIM, TO TALK; AND "THAT WAS IN THE YEAR SIX;" "THAT
HAPPENED BEFORE I WENT TO SEA IN THE YEAR SIX," OCCURRED IN THE COURSE
OF THE FIRST EVENING THEY SPENT TOGETHER: AND THOUGH HIS VOICE DID NOT
FALTER, AND THOUGH SHE HAD NO REASON TO SUPPOSE HIS EYE WANDERING
TOWARDS HER WHILE HE SPOKE, ANNE FELT THE UTTER IMPOSSIBILITY, FROM HER
KNOWLEDGE OF HIS MIND, THAT HE COULD BE UNVISITED BY REMEMBRANCE ANY
MORE THAN HERSELF.  THERE MUST BE THE SAME IMMEDIATE ASSOCIATION OF
THOUGHT, THOUGH SHE WAS VERY FAR FROM CONCEIVING IT TO BE OF EQUAL PAIN.

THEY HAD NO CONVERSATION TOGETHER, NO INTERCOURSE BUT WHAT THE
COMMONEST CIVILITY REQUIRED.  ONCE SO MUCH TO EACH OTHER!  NOW NOTHING!
THERE HAD BEEN A TIME, WHEN OF ALL THE LARGE PARTY NOW FILLING THE
DRAWING-ROOM AT UPPERCROSS, THEY WOULD HAVE FOUND IT MOST DIFFICULT TO
CEASE TO SPEAK TO ONE ANOTHER.  WITH THE EXCEPTION, PERHAPS, OF ADMIRAL
AND MRS CROFT, WHO SEEMED PARTICULARLY ATTACHED AND HAPPY, (ANNE COULD
ALLOW NO OTHER EXCEPTIONS EVEN AMONG THE MARRIED COUPLES), THERE COULD
HAVE BEEN NO TWO HEARTS SO OPEN, NO TASTES SO SIMILAR, NO FEELINGS SO
IN UNISON, NO COUNTENANCES SO BELOVED.  NOW THEY WERE AS STRANGERS;
NAY, WORSE THAN STRANGERS, FOR THEY COULD NEVER BECOME ACQUAINTED.  IT
WAS A PERPETUAL ESTRANGEMENT.

WHEN HE TALKED, SHE HEARD THE SAME VOICE, AND DISCERNED THE SAME MIND.
THERE WAS A VERY GENERAL IGNORANCE OF ALL NAVAL MATTERS THROUGHOUT THE
PARTY; AND HE WAS VERY MUCH QUESTIONED, AND ESPECIALLY BY THE TWO MISS
MUSGROVES, WHO SEEMED HARDLY TO HAVE ANY EYES BUT FOR HIM, AS TO THE
MANNER OF LIVING ON BOARD, DAILY REGULATIONS, FOOD, HOURS, ETC., AND
THEIR SURPRISE AT HIS ACCOUNTS, AT LEARNING THE DEGREE OF ACCOMMODATION
AND ARRANGEMENT WHICH WAS PRACTICABLE, DREW FROM HIM SOME PLEASANT
RIDICULE, WHICH REMINDED ANNE OF THE EARLY DAYS WHEN SHE TOO HAD BEEN
IGNORANT, AND SHE TOO HAD BEEN ACCUSED OF SUPPOSING SAILORS TO BE
LIVING ON BOARD WITHOUT ANYTHING TO EAT, OR ANY COOK TO DRESS IT IF
THERE WERE, OR ANY SERVANT TO WAIT, OR ANY KNIFE AND FORK TO USE.

FROM THUS LISTENING AND THINKING, SHE WAS ROUSED BY A WHISPER OF MRS
MUSGROVE'S WHO, OVERCOME BY FOND REGRETS, COULD NOT HELP SAYING--

"AH! MISS ANNE, IF IT HAD PLEASED HEAVEN TO SPARE MY POOR SON, I DARE
SAY HE WOULD HAVE BEEN JUST SUCH ANOTHER BY THIS TIME."

ANNE SUPPRESSED A SMILE, AND LISTENED KINDLY, WHILE MRS MUSGROVE
RELIEVED HER HEART A LITTLE MORE; AND FOR A FEW MINUTES, THEREFORE,
COULD NOT KEEP PACE WITH THE CONVERSATION OF THE OTHERS.

WHEN SHE COULD LET HER ATTENTION TAKE ITS NATURAL COURSE AGAIN, SHE
FOUND THE MISS MUSGROVES JUST FETCHING THE NAVY LIST (THEIR OWN NAVY
LIST, THE FIRST THAT HAD EVER BEEN AT UPPERCROSS), AND SITTING DOWN
TOGETHER TO PORE OVER IT, WITH THE PROFESSED VIEW OF FINDING OUT THE
SHIPS THAT CAPTAIN WENTWORTH HAD COMMANDED.

"YOUR FIRST WAS THE ASP, I REMEMBER; WE WILL LOOK FOR THE ASP."

"YOU WILL NOT FIND HER THERE.  QUITE WORN OUT AND BROKEN UP.  I WAS THE
LAST MAN WHO COMMANDED HER.  HARDLY FIT FOR SERVICE THEN.  REPORTED FIT
FOR HOME SERVICE FOR A YEAR OR TWO, AND SO I WAS SENT OFF TO THE WEST
INDIES."

THE GIRLS LOOKED ALL AMAZEMENT.

"THE ADMIRALTY," HE CONTINUED, "ENTERTAIN THEMSELVES NOW AND THEN, WITH
SENDING A FEW HUNDRED MEN TO SEA, IN A SHIP NOT FIT TO BE EMPLOYED.
BUT THEY HAVE A GREAT MANY TO PROVIDE FOR; AND AMONG THE THOUSANDS THAT
MAY JUST AS WELL GO TO THE BOTTOM AS NOT, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM TO
DISTINGUISH THE VERY SET WHO MAY BE LEAST MISSED."

"PHOO! PHOO!" CRIED THE ADMIRAL, "WHAT STUFF THESE YOUNG FELLOWS TALK!
NEVER WAS A BETTER SLOOP THAN THE ASP IN HER DAY.  FOR AN OLD BUILT
SLOOP, YOU WOULD NOT SEE HER EQUAL.  LUCKY FELLOW TO GET HER!  HE KNOWS
THERE MUST HAVE BEEN TWENTY BETTER MEN THAN HIMSELF APPLYING FOR HER AT
THE SAME TIME.  LUCKY FELLOW TO GET ANYTHING SO SOON, WITH NO MORE
INTEREST THAN HIS."

"I FELT MY LUCK, ADMIRAL, I ASSURE YOU;" REPLIED CAPTAIN WENTWORTH,
SERIOUSLY.  "I WAS AS WELL SATISFIED WITH MY APPOINTMENT AS YOU CAN
DESIRE.  IT WAS A GREAT OBJECT WITH ME AT THAT TIME TO BE AT SEA; A
VERY GREAT OBJECT, I WANTED TO BE DOING SOMETHING."

"TO BE SURE YOU DID.  WHAT SHOULD A YOUNG FELLOW LIKE YOU DO ASHORE FOR
HALF A YEAR TOGETHER?  IF A MAN HAD NOT A WIFE, HE SOON WANTS TO BE
AFLOAT AGAIN."

"BUT, CAPTAIN WENTWORTH," CRIED LOUISA, "HOW VEXED YOU MUST HAVE BEEN
WHEN YOU CAME TO THE ASP, TO SEE WHAT AN OLD THING THEY HAD GIVEN YOU."

"I KNEW PRETTY WELL WHAT SHE WAS BEFORE THAT DAY;" SAID HE, SMILING.
"I HAD NO MORE DISCOVERIES TO MAKE THAN YOU WOULD HAVE AS TO THE
FASHION AND STRENGTH OF ANY OLD PELISSE, WHICH YOU HAD SEEN LENT ABOUT
AMONG HALF YOUR ACQUAINTANCE EVER SINCE YOU COULD REMEMBER, AND WHICH
AT LAST, ON SOME VERY WET DAY, IS LENT TO YOURSELF.  AH! SHE WAS A DEAR
OLD ASP TO ME.  SHE DID ALL THAT I WANTED.  I KNEW SHE WOULD.  I KNEW
THAT WE SHOULD EITHER GO TO THE BOTTOM TOGETHER, OR THAT SHE WOULD BE
THE MAKING OF ME; AND I NEVER HAD TWO DAYS OF FOUL WEATHER ALL THE TIME
I WAS AT SEA IN HER; AND AFTER TAKING PRIVATEERS ENOUGH TO BE VERY
ENTERTAINING, I HAD THE GOOD LUCK IN MY PASSAGE HOME THE NEXT AUTUMN,
TO FALL IN WITH THE VERY FRENCH FRIGATE I WANTED.  I BROUGHT HER INTO
PLYMOUTH; AND HERE ANOTHER INSTANCE OF LUCK.  WE HAD NOT BEEN SIX HOURS
IN THE SOUND, WHEN A GALE CAME ON, WHICH LASTED FOUR DAYS AND NIGHTS,
AND WHICH WOULD HAVE DONE FOR POOR OLD ASP IN HALF THE TIME; OUR TOUCH
WITH THE GREAT NATION NOT HAVING MUCH IMPROVED OUR CONDITION.
FOUR-AND-TWENTY HOURS LATER, AND I SHOULD ONLY HAVE BEEN A GALLANT
CAPTAIN WENTWORTH, IN A SMALL PARAGRAPH AT ONE CORNER OF THE
NEWSPAPERS; AND BEING LOST IN ONLY A SLOOP, NOBODY WOULD HAVE THOUGHT
ABOUT ME." ANNE'S SHUDDERINGS WERE TO HERSELF ALONE; BUT THE MISS
MUSGROVES COULD BE AS OPEN AS THEY WERE SINCERE, IN THEIR EXCLAMATIONS
OF PITY AND HORROR.

"AND SO THEN, I SUPPOSE," SAID MRS MUSGROVE, IN A LOW VOICE, AS IF
THINKING ALOUD, "SO THEN HE WENT AWAY TO THE LACONIA, AND THERE HE MET
WITH OUR POOR BOY. CHARLES, MY DEAR," (BECKONING HIM TO HER), "DO ASK
CAPTAIN WENTWORTH WHERE IT WAS HE FIRST MET WITH YOUR POOR BROTHER.  I
ALWAYS FORGOT."

"IT WAS AT GIBRALTAR, MOTHER, I KNOW.  DICK HAD BEEN LEFT ILL AT
GIBRALTAR, WITH A RECOMMENDATION FROM HIS FORMER CAPTAIN TO CAPTAIN
WENTWORTH."

"OH! BUT, CHARLES, TELL CAPTAIN WENTWORTH, HE NEED NOT BE AFRAID OF
MENTIONING POOR DICK BEFORE ME, FOR IT WOULD BE RATHER A PLEASURE TO
HEAR HIM TALKED OF BY SUCH A GOOD FRIEND."

CHARLES, BEING SOMEWHAT MORE MINDFUL OF THE PROBABILITIES OF THE CASE,
ONLY NODDED IN REPLY, AND WALKED AWAY.

THE GIRLS WERE NOW HUNTING FOR THE LACONIA; AND CAPTAIN WENTWORTH COULD
NOT DENY HIMSELF THE PLEASURE OF TAKING THE PRECIOUS VOLUME INTO HIS
OWN HANDS TO SAVE THEM THE TROUBLE, AND ONCE MORE READ ALOUD THE LITTLE
STATEMENT OF HER NAME AND RATE, AND PRESENT NON-COMMISSIONED CLASS,
OBSERVING OVER IT THAT SHE TOO HAD BEEN ONE OF THE BEST FRIENDS MAN
EVER HAD.

"AH! THOSE WERE PLEASANT DAYS WHEN I HAD THE LACONIA!  HOW FAST I MADE
MONEY IN HER.  A FRIEND OF MINE AND I HAD SUCH A LOVELY CRUISE TOGETHER
OFF THE WESTERN ISLANDS.  POOR HARVILLE, SISTER!  YOU KNOW HOW MUCH HE
WANTED MONEY:  WORSE THAN MYSELF.  HE HAD A WIFE.  EXCELLENT FELLOW.  I
SHALL NEVER FORGET HIS HAPPINESS.  HE FELT IT ALL, SO MUCH FOR HER
SAKE.  I WISHED FOR HIM AGAIN THE NEXT SUMMER, WHEN I HAD STILL THE
SAME LUCK IN THE MEDITERRANEAN."

"AND I AM SURE, SIR," SAID MRS MUSGROVE, "IT WAS A LUCKY DAY FOR US,
WHEN YOU WERE PUT CAPTAIN INTO THAT SHIP.  WE SHALL NEVER FORGET WHAT
YOU DID."

HER FEELINGS MADE HER SPEAK LOW; AND CAPTAIN WENTWORTH, HEARING ONLY IN
PART, AND PROBABLY NOT HAVING DICK MUSGROVE AT ALL NEAR HIS THOUGHTS,
LOOKED RATHER IN SUSPENSE, AND AS IF WAITING FOR MORE.

"MY BROTHER," WHISPERED ONE OF THE GIRLS; "MAMMA IS THINKING OF POOR
RICHARD."

"POOR DEAR FELLOW!" CONTINUED MRS MUSGROVE; "HE WAS GROWN SO STEADY,
AND SUCH AN EXCELLENT CORRESPONDENT, WHILE HE WAS UNDER YOUR CARE!  AH!
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A HAPPY THING, IF HE HAD NEVER LEFT YOU.  I ASSURE
YOU, CAPTAIN WENTWORTH, WE ARE VERY SORRY HE EVER LEFT YOU."

THERE WAS A MOMENTARY EXPRESSION IN CAPTAIN WENTWORTH'S FACE AT THIS
SPEECH, A CERTAIN GLANCE OF HIS BRIGHT EYE, AND CURL OF HIS HANDSOME
MOUTH, WHICH CONVINCED ANNE, THAT INSTEAD OF SHARING IN MRS MUSGROVE'S
KIND WISHES, AS TO HER SON, HE HAD PROBABLY BEEN AT SOME PAINS TO GET
RID OF HIM; BUT IT WAS TOO TRANSIENT AN INDULGENCE OF SELF-AMUSEMENT TO
BE DETECTED BY ANY WHO UNDERSTOOD HIM LESS THAN HERSELF; IN ANOTHER
MOMENT HE WAS PERFECTLY COLLECTED AND SERIOUS, AND ALMOST INSTANTLY
AFTERWARDS COMING UP TO THE SOFA, ON WHICH SHE AND MRS MUSGROVE WERE
SITTING, TOOK A PLACE BY THE LATTER, AND ENTERED INTO CONVERSATION WITH
HER, IN A LOW VOICE, ABOUT HER SON, DOING IT WITH SO MUCH SYMPATHY AND
NATURAL GRACE, AS SHEWED THE KINDEST CONSIDERATION FOR ALL THAT WAS
REAL AND UNABSURD IN THE PARENT'S FEELINGS.

THEY WERE ACTUALLY ON THE SAME SOFA, FOR MRS MUSGROVE HAD MOST READILY
MADE ROOM FOR HIM; THEY WERE DIVIDED ONLY BY MRS MUSGROVE.  IT WAS NO
INSIGNIFICANT BARRIER, INDEED.  MRS MUSGROVE WAS OF A COMFORTABLE,
SUBSTANTIAL SIZE, INFINITELY MORE FITTED BY NATURE TO EXPRESS GOOD
CHEER AND GOOD HUMOUR, THAN TENDERNESS AND SENTIMENT; AND WHILE THE
AGITATIONS OF ANNE'S SLENDER FORM, AND PENSIVE FACE, MAY BE CONSIDERED
AS VERY COMPLETELY SCREENED, CAPTAIN WENTWORTH SHOULD BE ALLOWED SOME
CREDIT FOR THE SELF-COMMAND WITH WHICH HE ATTENDED TO HER LARGE FAT
SIGHINGS OVER THE DESTINY OF A SON, WHOM ALIVE NOBODY HAD CARED FOR.

PERSONAL SIZE AND MENTAL SORROW HAVE CERTAINLY NO NECESSARY
PROPORTIONS.  A LARGE BULKY FIGURE HAS AS GOOD A RIGHT TO BE IN DEEP
AFFLICTION, AS THE MOST GRACEFUL SET OF LIMBS IN THE WORLD.  BUT, FAIR
OR NOT FAIR, THERE ARE UNBECOMING CONJUNCTIONS, WHICH REASON WILL
PATRONIZE IN VAIN--WHICH TASTE CANNOT TOLERATE--WHICH RIDICULE WILL
SEIZE.

THE ADMIRAL, AFTER TAKING TWO OR THREE REFRESHING TURNS ABOUT THE ROOM
WITH HIS HANDS BEHIND HIM, BEING CALLED TO ORDER BY HIS WIFE, NOW CAME
UP TO CAPTAIN WENTWORTH, AND WITHOUT ANY OBSERVATION OF WHAT HE MIGHT
BE INTERRUPTING, THINKING ONLY OF HIS OWN THOUGHTS, BEGAN WITH--

"IF YOU HAD BEEN A WEEK LATER AT LISBON, LAST SPRING, FREDERICK, YOU
WOULD HAVE BEEN ASKED TO GIVE A PASSAGE TO LADY MARY GRIERSON AND HER
DAUGHTERS."

"SHOULD I?  I AM GLAD I WAS NOT A WEEK LATER THEN."

THE ADMIRAL ABUSED HIM FOR HIS WANT OF GALLANTRY.  HE DEFENDED HIMSELF;
THOUGH PROFESSING THAT HE WOULD NEVER WILLINGLY ADMIT ANY LADIES ON
BOARD A SHIP OF HIS, EXCEPTING FOR A BALL, OR A VISIT, WHICH A FEW
HOURS MIGHT COMPREHEND.

"BUT, IF I KNOW MYSELF," SAID HE, "THIS IS FROM NO WANT OF GALLANTRY
TOWARDS THEM.  IT IS RATHER FROM FEELING HOW IMPOSSIBLE IT IS, WITH ALL
ONE'S EFFORTS, AND ALL ONE'S SACRIFICES, TO MAKE THE ACCOMMODATIONS ON
BOARD SUCH AS WOMEN OUGHT TO HAVE.  THERE CAN BE NO WANT OF GALLANTRY,
ADMIRAL, IN RATING THE CLAIMS OF WOMEN TO EVERY PERSONAL COMFORT HIGH,
AND THIS IS WHAT I DO.  I HATE TO HEAR OF WOMEN ON BOARD, OR TO SEE
THEM ON BOARD; AND NO SHIP UNDER MY COMMAND SHALL EVER CONVEY A FAMILY
OF LADIES ANYWHERE, IF I CAN HELP IT."

THIS BROUGHT HIS SISTER UPON HIM.

"OH! FREDERICK!  BUT I CANNOT BELIEVE IT OF YOU.--ALL IDLE
REFINEMENT!--WOMEN MAY BE AS COMFORTABLE ON BOARD, AS IN THE BEST HOUSE
IN ENGLAND.  I BELIEVE I HAVE LIVED AS MUCH ON BOARD AS MOST WOMEN, AND
I KNOW NOTHING SUPERIOR TO THE ACCOMMODATIONS OF A MAN-OF-WAR.  I
DECLARE I HAVE NOT A COMFORT OR AN INDULGENCE ABOUT ME, EVEN AT
KELLYNCH HALL," (WITH A KIND BOW TO ANNE), "BEYOND WHAT I ALWAYS HAD IN
MOST OF THE SHIPS I HAVE LIVED IN; AND THEY HAVE BEEN FIVE ALTOGETHER."

"NOTHING TO THE PURPOSE," REPLIED HER BROTHER.  "YOU WERE LIVING WITH
YOUR HUSBAND, AND WERE THE ONLY WOMAN ON BOARD."

"BUT YOU, YOURSELF, BROUGHT MRS HARVILLE, HER SISTER, HER COUSIN, AND
THREE CHILDREN, ROUND FROM PORTSMOUTH TO PLYMOUTH.  WHERE WAS THIS
SUPERFINE, EXTRAORDINARY SORT OF GALLANTRY OF YOURS THEN?"

"ALL MERGED IN MY FRIENDSHIP, SOPHIA.  I WOULD ASSIST ANY BROTHER
OFFICER'S WIFE THAT I COULD, AND I WOULD BRING ANYTHING OF HARVILLE'S
FROM THE WORLD'S END, IF HE WANTED IT.  BUT DO NOT IMAGINE THAT I DID
NOT FEEL IT AN EVIL IN ITSELF."

"DEPEND UPON IT, THEY WERE ALL PERFECTLY COMFORTABLE."

"I MIGHT NOT LIKE THEM THE BETTER FOR THAT PERHAPS.  SUCH A NUMBER OF
WOMEN AND CHILDREN HAVE NO RIGHT TO BE COMFORTABLE ON BOARD."

"MY DEAR FREDERICK, YOU ARE TALKING QUITE IDLY.  PRAY, WHAT WOULD
BECOME OF US POOR SAILORS' WIVES, WHO OFTEN WANT TO BE CONVEYED TO ONE
PORT OR ANOTHER, AFTER OUR HUSBANDS, IF EVERYBODY HAD YOUR FEELINGS?"

"MY FEELINGS, YOU SEE, DID NOT PREVENT MY TAKING MRS HARVILLE AND ALL
HER FAMILY TO PLYMOUTH."

"BUT I HATE TO HEAR YOU TALKING SO LIKE A FINE GENTLEMAN, AND AS IF
WOMEN WERE ALL FINE LADIES, INSTEAD OF RATIONAL CREATURES.  WE NONE OF
US EXPECT TO BE IN SMOOTH WATER ALL OUR DAYS."

"AH! MY DEAR," SAID THE ADMIRAL, "WHEN HE HAD GOT A WIFE, HE WILL SING
A DIFFERENT TUNE.  WHEN HE IS MARRIED, IF WE HAVE THE GOOD LUCK TO LIVE
TO ANOTHER WAR, WE SHALL SEE HIM DO AS YOU AND I, AND A GREAT MANY
OTHERS, HAVE DONE.  WE SHALL HAVE HIM VERY THANKFUL TO ANYBODY THAT
WILL BRING HIM HIS WIFE."

"AY, THAT WE SHALL."

"NOW I HAVE DONE," CRIED CAPTAIN WENTWORTH.  "WHEN ONCE MARRIED PEOPLE
BEGIN TO ATTACK ME WITH,--'OH! YOU WILL THINK VERY DIFFERENTLY, WHEN
YOU ARE MARRIED.'  I CAN ONLY SAY, 'NO, I SHALL NOT;' AND THEN THEY SAY
AGAIN, 'YES, YOU WILL,' AND THERE IS AN END OF IT."

HE GOT UP AND MOVED AWAY.

"WHAT A GREAT TRAVELLER YOU MUST HAVE BEEN, MA'AM!" SAID MRS MUSGROVE
TO MRS CROFT.

"PRETTY WELL, MA'AM IN THE FIFTEEN YEARS OF MY MARRIAGE; THOUGH MANY
WOMEN HAVE DONE MORE.  I HAVE CROSSED THE ATLANTIC FOUR TIMES, AND HAVE
BEEN ONCE TO THE EAST INDIES, AND BACK AGAIN, AND ONLY ONCE; BESIDES
BEING IN DIFFERENT PLACES ABOUT HOME: CORK, AND LISBON, AND GIBRALTAR.
BUT I NEVER WENT BEYOND THE STREIGHTS, AND NEVER WAS IN THE WEST
INDIES.  WE DO NOT CALL BERMUDA OR BAHAMA, YOU KNOW, THE WEST INDIES."

MRS MUSGROVE HAD NOT A WORD TO SAY IN DISSENT; SHE COULD NOT ACCUSE
HERSELF OF HAVING EVER CALLED THEM ANYTHING IN THE WHOLE COURSE OF HER
LIFE.

"AND I DO ASSURE YOU, MA'AM," PURSUED MRS CROFT, "THAT NOTHING CAN
EXCEED THE ACCOMMODATIONS OF A MAN-OF-WAR; I SPEAK, YOU KNOW, OF THE
HIGHER RATES.  WHEN YOU COME TO A FRIGATE, OF COURSE, YOU ARE MORE
CONFINED; THOUGH ANY REASONABLE WOMAN MAY BE PERFECTLY HAPPY IN ONE OF
THEM; AND I CAN SAFELY SAY, THAT THE HAPPIEST PART OF MY LIFE HAS BEEN
SPENT ON BOARD A SHIP.  WHILE WE WERE TOGETHER, YOU KNOW, THERE WAS
NOTHING TO BE FEARED.  THANK GOD!  I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN BLESSED WITH
EXCELLENT HEALTH, AND NO CLIMATE DISAGREES WITH ME.  A LITTLE
DISORDERED ALWAYS THE FIRST TWENTY-FOUR HOURS OF GOING TO SEA, BUT
NEVER KNEW WHAT SICKNESS WAS AFTERWARDS.  THE ONLY TIME I EVER REALLY
SUFFERED IN BODY OR MIND, THE ONLY TIME THAT I EVER FANCIED MYSELF
UNWELL, OR HAD ANY IDEAS OF DANGER, WAS THE WINTER THAT I PASSED BY
MYSELF AT DEAL, WHEN THE ADMIRAL (CAPTAIN CROFT THEN) WAS IN THE NORTH
SEAS.  I LIVED IN PERPETUAL FRIGHT AT THAT TIME, AND HAD ALL MANNER OF
IMAGINARY COMPLAINTS FROM NOT KNOWING WHAT TO DO WITH MYSELF, OR WHEN I
SHOULD HEAR FROM HIM NEXT; BUT AS LONG AS WE COULD BE TOGETHER, NOTHING
EVER AILED ME, AND I NEVER MET WITH THE SMALLEST INCONVENIENCE."

"AYE, TO BE SURE.  YES, INDEED, OH YES!  I AM QUITE OF YOUR OPINION,
MRS CROFT," WAS MRS MUSGROVE'S HEARTY ANSWER.  "THERE IS NOTHING SO BAD
AS A SEPARATION.  I AM QUITE OF YOUR OPINION.  I KNOW WHAT IT IS, FOR
MR MUSGROVE ALWAYS ATTENDS THE ASSIZES, AND I AM SO GLAD WHEN THEY ARE
OVER, AND HE IS SAFE BACK AGAIN."

THE EVENING ENDED WITH DANCING.  ON ITS BEING PROPOSED, ANNE OFFERED
HER SERVICES, AS USUAL; AND THOUGH HER EYES WOULD SOMETIMES FILL WITH
TEARS AS SHE SAT AT THE INSTRUMENT, SHE WAS EXTREMELY GLAD TO BE
EMPLOYED, AND DESIRED NOTHING IN RETURN BUT TO BE UNOBSERVED.

IT WAS A MERRY, JOYOUS PARTY, AND NO ONE SEEMED IN HIGHER SPIRITS THAN
CAPTAIN WENTWORTH.  SHE FELT THAT HE HAD EVERY THING TO ELEVATE HIM
WHICH GENERAL ATTENTION AND DEFERENCE, AND ESPECIALLY THE ATTENTION OF
ALL THE YOUNG WOMEN, COULD DO.  THE MISS HAYTERS, THE FEMALES OF THE
FAMILY OF COUSINS ALREADY MENTIONED, WERE APPARENTLY ADMITTED TO THE
HONOUR OF BEING IN LOVE WITH HIM; AND AS FOR HENRIETTA AND LOUISA, THEY
BOTH SEEMED SO ENTIRELY OCCUPIED BY HIM, THAT NOTHING BUT THE CONTINUED
APPEARANCE OF THE MOST PERFECT GOOD-WILL BETWEEN THEMSELVES COULD HAVE
MADE IT CREDIBLE THAT THEY WERE NOT DECIDED RIVALS.  IF HE WERE A
LITTLE SPOILT BY SUCH UNIVERSAL, SUCH EAGER ADMIRATION, WHO COULD
WONDER?

THESE WERE SOME OF THE THOUGHTS WHICH OCCUPIED ANNE, WHILE HER FINGERS
WERE MECHANICALLY AT WORK, PROCEEDING FOR HALF AN HOUR TOGETHER,
EQUALLY WITHOUT ERROR, AND WITHOUT CONSCIOUSNESS.  ONCE SHE FELT THAT
HE WAS LOOKING AT HERSELF,  OBSERVING HER ALTERED FEATURES, PERHAPS,
TRYING TO TRACE IN THEM THE RUINS OF THE FACE WHICH HAD ONCE CHARMED
HIM; AND ONCE SHE KNEW THAT HE MUST HAVE SPOKEN OF HER; SHE WAS HARDLY
AWARE OF IT, TILL SHE HEARD THE ANSWER; BUT THEN SHE WAS SURE OF HIS
HAVING ASKED HIS PARTNER WHETHER MISS ELLIOT NEVER DANCED?  THE ANSWER
WAS, "OH, NO; NEVER; SHE HAS QUITE GIVEN UP DANCING.  SHE HAD RATHER
PLAY.  SHE IS NEVER TIRED OF PLAYING."  ONCE, TOO, HE SPOKE TO HER.
SHE HAD LEFT THE INSTRUMENT ON THE DANCING BEING OVER, AND HE HAD SAT
DOWN TO TRY TO MAKE OUT AN AIR WHICH HE WISHED TO GIVE THE MISS
MUSGROVES AN IDEA OF.  UNINTENTIONALLY SHE RETURNED TO THAT PART OF THE
ROOM; HE SAW HER, AND, INSTANTLY RISING, SAID, WITH STUDIED POLITENESS--

"I BEG YOUR PARDON, MADAM, THIS IS YOUR SEAT;" AND THOUGH SHE
IMMEDIATELY DREW BACK WITH A DECIDED NEGATIVE, HE WAS NOT TO BE INDUCED
TO SIT DOWN AGAIN.

ANNE DID NOT WISH FOR MORE OF SUCH LOOKS AND SPEECHES.  HIS COLD
POLITENESS, HIS CEREMONIOUS GRACE, WERE WORSE THAN ANYTHING.



CHAPTER 9


CAPTAIN WENTWORTH WAS COME TO KELLYNCH AS TO A HOME, TO STAY AS LONG AS
HE LIKED, BEING AS THOROUGHLY THE OBJECT OF THE ADMIRAL'S FRATERNAL
KINDNESS AS OF HIS WIFE'S.  HE HAD INTENDED, ON FIRST ARRIVING, TO
PROCEED VERY SOON INTO SHROPSHIRE, AND VISIT THE BROTHER SETTLED IN
THAT COUNTRY, BUT THE ATTRACTIONS OF UPPERCROSS INDUCED HIM TO PUT THIS
OFF.  THERE WAS SO MUCH OF FRIENDLINESS, AND OF FLATTERY, AND OF
EVERYTHING MOST BEWITCHING IN HIS RECEPTION THERE; THE OLD WERE SO
HOSPITABLE, THE YOUNG SO AGREEABLE, THAT HE COULD NOT BUT RESOLVE TO
REMAIN WHERE HE WAS, AND TAKE ALL THE CHARMS AND PERFECTIONS OF
EDWARD'S WIFE UPON CREDIT A LITTLE LONGER.

IT WAS SOON UPPERCROSS WITH HIM ALMOST EVERY DAY.  THE MUSGROVES COULD
HARDLY BE MORE READY TO INVITE THAN HE TO COME, PARTICULARLY IN THE
MORNING, WHEN HE HAD NO COMPANION AT HOME, FOR THE ADMIRAL AND MRS
CROFT WERE GENERALLY OUT OF DOORS TOGETHER, INTERESTING THEMSELVES IN
THEIR NEW POSSESSIONS, THEIR GRASS, AND THEIR SHEEP, AND DAWDLING ABOUT
IN A WAY NOT ENDURABLE TO A THIRD PERSON, OR DRIVING OUT IN A GIG,
LATELY ADDED TO THEIR ESTABLISHMENT.

HITHERTO THERE HAD BEEN BUT ONE OPINION OF CAPTAIN WENTWORTH AMONG THE
MUSGROVES AND THEIR DEPENDENCIES.  IT WAS UNVARYING, WARM ADMIRATION
EVERYWHERE; BUT THIS INTIMATE FOOTING WAS NOT MORE THAN ESTABLISHED,
WHEN A CERTAIN CHARLES HAYTER RETURNED AMONG THEM, TO BE A GOOD DEAL
DISTURBED BY IT, AND TO THINK CAPTAIN WENTWORTH VERY MUCH IN THE WAY.

CHARLES HAYTER WAS THE ELDEST OF ALL THE COUSINS, AND A VERY AMIABLE,
PLEASING YOUNG MAN, BETWEEN WHOM AND HENRIETTA THERE HAD BEEN A
CONSIDERABLE APPEARANCE OF ATTACHMENT PREVIOUS TO CAPTAIN WENTWORTH'S
INTRODUCTION.  HE WAS IN ORDERS; AND HAVING A CURACY IN THE
NEIGHBOURHOOD, WHERE RESIDENCE WAS NOT REQUIRED, LIVED AT HIS FATHER'S
HOUSE, ONLY TWO MILES FROM UPPERCROSS.  A SHORT ABSENCE FROM HOME HAD
LEFT HIS FAIR ONE UNGUARDED BY HIS ATTENTIONS AT THIS CRITICAL PERIOD,
AND WHEN HE CAME BACK HE HAD THE PAIN OF FINDING VERY ALTERED MANNERS,
AND OF SEEING CAPTAIN WENTWORTH.

MRS MUSGROVE AND MRS HAYTER WERE SISTERS.  THEY HAD EACH HAD MONEY, BUT
THEIR MARRIAGES HAD MADE A MATERIAL DIFFERENCE IN THEIR DEGREE OF
CONSEQUENCE.  MR HAYTER HAD SOME PROPERTY OF HIS OWN, BUT IT WAS
INSIGNIFICANT COMPARED WITH MR MUSGROVE'S; AND WHILE THE MUSGROVES WERE
IN THE FIRST CLASS OF SOCIETY IN THE COUNTRY, THE YOUNG HAYTERS WOULD,
FROM THEIR PARENTS' INFERIOR, RETIRED, AND UNPOLISHED WAY OF LIVING,
AND THEIR OWN DEFECTIVE EDUCATION, HAVE BEEN HARDLY IN ANY CLASS AT
ALL, BUT FOR THEIR CONNEXION WITH UPPERCROSS, THIS ELDEST SON OF COURSE
EXCEPTED, WHO HAD CHOSEN TO BE A SCHOLAR AND A GENTLEMAN, AND WHO WAS
VERY SUPERIOR IN CULTIVATION AND MANNERS TO ALL THE REST.

THE TWO FAMILIES HAD ALWAYS BEEN ON EXCELLENT TERMS, THERE BEING NO
PRIDE ON ONE SIDE, AND NO ENVY ON THE OTHER, AND ONLY SUCH A
CONSCIOUSNESS OF SUPERIORITY IN THE MISS MUSGROVES, AS MADE THEM
PLEASED TO IMPROVE THEIR COUSINS.  CHARLES'S ATTENTIONS TO HENRIETTA
HAD BEEN OBSERVED BY HER FATHER AND MOTHER WITHOUT ANY DISAPPROBATION.
"IT WOULD NOT BE A GREAT MATCH FOR HER; BUT IF HENRIETTA LIKED HIM,"--
AND HENRIETTA DID SEEM TO LIKE HIM.

HENRIETTA FULLY THOUGHT SO HERSELF, BEFORE CAPTAIN WENTWORTH CAME; BUT
FROM THAT TIME COUSIN CHARLES HAD BEEN VERY MUCH FORGOTTEN.

WHICH OF THE TWO SISTERS WAS PREFERRED BY CAPTAIN WENTWORTH WAS AS YET
QUITE DOUBTFUL, AS FAR AS ANNE'S OBSERVATION REACHED.  HENRIETTA WAS
PERHAPS THE PRETTIEST, LOUISA HAD THE HIGHER SPIRITS; AND SHE KNEW NOT
NOW, WHETHER THE MORE GENTLE OR THE MORE LIVELY CHARACTER WERE MOST
LIKELY TO ATTRACT HIM.

MR AND MRS MUSGROVE, EITHER FROM SEEING LITTLE, OR FROM AN ENTIRE
CONFIDENCE IN THE DISCRETION OF BOTH THEIR DAUGHTERS, AND OF ALL THE
YOUNG MEN WHO CAME NEAR THEM, SEEMED TO LEAVE EVERYTHING TO TAKE ITS
CHANCE.  THERE WAS NOT THE SMALLEST APPEARANCE OF SOLICITUDE OR REMARK
ABOUT THEM IN THE MANSION-HOUSE; BUT IT WAS DIFFERENT AT THE COTTAGE:
THE YOUNG COUPLE THERE WERE MORE DISPOSED TO SPECULATE AND WONDER; AND
CAPTAIN WENTWORTH HAD NOT BEEN ABOVE FOUR OR FIVE TIMES IN THE MISS
MUSGROVES' COMPANY, AND CHARLES HAYTER HAD BUT JUST REAPPEARED, WHEN
ANNE HAD TO LISTEN TO THE OPINIONS OF HER BROTHER AND SISTER, AS TO
WHICH WAS THE ONE LIKED BEST.  CHARLES GAVE IT FOR LOUISA, MARY FOR
HENRIETTA, BUT QUITE AGREEING THAT TO HAVE HIM MARRY EITHER COULD BE
EXTREMELY DELIGHTFUL.

CHARLES "HAD NEVER SEEN A PLEASANTER MAN IN HIS LIFE; AND FROM WHAT HE
HAD ONCE HEARD CAPTAIN WENTWORTH HIMSELF SAY, WAS VERY SURE THAT HE HAD
NOT MADE LESS THAN TWENTY THOUSAND POUNDS BY THE WAR.  HERE WAS A
FORTUNE AT ONCE; BESIDES WHICH, THERE WOULD BE THE CHANCE OF WHAT MIGHT
BE DONE IN ANY FUTURE WAR; AND HE WAS SURE CAPTAIN WENTWORTH WAS AS
LIKELY A MAN TO DISTINGUISH HIMSELF AS ANY OFFICER IN THE NAVY.  OH! IT
WOULD BE A CAPITAL MATCH FOR EITHER OF HIS SISTERS."

"UPON MY WORD IT WOULD," REPLIED MARY.  "DEAR ME!  IF HE SHOULD RISE TO
ANY VERY GREAT HONOURS!  IF HE SHOULD EVER BE MADE A BARONET!  'LADY
WENTWORTH' SOUNDS VERY WELL.  THAT WOULD BE A NOBLE THING, INDEED, FOR
HENRIETTA!  SHE WOULD TAKE PLACE OF ME THEN, AND HENRIETTA WOULD NOT
DISLIKE THAT.  SIR FREDERICK AND LADY WENTWORTH!  IT WOULD BE BUT A NEW
CREATION, HOWEVER, AND I NEVER THINK MUCH OF YOUR NEW CREATIONS."

IT SUITED MARY BEST TO THINK HENRIETTA THE ONE PREFERRED ON THE VERY
ACCOUNT OF CHARLES HAYTER, WHOSE PRETENSIONS SHE WISHED TO SEE PUT AN
END TO.  SHE LOOKED DOWN VERY DECIDEDLY UPON THE HAYTERS, AND THOUGHT
IT WOULD BE QUITE A MISFORTUNE TO HAVE THE EXISTING CONNECTION BETWEEN
THE FAMILIES RENEWED--VERY SAD FOR HERSELF AND HER CHILDREN.

"YOU KNOW," SAID SHE, "I CANNOT THINK HIM AT ALL A FIT MATCH FOR
HENRIETTA; AND CONSIDERING THE ALLIANCES WHICH THE MUSGROVES HAVE MADE,
SHE HAS NO RIGHT TO THROW HERSELF AWAY.  I DO NOT THINK ANY YOUNG WOMAN
HAS A RIGHT TO MAKE A CHOICE THAT MAY BE DISAGREEABLE AND INCONVENIENT
TO THE PRINCIPAL PART OF HER FAMILY, AND BE GIVING BAD CONNECTIONS TO
THOSE WHO HAVE NOT BEEN USED TO THEM.  AND, PRAY, WHO IS CHARLES
HAYTER?  NOTHING BUT A COUNTRY CURATE.  A MOST IMPROPER MATCH FOR MISS
MUSGROVE OF UPPERCROSS."

HER HUSBAND, HOWEVER, WOULD NOT AGREE WITH HER HERE; FOR BESIDES HAVING
A REGARD FOR HIS COUSIN, CHARLES HAYTER WAS AN ELDEST SON, AND HE SAW
THINGS AS AN ELDEST SON HIMSELF.

"NOW YOU ARE TALKING NONSENSE, MARY," WAS THEREFORE HIS ANSWER.  "IT
WOULD NOT BE A GREAT MATCH FOR HENRIETTA, BUT CHARLES HAS A VERY FAIR
CHANCE, THROUGH THE SPICERS, OF GETTING SOMETHING FROM THE BISHOP IN
THE COURSE OF A YEAR OR TWO; AND YOU WILL PLEASE TO REMEMBER, THAT HE
IS THE ELDEST SON; WHENEVER MY UNCLE DIES, HE STEPS INTO VERY PRETTY
PROPERTY.  THE ESTATE AT WINTHROP IS NOT LESS THAN TWO HUNDRED AND
FIFTY ACRES, BESIDES THE FARM NEAR TAUNTON, WHICH IS SOME OF THE BEST
LAND IN THE COUNTRY.  I GRANT YOU, THAT ANY OF THEM BUT CHARLES WOULD
BE A VERY SHOCKING MATCH FOR HENRIETTA, AND INDEED IT COULD NOT BE; HE
IS THE ONLY ONE THAT COULD BE POSSIBLE; BUT HE IS A VERY GOOD-NATURED,
GOOD SORT OF A FELLOW; AND WHENEVER WINTHROP COMES INTO HIS HANDS, HE
WILL MAKE A DIFFERENT SORT OF PLACE OF IT, AND LIVE IN A VERY DIFFERENT
SORT OF WAY; AND WITH THAT PROPERTY, HE WILL NEVER BE A CONTEMPTIBLE
MAN--GOOD, FREEHOLD PROPERTY.  NO, NO; HENRIETTA MIGHT DO WORSE THAN
MARRY CHARLES HAYTER; AND IF SHE HAS HIM, AND LOUISA CAN GET CAPTAIN
WENTWORTH, I SHALL BE VERY WELL SATISFIED."

"CHARLES MAY SAY WHAT HE PLEASES," CRIED MARY TO ANNE, AS SOON AS HE
WAS OUT OF THE ROOM, "BUT IT WOULD BE SHOCKING TO HAVE HENRIETTA MARRY
CHARLES HAYTER; A VERY BAD THING FOR HER, AND STILL WORSE FOR ME; AND
THEREFORE IT IS VERY MUCH TO BE WISHED THAT CAPTAIN WENTWORTH MAY SOON
PUT HIM QUITE OUT OF HER HEAD, AND I HAVE VERY LITTLE DOUBT THAT HE
HAS.  SHE TOOK HARDLY ANY NOTICE OF CHARLES HAYTER YESTERDAY.  I WISH
YOU HAD BEEN THERE TO SEE HER BEHAVIOUR.  AND AS TO CAPTAIN WENTWORTH'S
LIKING LOUISA AS WELL AS HENRIETTA, IT IS NONSENSE TO SAY SO; FOR HE
CERTAINLY DOES LIKE HENRIETTA A GREAT DEAL THE BEST.  BUT CHARLES IS SO
POSITIVE!  I WISH YOU HAD BEEN WITH US YESTERDAY, FOR THEN YOU MIGHT
HAVE DECIDED BETWEEN US; AND I AM SURE YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT AS I DID,
UNLESS YOU HAD BEEN DETERMINED TO GIVE IT AGAINST ME."

A DINNER AT MR MUSGROVE'S HAD BEEN THE OCCASION WHEN ALL THESE THINGS
SHOULD HAVE BEEN SEEN BY ANNE; BUT SHE HAD STAID AT HOME, UNDER THE
MIXED PLEA OF A HEADACHE OF HER OWN, AND SOME RETURN OF INDISPOSITION
IN LITTLE CHARLES.  SHE HAD THOUGHT ONLY OF AVOIDING CAPTAIN WENTWORTH;
BUT AN ESCAPE FROM BEING APPEALED TO AS UMPIRE WAS NOW ADDED TO THE
ADVANTAGES OF A QUIET EVENING.

AS TO CAPTAIN WENTWORTH'S VIEWS, SHE DEEMED IT OF MORE CONSEQUENCE THAT
HE SHOULD KNOW HIS OWN MIND EARLY ENOUGH NOT TO BE ENDANGERING THE
HAPPINESS OF EITHER SISTER, OR IMPEACHING HIS OWN HONOUR, THAN THAT HE
SHOULD PREFER HENRIETTA TO LOUISA, OR LOUISA TO HENRIETTA.  EITHER OF
THEM WOULD, IN ALL PROBABILITY, MAKE HIM AN AFFECTIONATE, GOOD-HUMOURED
WIFE.  WITH REGARD TO CHARLES HAYTER, SHE HAD DELICACY WHICH MUST BE
PAINED BY ANY LIGHTNESS OF CONDUCT IN A WELL-MEANING YOUNG WOMAN, AND A
HEART TO SYMPATHIZE IN ANY OF THE SUFFERINGS IT OCCASIONED; BUT IF
HENRIETTA FOUND HERSELF MISTAKEN IN THE NATURE OF HER FEELINGS, THE
ALTERNATION COULD NOT BE UNDERSTOOD TOO SOON.

CHARLES HAYTER HAD MET WITH MUCH TO DISQUIET AND MORTIFY HIM IN HIS
COUSIN'S BEHAVIOUR.  SHE HAD TOO OLD A REGARD FOR HIM TO BE SO WHOLLY
ESTRANGED AS MIGHT IN TWO MEETINGS EXTINGUISH EVERY PAST HOPE, AND
LEAVE HIM NOTHING TO DO BUT TO KEEP AWAY FROM UPPERCROSS:  BUT THERE
WAS SUCH A CHANGE AS BECAME VERY ALARMING, WHEN SUCH A MAN AS CAPTAIN
WENTWORTH WAS TO BE REGARDED AS THE PROBABLE CAUSE.  HE HAD BEEN ABSENT
ONLY TWO SUNDAYS, AND WHEN THEY PARTED, HAD LEFT HER INTERESTED, EVEN
TO THE HEIGHT OF HIS WISHES, IN HIS PROSPECT OF SOON QUITTING HIS
PRESENT CURACY, AND OBTAINING THAT OF UPPERCROSS INSTEAD.  IT HAD THEN
SEEMED THE OBJECT NEAREST HER HEART, THAT DR SHIRLEY, THE RECTOR, WHO
FOR MORE THAN FORTY YEARS HAD BEEN ZEALOUSLY DISCHARGING ALL THE DUTIES
OF HIS OFFICE, BUT WAS NOW GROWING TOO INFIRM FOR MANY OF THEM, SHOULD
BE QUITE FIXED ON ENGAGING A CURATE; SHOULD MAKE HIS CURACY QUITE AS
GOOD AS HE COULD AFFORD, AND SHOULD GIVE CHARLES HAYTER THE PROMISE OF
IT.  THE ADVANTAGE OF HIS HAVING TO COME ONLY TO UPPERCROSS, INSTEAD OF
GOING SIX MILES ANOTHER WAY; OF HIS HAVING, IN EVERY RESPECT, A BETTER
CURACY; OF HIS BELONGING TO THEIR DEAR DR SHIRLEY, AND OF DEAR, GOOD DR
SHIRLEY'S BEING RELIEVED FROM THE DUTY WHICH HE COULD NO LONGER GET
THROUGH WITHOUT MOST INJURIOUS FATIGUE, HAD BEEN A GREAT DEAL, EVEN TO
LOUISA, BUT HAD BEEN ALMOST EVERYTHING TO HENRIETTA.  WHEN HE CAME
BACK, ALAS!  THE ZEAL OF THE BUSINESS WAS GONE BY.  LOUISA COULD NOT
LISTEN AT ALL TO HIS ACCOUNT OF A CONVERSATION WHICH HE HAD JUST HELD
WITH DR SHIRLEY: SHE WAS AT A WINDOW, LOOKING OUT FOR CAPTAIN
WENTWORTH; AND EVEN HENRIETTA HAD AT BEST ONLY A DIVIDED ATTENTION TO
GIVE, AND SEEMED TO HAVE FORGOTTEN ALL THE FORMER DOUBT AND SOLICITUDE
OF THE NEGOTIATION.

"WELL, I AM VERY GLAD INDEED:  BUT I ALWAYS THOUGHT YOU WOULD HAVE IT;
I ALWAYS THOUGHT YOU SURE.  IT DID NOT APPEAR TO ME THAT--IN SHORT, YOU
KNOW, DR SHIRLEY MUST HAVE A CURATE, AND YOU HAD SECURED HIS PROMISE.
IS HE COMING, LOUISA?"

ONE MORNING, VERY SOON AFTER THE DINNER AT THE MUSGROVES, AT WHICH ANNE
HAD NOT BEEN PRESENT, CAPTAIN WENTWORTH WALKED INTO THE DRAWING-ROOM AT
THE COTTAGE, WHERE WERE ONLY HERSELF AND THE LITTLE INVALID CHARLES,
WHO WAS LYING ON THE SOFA.

THE SURPRISE OF FINDING HIMSELF ALMOST ALONE WITH ANNE ELLIOT, DEPRIVED
HIS MANNERS OF THEIR USUAL COMPOSURE:  HE STARTED, AND COULD ONLY SAY,
"I THOUGHT THE MISS MUSGROVES HAD BEEN HERE: MRS MUSGROVE TOLD ME I
SHOULD FIND THEM HERE," BEFORE HE WALKED TO THE WINDOW TO RECOLLECT
HIMSELF, AND FEEL HOW HE OUGHT TO BEHAVE.

"THEY ARE UP STAIRS WITH MY SISTER:  THEY WILL BE DOWN IN A FEW
MOMENTS, I DARE SAY," HAD BEEN ANNE'S REPLY, IN ALL THE CONFUSION THAT
WAS NATURAL; AND IF THE CHILD HAD NOT CALLED HER TO COME AND DO
SOMETHING FOR HIM, SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN OUT OF THE ROOM THE NEXT MOMENT,
AND RELEASED CAPTAIN WENTWORTH AS WELL AS HERSELF.

HE CONTINUED AT THE WINDOW; AND AFTER CALMLY AND POLITELY SAYING, "I
HOPE THE LITTLE BOY IS BETTER," WAS SILENT.

SHE WAS OBLIGED TO KNEEL DOWN BY THE SOFA, AND REMAIN THERE TO SATISFY
HER PATIENT; AND THUS THEY CONTINUED A FEW MINUTES, WHEN, TO HER VERY
GREAT SATISFACTION, SHE HEARD SOME OTHER PERSON CROSSING THE LITTLE
VESTIBULE.  SHE HOPED, ON TURNING HER HEAD, TO SEE THE MASTER OF THE
HOUSE; BUT IT PROVED TO BE ONE MUCH LESS CALCULATED FOR MAKING MATTERS
EASY--CHARLES HAYTER, PROBABLY NOT AT ALL BETTER PLEASED BY THE SIGHT
OF CAPTAIN WENTWORTH THAN CAPTAIN WENTWORTH HAD BEEN BY THE SIGHT OF
ANNE.

SHE ONLY ATTEMPTED TO SAY, "HOW DO YOU DO?  WILL YOU NOT SIT DOWN?  THE
OTHERS WILL BE HERE PRESENTLY."

CAPTAIN WENTWORTH, HOWEVER, CAME FROM HIS WINDOW, APPARENTLY NOT
ILL-DISPOSED FOR CONVERSATION; BUT CHARLES HAYTER SOON PUT AN END TO
HIS ATTEMPTS BY SEATING HIMSELF NEAR THE TABLE, AND TAKING UP THE
NEWSPAPER; AND CAPTAIN WENTWORTH RETURNED TO HIS WINDOW.

ANOTHER MINUTE BROUGHT ANOTHER ADDITION.  THE YOUNGER BOY, A REMARKABLE
STOUT, FORWARD CHILD, OF TWO YEARS OLD, HAVING GOT THE DOOR OPENED FOR
HIM BY SOME ONE WITHOUT, MADE HIS DETERMINED APPEARANCE AMONG THEM, AND
WENT STRAIGHT TO THE SOFA TO SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON, AND PUT IN HIS
CLAIM TO ANYTHING GOOD THAT MIGHT BE GIVING AWAY.

THERE BEING NOTHING TO EAT, HE COULD ONLY HAVE SOME PLAY; AND AS HIS
AUNT WOULD NOT LET HIM TEASE HIS SICK BROTHER, HE BEGAN TO FASTEN
HIMSELF UPON HER, AS SHE KNELT, IN SUCH A WAY THAT, BUSY AS SHE WAS
ABOUT CHARLES, SHE COULD NOT SHAKE HIM OFF.  SHE SPOKE TO HIM, ORDERED,
ENTREATED, AND INSISTED IN VAIN.  ONCE SHE DID CONTRIVE TO PUSH HIM
AWAY, BUT THE BOY HAD THE GREATER PLEASURE IN GETTING UPON HER BACK
AGAIN DIRECTLY.

"WALTER," SAID SHE, "GET DOWN THIS MOMENT.  YOU ARE EXTREMELY
TROUBLESOME.  I AM VERY ANGRY WITH YOU."

"WALTER," CRIED CHARLES HAYTER, "WHY DO YOU NOT DO AS YOU ARE BID?  DO
NOT YOU HEAR YOUR AUNT SPEAK?  COME TO ME, WALTER, COME TO COUSIN
CHARLES."

BUT NOT A BIT DID WALTER STIR.

IN ANOTHER MOMENT, HOWEVER, SHE FOUND HERSELF IN THE STATE OF BEING
RELEASED FROM HIM; SOME ONE WAS TAKING HIM FROM HER, THOUGH HE HAD BENT
DOWN HER HEAD SO MUCH, THAT HIS LITTLE STURDY HANDS WERE UNFASTENED
FROM AROUND HER NECK, AND HE WAS RESOLUTELY BORNE AWAY, BEFORE SHE KNEW
THAT CAPTAIN WENTWORTH HAD DONE IT.

HER SENSATIONS ON THE DISCOVERY MADE HER PERFECTLY SPEECHLESS.  SHE
COULD NOT EVEN THANK HIM.  SHE COULD ONLY HANG OVER LITTLE CHARLES,
WITH MOST DISORDERED FEELINGS.  HIS KINDNESS IN STEPPING FORWARD TO HER
RELIEF, THE MANNER, THE SILENCE IN WHICH IT HAD PASSED, THE LITTLE
PARTICULARS OF THE CIRCUMSTANCE, WITH THE CONVICTION SOON FORCED ON HER
BY THE NOISE HE WAS STUDIOUSLY MAKING WITH THE CHILD, THAT HE MEANT TO
AVOID HEARING HER THANKS, AND RATHER SOUGHT TO TESTIFY THAT HER
CONVERSATION WAS THE LAST OF HIS WANTS, PRODUCED SUCH A CONFUSION OF
VARYING, BUT VERY PAINFUL AGITATION, AS SHE COULD NOT RECOVER FROM,
TILL ENABLED BY THE ENTRANCE OF MARY AND THE MISS MUSGROVES TO MAKE
OVER HER LITTLE PATIENT TO THEIR CARES, AND LEAVE THE ROOM.  SHE COULD
NOT STAY.  IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN AN OPPORTUNITY OF WATCHING THE LOVES AND
JEALOUSIES OF THE FOUR--THEY WERE NOW ALTOGETHER; BUT SHE COULD STAY
FOR NONE OF IT.  IT WAS EVIDENT THAT CHARLES HAYTER WAS NOT WELL
INCLINED TOWARDS CAPTAIN WENTWORTH.  SHE HAD A STRONG IMPRESSION OF HIS
HAVING SAID, IN A VEXT TONE OF VOICE, AFTER CAPTAIN WENTWORTH'S
INTERFERENCE, "YOU OUGHT TO HAVE MINDED ME, WALTER; I TOLD YOU NOT TO
TEAZE YOUR AUNT;" AND COULD COMPREHEND HIS REGRETTING THAT CAPTAIN
WENTWORTH SHOULD DO WHAT HE OUGHT TO HAVE DONE HIMSELF.  BUT NEITHER
CHARLES HAYTER'S FEELINGS, NOR ANYBODY'S FEELINGS, COULD INTEREST HER,
TILL SHE HAD A LITTLE BETTER ARRANGED HER OWN.  SHE WAS ASHAMED OF
HERSELF, QUITE ASHAMED OF BEING SO NERVOUS, SO OVERCOME BY SUCH A
TRIFLE; BUT SO IT WAS, AND IT REQUIRED A LONG APPLICATION OF SOLITUDE
AND REFLECTION TO RECOVER HER.



CHAPTER 10


OTHER OPPORTUNITIES OF MAKING HER OBSERVATIONS COULD NOT FAIL TO OCCUR.
ANNE HAD SOON BEEN IN COMPANY WITH ALL THE FOUR TOGETHER OFTEN ENOUGH
TO HAVE AN OPINION, THOUGH TOO WISE TO ACKNOWLEDGE AS MUCH AT HOME,
WHERE SHE KNEW IT WOULD HAVE SATISFIED NEITHER HUSBAND NOR WIFE; FOR
WHILE SHE CONSIDERED LOUISA TO BE RATHER THE FAVOURITE, SHE COULD NOT
BUT THINK, AS FAR AS SHE MIGHT DARE TO JUDGE FROM MEMORY AND
EXPERIENCE, THAT CAPTAIN WENTWORTH WAS NOT IN LOVE WITH EITHER.  THEY
WERE MORE IN LOVE WITH HIM; YET THERE IT WAS NOT LOVE.  IT WAS A LITTLE
FEVER OF ADMIRATION; BUT IT MIGHT, PROBABLY MUST, END IN LOVE WITH
SOME.  CHARLES HAYTER SEEMED AWARE OF BEING SLIGHTED, AND YET HENRIETTA
HAD SOMETIMES THE AIR OF BEING DIVIDED BETWEEN THEM.  ANNE LONGED FOR
THE POWER OF REPRESENTING TO THEM ALL WHAT THEY WERE ABOUT, AND OF
POINTING OUT SOME OF THE EVILS THEY WERE EXPOSING THEMSELVES TO.  SHE
DID NOT ATTRIBUTE GUILE TO ANY.  IT WAS THE HIGHEST SATISFACTION TO HER
TO BELIEVE CAPTAIN WENTWORTH NOT IN THE LEAST AWARE OF THE PAIN HE WAS
OCCASIONING.  THERE WAS NO TRIUMPH, NO PITIFUL TRIUMPH IN HIS MANNER.
HE HAD, PROBABLY, NEVER HEARD, AND NEVER THOUGHT OF ANY CLAIMS OF
CHARLES HAYTER.  HE WAS ONLY WRONG IN ACCEPTING THE ATTENTIONS (FOR
ACCEPTING MUST BE THE WORD) OF TWO YOUNG WOMEN AT ONCE.

AFTER A SHORT STRUGGLE, HOWEVER, CHARLES HAYTER SEEMED TO QUIT THE
FIELD.  THREE DAYS HAD PASSED WITHOUT HIS COMING ONCE TO UPPERCROSS; A
MOST DECIDED CHANGE.  HE HAD EVEN REFUSED ONE REGULAR INVITATION TO
DINNER; AND HAVING BEEN FOUND ON THE OCCASION BY MR MUSGROVE WITH SOME
LARGE BOOKS BEFORE HIM, MR AND MRS MUSGROVE WERE SURE ALL COULD NOT BE
RIGHT, AND TALKED, WITH GRAVE FACES, OF HIS STUDYING HIMSELF TO DEATH.
IT WAS MARY'S HOPE AND BELIEF THAT HE HAD RECEIVED A POSITIVE DISMISSAL
FROM HENRIETTA, AND HER HUSBAND LIVED UNDER THE CONSTANT DEPENDENCE OF
SEEING HIM TO-MORROW.  ANNE COULD ONLY FEEL THAT CHARLES HAYTER WAS
WISE.

ONE MORNING, ABOUT THIS TIME CHARLES MUSGROVE AND CAPTAIN WENTWORTH
BEING GONE A-SHOOTING TOGETHER, AS THE SISTERS IN THE COTTAGE WERE
SITTING QUIETLY AT WORK, THEY WERE VISITED AT THE WINDOW BY THE SISTERS
FROM THE MANSION-HOUSE.

IT WAS A VERY FINE NOVEMBER DAY, AND THE MISS MUSGROVES CAME THROUGH
THE LITTLE GROUNDS, AND STOPPED FOR NO OTHER PURPOSE THAN TO SAY, THAT
THEY WERE GOING TO TAKE A LONG WALK, AND THEREFORE CONCLUDED MARY COULD
NOT LIKE TO GO WITH THEM; AND WHEN MARY IMMEDIATELY REPLIED, WITH SOME
JEALOUSY AT NOT BEING SUPPOSED A GOOD WALKER, "OH, YES, I SHOULD LIKE
TO JOIN YOU VERY MUCH, I AM VERY FOND OF A LONG WALK;" ANNE FELT
PERSUADED, BY THE LOOKS OF THE TWO GIRLS, THAT IT WAS PRECISELY WHAT
THEY DID NOT WISH, AND ADMIRED AGAIN THE SORT OF NECESSITY WHICH THE
FAMILY HABITS SEEMED TO PRODUCE, OF EVERYTHING BEING TO BE
COMMUNICATED, AND EVERYTHING BEING TO BE DONE TOGETHER, HOWEVER
UNDESIRED AND INCONVENIENT.  SHE TRIED TO DISSUADE MARY FROM GOING, BUT
IN VAIN; AND THAT BEING THE CASE, THOUGHT IT BEST TO ACCEPT THE MISS
MUSGROVES' MUCH MORE CORDIAL INVITATION TO HERSELF TO GO LIKEWISE, AS
SHE MIGHT BE USEFUL IN TURNING BACK WITH HER SISTER, AND LESSENING THE
INTERFERENCE IN ANY PLAN OF THEIR OWN.

"I CANNOT IMAGINE WHY THEY SHOULD SUPPOSE I SHOULD NOT LIKE A LONG
WALK," SAID MARY, AS SHE WENT UP STAIRS.  "EVERYBODY IS ALWAYS
SUPPOSING THAT I AM NOT A GOOD WALKER; AND YET THEY WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN
PLEASED, IF WE HAD REFUSED TO JOIN THEM.  WHEN PEOPLE COME IN THIS
MANNER ON PURPOSE TO ASK US, HOW CAN ONE SAY NO?"

JUST AS THEY WERE SETTING OFF, THE GENTLEMEN RETURNED.  THEY HAD TAKEN
OUT A YOUNG DOG, WHO HAD SPOILT THEIR SPORT, AND SENT THEM BACK EARLY.
THEIR TIME AND STRENGTH, AND SPIRITS, WERE, THEREFORE, EXACTLY READY
FOR THIS WALK, AND THEY ENTERED INTO IT WITH PLEASURE.  COULD ANNE HAVE
FORESEEN SUCH A JUNCTION, SHE WOULD HAVE STAID AT HOME; BUT, FROM SOME
FEELINGS OF INTEREST AND CURIOSITY, SHE FANCIED NOW THAT IT WAS TOO
LATE TO RETRACT, AND THE WHOLE SIX SET FORWARD TOGETHER IN THE
DIRECTION CHOSEN BY THE MISS MUSGROVES, WHO EVIDENTLY CONSIDERED THE
WALK AS UNDER THEIR GUIDANCE.

ANNE'S OBJECT WAS, NOT TO BE IN THE WAY OF ANYBODY; AND WHERE THE
NARROW PATHS ACROSS THE FIELDS MADE MANY SEPARATIONS NECESSARY, TO KEEP
WITH HER BROTHER AND SISTER.  HER PLEASURE IN THE WALK MUST ARISE FROM
THE EXERCISE AND THE DAY, FROM THE VIEW OF THE LAST SMILES OF THE YEAR
UPON THE TAWNY LEAVES, AND WITHERED HEDGES, AND FROM REPEATING TO
HERSELF SOME FEW OF THE THOUSAND POETICAL DESCRIPTIONS EXTANT OF
AUTUMN, THAT SEASON OF PECULIAR AND INEXHAUSTIBLE INFLUENCE ON THE MIND
OF TASTE AND TENDERNESS, THAT SEASON WHICH HAD DRAWN FROM EVERY POET,
WORTHY OF BEING READ, SOME ATTEMPT AT DESCRIPTION, OR SOME LINES OF
FEELING.  SHE OCCUPIED HER MIND AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE IN SUCH LIKE
MUSINGS AND QUOTATIONS; BUT IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE, THAT WHEN WITHIN REACH
OF CAPTAIN WENTWORTH'S CONVERSATION WITH EITHER OF THE MISS MUSGROVES,
SHE SHOULD NOT TRY TO HEAR IT; YET SHE CAUGHT LITTLE VERY REMARKABLE.
IT WAS MERE LIVELY CHAT, SUCH AS ANY YOUNG PERSONS, ON AN INTIMATE
FOOTING, MIGHT FALL INTO.  HE WAS MORE ENGAGED WITH LOUISA THAN WITH
HENRIETTA.  LOUISA CERTAINLY PUT MORE FORWARD FOR HIS NOTICE THAN HER
SISTER.  THIS DISTINCTION APPEARED TO INCREASE, AND THERE WAS ONE
SPEECH OF LOUISA'S WHICH STRUCK HER.  AFTER ONE OF THE MANY PRAISES OF
THE DAY, WHICH WERE CONTINUALLY BURSTING FORTH, CAPTAIN WENTWORTH
ADDED:--

"WHAT GLORIOUS WEATHER FOR THE ADMIRAL AND MY SISTER!  THEY MEANT TO
TAKE A LONG DRIVE THIS MORNING; PERHAPS WE MAY HAIL THEM FROM SOME OF
THESE HILLS.  THEY TALKED OF COMING INTO THIS SIDE OF THE COUNTRY.  I
WONDER WHEREABOUTS THEY WILL UPSET TO-DAY.  OH! IT DOES HAPPEN VERY
OFTEN, I ASSURE YOU; BUT MY SISTER MAKES NOTHING OF IT; SHE WOULD AS
LIEVE BE TOSSED OUT AS NOT."

"AH! YOU MAKE THE MOST OF IT, I KNOW," CRIED LOUISA, "BUT IF IT WERE
REALLY SO, I SHOULD DO JUST THE SAME IN HER PLACE.  IF I LOVED A MAN,
AS SHE LOVES THE ADMIRAL, I WOULD ALWAYS BE WITH HIM, NOTHING SHOULD
EVER SEPARATE US, AND I WOULD RATHER BE OVERTURNED BY HIM, THAN DRIVEN
SAFELY BY ANYBODY ELSE."

IT WAS SPOKEN WITH ENTHUSIASM.

"HAD YOU?" CRIED HE, CATCHING THE SAME TONE; "I HONOUR YOU!" AND THERE
WAS SILENCE BETWEEN THEM FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

ANNE COULD NOT IMMEDIATELY FALL INTO A QUOTATION AGAIN.  THE SWEET
SCENES OF AUTUMN WERE FOR A WHILE PUT BY, UNLESS SOME TENDER SONNET,
FRAUGHT WITH THE APT ANALOGY OF THE DECLINING YEAR, WITH DECLINING
HAPPINESS, AND THE IMAGES OF YOUTH AND HOPE, AND SPRING, ALL GONE
TOGETHER, BLESSED HER MEMORY.  SHE ROUSED HERSELF TO SAY, AS THEY
STRUCK BY ORDER INTO ANOTHER PATH, "IS NOT THIS ONE OF THE WAYS TO
WINTHROP?" BUT NOBODY HEARD, OR, AT LEAST, NOBODY ANSWERED HER.

WINTHROP, HOWEVER, OR ITS ENVIRONS--FOR YOUNG MEN ARE, SOMETIMES TO BE
MET WITH, STROLLING ABOUT NEAR HOME--WAS THEIR DESTINATION; AND AFTER
ANOTHER HALF MILE OF GRADUAL ASCENT THROUGH LARGE ENCLOSURES, WHERE THE
PLOUGHS AT WORK, AND THE FRESH MADE PATH SPOKE THE FARMER COUNTERACTING
THE SWEETS OF POETICAL DESPONDENCE, AND MEANING TO HAVE SPRING AGAIN,
THEY GAINED THE SUMMIT OF THE MOST CONSIDERABLE HILL, WHICH PARTED
UPPERCROSS AND WINTHROP, AND SOON COMMANDED A FULL VIEW OF THE LATTER,
AT THE FOOT OF THE HILL ON THE OTHER SIDE.

WINTHROP, WITHOUT BEAUTY AND WITHOUT DIGNITY, WAS STRETCHED BEFORE THEM
AN INDIFFERENT HOUSE, STANDING LOW, AND HEMMED IN BY THE BARNS AND
BUILDINGS OF A FARM-YARD.

MARY EXCLAIMED, "BLESS ME! HERE IS WINTHROP.  I DECLARE I HAD NO IDEA!
WELL NOW, I THINK WE HAD BETTER TURN BACK; I AM EXCESSIVELY TIRED."

HENRIETTA, CONSCIOUS AND ASHAMED, AND SEEING NO COUSIN CHARLES WALKING
ALONG ANY PATH, OR LEANING AGAINST ANY GATE, WAS READY TO DO AS MARY
WISHED; BUT "NO!" SAID CHARLES MUSGROVE, AND "NO, NO!" CRIED LOUISA
MORE EAGERLY, AND TAKING HER SISTER ASIDE, SEEMED TO BE ARGUING THE
MATTER WARMLY.

CHARLES, IN THE MEANWHILE, WAS VERY DECIDEDLY DECLARING HIS RESOLUTION
OF CALLING ON HIS AUNT, NOW THAT HE WAS SO NEAR; AND VERY EVIDENTLY,
THOUGH MORE FEARFULLY, TRYING TO INDUCE HIS WIFE TO GO TOO.  BUT THIS
WAS ONE OF THE POINTS ON WHICH THE LADY SHEWED HER STRENGTH; AND WHEN
HE RECOMMENDED THE ADVANTAGE OF RESTING HERSELF A QUARTER OF AN HOUR AT
WINTHROP, AS SHE FELT SO TIRED, SHE RESOLUTELY ANSWERED, "OH! NO,
INDEED! WALKING UP THAT HILL AGAIN WOULD DO HER MORE HARM THAN ANY
SITTING DOWN COULD DO HER GOOD;" AND, IN SHORT, HER LOOK AND MANNER
DECLARED, THAT GO SHE WOULD NOT.

AFTER A LITTLE SUCCESSION OF THESE SORT OF DEBATES AND CONSULTATIONS,
IT WAS SETTLED BETWEEN CHARLES AND HIS TWO SISTERS, THAT HE AND
HENRIETTA SHOULD JUST RUN DOWN FOR A FEW MINUTES, TO SEE THEIR AUNT AND
COUSINS, WHILE THE REST OF THE PARTY WAITED FOR THEM AT THE TOP OF THE
HILL.  LOUISA SEEMED THE PRINCIPAL ARRANGER OF THE PLAN; AND, AS SHE
WENT A LITTLE WAY WITH THEM, DOWN THE HILL, STILL TALKING TO HENRIETTA,
MARY TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY OF LOOKING SCORNFULLY AROUND HER, AND SAYING
TO CAPTAIN WENTWORTH--

"IT IS VERY UNPLEASANT, HAVING SUCH CONNEXIONS!  BUT, I ASSURE YOU, I
HAVE NEVER BEEN IN THE HOUSE ABOVE TWICE IN MY LIFE."

SHE RECEIVED NO OTHER ANSWER, THAN AN ARTIFICIAL, ASSENTING SMILE,
FOLLOWED BY A CONTEMPTUOUS GLANCE, AS HE TURNED AWAY, WHICH ANNE
PERFECTLY KNEW THE MEANING OF.

THE BROW OF THE HILL, WHERE THEY REMAINED, WAS A CHEERFUL SPOT: LOUISA
RETURNED; AND MARY, FINDING A COMFORTABLE SEAT FOR HERSELF ON THE STEP
OF A STILE, WAS VERY WELL SATISFIED SO LONG AS THE OTHERS ALL STOOD
ABOUT HER; BUT WHEN LOUISA DREW CAPTAIN WENTWORTH AWAY, TO TRY FOR A
GLEANING OF NUTS IN AN ADJOINING HEDGE-ROW, AND THEY WERE GONE BY
DEGREES QUITE OUT OF SIGHT AND SOUND, MARY WAS HAPPY NO LONGER; SHE
QUARRELLED WITH HER OWN SEAT, WAS SURE LOUISA HAD GOT A MUCH BETTER
SOMEWHERE, AND NOTHING COULD PREVENT HER FROM GOING TO LOOK FOR A
BETTER ALSO.  SHE TURNED THROUGH THE SAME GATE, BUT COULD NOT SEE THEM.
ANNE FOUND A NICE SEAT FOR HER, ON A DRY SUNNY BANK, UNDER THE
HEDGE-ROW, IN WHICH SHE HAD NO DOUBT OF THEIR STILL BEING, IN SOME SPOT
OR OTHER.  MARY SAT DOWN FOR A MOMENT, BUT IT WOULD NOT DO; SHE WAS
SURE LOUISA HAD FOUND A BETTER SEAT SOMEWHERE ELSE, AND SHE WOULD GO ON
TILL SHE OVERTOOK HER.

ANNE, REALLY TIRED HERSELF, WAS GLAD TO SIT DOWN; AND SHE VERY SOON
HEARD CAPTAIN WENTWORTH AND LOUISA IN THE HEDGE-ROW, BEHIND HER, AS IF
MAKING THEIR WAY BACK ALONG THE ROUGH, WILD SORT OF CHANNEL, DOWN THE
CENTRE.  THEY WERE SPEAKING AS THEY DREW NEAR.  LOUISA'S VOICE WAS THE
FIRST DISTINGUISHED.  SHE SEEMED TO BE IN THE MIDDLE OF SOME EAGER
SPEECH.  WHAT ANNE FIRST HEARD WAS--

"AND SO, I MADE HER GO.  I COULD NOT BEAR THAT SHE SHOULD BE FRIGHTENED
FROM THE VISIT BY SUCH NONSENSE.  WHAT! WOULD I BE TURNED BACK FROM
DOING A THING THAT I HAD DETERMINED TO DO, AND THAT I KNEW TO BE RIGHT,
BY THE AIRS AND INTERFERENCE OF SUCH A PERSON, OR OF ANY PERSON I MAY
SAY?  NO, I HAVE NO IDEA OF BEING SO EASILY PERSUADED.  WHEN I HAVE
MADE UP MY MIND, I HAVE MADE IT; AND HENRIETTA SEEMED ENTIRELY TO HAVE
MADE UP HERS TO CALL AT WINTHROP TO-DAY; AND YET, SHE WAS AS NEAR
GIVING IT UP, OUT OF NONSENSICAL COMPLAISANCE!"

"SHE WOULD HAVE TURNED BACK THEN, BUT FOR YOU?"

"SHE WOULD INDEED.  I AM ALMOST ASHAMED TO SAY IT."

"HAPPY FOR HER, TO HAVE SUCH A MIND AS YOURS AT HAND!  AFTER THE HINTS
YOU GAVE JUST NOW, WHICH DID BUT CONFIRM MY OWN OBSERVATIONS, THE LAST
TIME I WAS IN COMPANY WITH HIM,  I NEED NOT AFFECT TO HAVE NO
COMPREHENSION OF WHAT IS GOING ON.  I SEE THAT MORE THAN A MERE DUTIFUL
MORNING VISIT TO YOUR AUNT WAS IN QUESTION; AND WOE BETIDE HIM, AND HER
TOO, WHEN IT COMES TO THINGS OF CONSEQUENCE, WHEN THEY ARE PLACED IN
CIRCUMSTANCES REQUIRING FORTITUDE AND STRENGTH OF MIND, IF SHE HAVE NOT
RESOLUTION ENOUGH TO RESIST IDLE INTERFERENCE IN SUCH A TRIFLE AS THIS.
YOUR SISTER IS AN AMIABLE CREATURE; BUT YOURS IS THE CHARACTER OF
DECISION AND FIRMNESS, I SEE.  IF YOU VALUE HER CONDUCT OR HAPPINESS,
INFUSE AS MUCH OF YOUR OWN SPIRIT INTO HER AS YOU CAN.  BUT THIS, NO
DOUBT, YOU HAVE BEEN ALWAYS DOING.  IT IS THE WORST EVIL OF TOO
YIELDING AND INDECISIVE A CHARACTER, THAT NO INFLUENCE OVER IT CAN BE
DEPENDED ON.  YOU ARE NEVER SURE OF A GOOD IMPRESSION BEING DURABLE;
EVERYBODY MAY SWAY IT.  LET THOSE WHO WOULD BE HAPPY BE FIRM.  HERE IS
A NUT," SAID HE, CATCHING ONE DOWN FROM AN UPPER BOUGH, "TO EXEMPLIFY:
A BEAUTIFUL GLOSSY NUT, WHICH, BLESSED WITH ORIGINAL STRENGTH, HAS
OUTLIVED ALL THE STORMS OF AUTUMN.  NOT A PUNCTURE, NOT A WEAK SPOT
ANYWHERE.  THIS NUT," HE CONTINUED, WITH PLAYFUL SOLEMNITY, "WHILE SO
MANY OF HIS BRETHREN HAVE FALLEN AND BEEN TRODDEN UNDER FOOT, IS STILL
IN POSSESSION OF ALL THE HAPPINESS THAT A HAZEL NUT CAN BE SUPPOSED
CAPABLE OF."  THEN RETURNING TO HIS FORMER EARNEST TONE--"MY FIRST
WISH FOR ALL WHOM I AM INTERESTED IN, IS THAT THEY SHOULD BE FIRM.  IF
LOUISA MUSGROVE WOULD BE BEAUTIFUL AND HAPPY IN HER NOVEMBER OF LIFE,
SHE WILL CHERISH ALL HER PRESENT POWERS OF MIND."

HE HAD DONE, AND WAS UNANSWERED.  IT WOULD HAVE SURPRISED ANNE IF
LOUISA COULD HAVE READILY ANSWERED SUCH A SPEECH:  WORDS OF SUCH
INTEREST, SPOKEN WITH SUCH SERIOUS WARMTH!  SHE COULD IMAGINE WHAT
LOUISA WAS FEELING.  FOR HERSELF, SHE FEARED TO MOVE, LEST SHE SHOULD
BE SEEN.  WHILE SHE REMAINED, A BUSH OF LOW RAMBLING HOLLY PROTECTED
HER, AND THEY WERE MOVING ON.  BEFORE THEY WERE BEYOND HER HEARING,
HOWEVER, LOUISA SPOKE AGAIN.

"MARY IS GOOD-NATURED ENOUGH IN MANY RESPECTS," SAID SHE; "BUT SHE DOES
SOMETIMES PROVOKE ME EXCESSIVELY, BY HER NONSENSE AND PRIDE--THE ELLIOT
PRIDE.  SHE HAS A GREAT DEAL TOO MUCH OF THE ELLIOT PRIDE.  WE DO SO
WISH THAT CHARLES HAD MARRIED ANNE INSTEAD.  I SUPPOSE YOU KNOW HE
WANTED TO MARRY ANNE?"

AFTER A MOMENT'S PAUSE, CAPTAIN WENTWORTH SAID--

"DO YOU MEAN THAT SHE REFUSED HIM?"

"OH! YES; CERTAINLY."

"WHEN DID THAT HAPPEN?"

"I DO NOT EXACTLY KNOW, FOR HENRIETTA AND I WERE AT SCHOOL AT THE TIME;
BUT I BELIEVE ABOUT A YEAR BEFORE HE MARRIED MARY.  I WISH SHE HAD
ACCEPTED HIM.  WE SHOULD ALL HAVE LIKED HER A GREAT DEAL BETTER; AND
PAPA AND MAMMA ALWAYS THINK IT WAS HER GREAT FRIEND LADY RUSSELL'S
DOING, THAT SHE DID NOT.  THEY THINK CHARLES MIGHT NOT BE LEARNED AND
BOOKISH ENOUGH TO PLEASE LADY RUSSELL, AND THAT THEREFORE, SHE
PERSUADED ANNE TO REFUSE HIM."

THE SOUNDS WERE RETREATING, AND ANNE DISTINGUISHED NO MORE.  HER OWN
EMOTIONS STILL KEPT HER FIXED.  SHE HAD MUCH TO RECOVER FROM, BEFORE
SHE COULD MOVE.  THE LISTENER'S PROVERBIAL FATE WAS NOT ABSOLUTELY
HERS; SHE HAD HEARD NO EVIL OF HERSELF, BUT SHE HAD HEARD A GREAT DEAL
OF VERY PAINFUL IMPORT.  SHE SAW HOW HER OWN CHARACTER WAS CONSIDERED
BY CAPTAIN WENTWORTH, AND THERE HAD BEEN JUST THAT DEGREE OF FEELING
AND CURIOSITY ABOUT HER IN HIS MANNER WHICH MUST GIVE HER EXTREME
AGITATION.

AS SOON AS SHE COULD, SHE WENT AFTER MARY, AND HAVING FOUND, AND WALKED
BACK WITH HER TO THEIR FORMER STATION, BY THE STILE, FELT SOME COMFORT
IN THEIR WHOLE PARTY BEING IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS COLLECTED, AND ONCE
MORE IN MOTION TOGETHER.  HER SPIRITS WANTED THE SOLITUDE AND SILENCE
WHICH ONLY NUMBERS COULD GIVE.

CHARLES AND HENRIETTA RETURNED, BRINGING, AS MAY BE CONJECTURED,
CHARLES HAYTER WITH THEM.  THE MINUTIAE OF THE BUSINESS ANNE COULD NOT
ATTEMPT TO UNDERSTAND; EVEN CAPTAIN WENTWORTH DID NOT SEEM ADMITTED TO
PERFECT CONFIDENCE HERE; BUT THAT THERE HAD BEEN A WITHDRAWING ON THE
GENTLEMAN'S SIDE, AND A RELENTING ON THE LADY'S, AND THAT THEY WERE NOW
VERY GLAD TO BE TOGETHER AGAIN, DID NOT ADMIT A DOUBT.  HENRIETTA
LOOKED A LITTLE ASHAMED, BUT VERY WELL PLEASED;--CHARLES HAYTER
EXCEEDINGLY HAPPY:  AND THEY WERE DEVOTED TO EACH OTHER ALMOST FROM THE
FIRST INSTANT OF THEIR ALL SETTING FORWARD FOR UPPERCROSS.

EVERYTHING NOW MARKED OUT LOUISA FOR CAPTAIN WENTWORTH; NOTHING COULD
BE PLAINER; AND WHERE MANY DIVISIONS WERE NECESSARY, OR EVEN WHERE THEY
WERE NOT, THEY WALKED SIDE BY SIDE NEARLY AS MUCH AS THE OTHER TWO.  IN
A LONG STRIP OF MEADOW LAND, WHERE THERE WAS AMPLE SPACE FOR ALL, THEY
WERE THUS DIVIDED, FORMING THREE DISTINCT PARTIES; AND TO THAT PARTY OF
THE THREE WHICH BOASTED LEAST ANIMATION, AND LEAST COMPLAISANCE, ANNE
NECESSARILY BELONGED.  SHE JOINED CHARLES AND MARY, AND WAS TIRED
ENOUGH TO BE VERY GLAD OF CHARLES'S OTHER ARM; BUT CHARLES, THOUGH IN
VERY GOOD HUMOUR WITH HER, WAS OUT OF TEMPER WITH HIS WIFE.  MARY HAD
SHEWN HERSELF DISOBLIGING TO HIM, AND WAS NOW TO REAP THE CONSEQUENCE,
WHICH CONSEQUENCE WAS HIS DROPPING HER ARM ALMOST EVERY MOMENT TO CUT
OFF THE HEADS OF SOME NETTLES IN THE HEDGE WITH HIS SWITCH; AND WHEN
MARY BEGAN TO COMPLAIN OF IT, AND LAMENT HER BEING ILL-USED, ACCORDING
TO CUSTOM, IN BEING ON THE HEDGE SIDE, WHILE ANNE WAS NEVER INCOMMODED
ON THE OTHER, HE DROPPED THE ARMS OF BOTH TO HUNT AFTER A WEASEL WHICH
HE HAD A MOMENTARY GLANCE OF, AND THEY COULD HARDLY GET HIM ALONG AT
ALL.

THIS LONG MEADOW BORDERED A LANE, WHICH THEIR FOOTPATH, AT THE END OF
IT WAS TO CROSS, AND WHEN THE PARTY HAD ALL REACHED THE GATE OF EXIT,
THE CARRIAGE ADVANCING IN THE SAME DIRECTION, WHICH HAD BEEN SOME TIME
HEARD, WAS JUST COMING UP, AND PROVED TO BE ADMIRAL CROFT'S GIG.  HE
AND HIS WIFE HAD TAKEN THEIR INTENDED DRIVE, AND WERE RETURNING HOME.
UPON HEARING HOW LONG A WALK THE YOUNG PEOPLE HAD ENGAGED IN, THEY
KINDLY OFFERED A SEAT TO ANY LADY WHO MIGHT BE PARTICULARLY TIRED; IT
WOULD SAVE HER A FULL MILE, AND THEY WERE GOING THROUGH UPPERCROSS.
THE INVITATION WAS GENERAL, AND GENERALLY DECLINED.  THE MISS MUSGROVES
WERE NOT AT ALL TIRED, AND MARY WAS EITHER OFFENDED, BY NOT BEING ASKED
BEFORE ANY OF THE OTHERS, OR WHAT LOUISA CALLED THE ELLIOT PRIDE COULD
NOT ENDURE TO MAKE A THIRD IN A ONE HORSE CHAISE.

THE WALKING PARTY HAD CROSSED THE LANE, AND WERE SURMOUNTING AN
OPPOSITE STILE, AND THE ADMIRAL WAS PUTTING HIS HORSE IN MOTION AGAIN,
WHEN CAPTAIN WENTWORTH CLEARED THE HEDGE IN A MOMENT TO SAY SOMETHING
TO HIS SISTER.  THE SOMETHING MIGHT BE GUESSED BY ITS EFFECTS.

"MISS ELLIOT, I AM SURE YOU ARE TIRED," CRIED MRS CROFT.  "DO LET US
HAVE THE PLEASURE OF TAKING YOU HOME.  HERE IS EXCELLENT ROOM FOR
THREE, I ASSURE YOU.  IF WE WERE ALL LIKE YOU, I BELIEVE WE MIGHT SIT
FOUR.  YOU MUST, INDEED, YOU MUST."

ANNE WAS STILL IN THE LANE; AND THOUGH INSTINCTIVELY BEGINNING TO
DECLINE, SHE WAS NOT ALLOWED TO PROCEED.  THE ADMIRAL'S KIND URGENCY
CAME IN SUPPORT OF HIS WIFE'S; THEY WOULD NOT BE REFUSED; THEY
COMPRESSED THEMSELVES INTO THE SMALLEST POSSIBLE SPACE TO LEAVE HER A
CORNER, AND CAPTAIN WENTWORTH, WITHOUT SAYING A WORD, TURNED TO HER,
AND QUIETLY OBLIGED HER TO BE ASSISTED INTO THE CARRIAGE.

YES; HE HAD DONE IT.  SHE WAS IN THE CARRIAGE, AND FELT THAT HE HAD
PLACED HER THERE, THAT HIS WILL AND HIS HANDS HAD DONE IT, THAT SHE
OWED IT TO HIS PERCEPTION OF HER FATIGUE, AND HIS RESOLUTION TO GIVE
HER REST.  SHE WAS VERY MUCH AFFECTED BY THE VIEW OF HIS DISPOSITION
TOWARDS HER, WHICH ALL THESE THINGS MADE APPARENT.  THIS LITTLE
CIRCUMSTANCE SEEMED THE COMPLETION OF ALL THAT HAD GONE BEFORE.  SHE
UNDERSTOOD HIM.  HE COULD NOT FORGIVE HER, BUT HE COULD NOT BE
UNFEELING.  THOUGH CONDEMNING HER FOR THE PAST, AND CONSIDERING IT WITH
HIGH AND UNJUST RESENTMENT, THOUGH PERFECTLY CARELESS OF HER, AND
THOUGH BECOMING ATTACHED TO ANOTHER, STILL HE COULD NOT SEE HER SUFFER,
WITHOUT THE DESIRE OF GIVING HER RELIEF.  IT WAS A REMAINDER OF FORMER
SENTIMENT; IT WAS AN IMPULSE OF PURE, THOUGH UNACKNOWLEDGED FRIENDSHIP;
IT WAS A PROOF OF HIS OWN WARM AND AMIABLE HEART, WHICH SHE COULD NOT
CONTEMPLATE WITHOUT EMOTIONS SO COMPOUNDED OF PLEASURE AND PAIN, THAT
SHE KNEW NOT WHICH PREVAILED.

HER ANSWERS TO THE KINDNESS AND THE REMARKS OF HER COMPANIONS WERE AT
FIRST UNCONSCIOUSLY GIVEN.  THEY HAD TRAVELLED HALF THEIR WAY ALONG THE
ROUGH LANE, BEFORE SHE WAS QUITE AWAKE TO WHAT THEY SAID.  SHE THEN
FOUND THEM TALKING OF "FREDERICK."

"HE CERTAINLY MEANS TO HAVE ONE OR OTHER OF THOSE TWO GIRLS, SOPHY,"
SAID THE ADMIRAL; "BUT THERE IS NO SAYING WHICH.  HE HAS BEEN RUNNING
AFTER THEM, TOO, LONG ENOUGH, ONE WOULD THINK, TO MAKE UP HIS MIND.
AY, THIS COMES OF THE PEACE.  IF IT WERE WAR NOW, HE WOULD HAVE SETTLED
IT LONG AGO.  WE SAILORS, MISS ELLIOT, CANNOT AFFORD TO MAKE LONG
COURTSHIPS IN TIME OF WAR.  HOW MANY DAYS WAS IT, MY DEAR, BETWEEN THE
FIRST TIME OF MY SEEING YOU AND OUR SITTING DOWN TOGETHER IN OUR
LODGINGS AT NORTH YARMOUTH?"

"WE HAD BETTER NOT TALK ABOUT IT, MY DEAR," REPLIED MRS CROFT,
PLEASANTLY; "FOR IF MISS ELLIOT WERE TO HEAR HOW SOON WE CAME TO AN
UNDERSTANDING, SHE WOULD NEVER BE PERSUADED THAT WE COULD BE HAPPY
TOGETHER.  I HAD KNOWN YOU BY CHARACTER, HOWEVER, LONG BEFORE."

"WELL, AND I HAD HEARD OF YOU AS A VERY PRETTY GIRL, AND WHAT WERE WE
TO WAIT FOR BESIDES?  I DO NOT LIKE HAVING SUCH THINGS SO LONG IN HAND.
I WISH FREDERICK WOULD SPREAD A LITTLE MORE CANVASS, AND BRING US HOME
ONE OF THESE YOUNG LADIES TO KELLYNCH.  THEN THERE WOULD ALWAYS BE
COMPANY FOR THEM.  AND VERY NICE YOUNG LADIES THEY BOTH ARE; I HARDLY
KNOW ONE FROM THE OTHER."

"VERY GOOD HUMOURED, UNAFFECTED GIRLS, INDEED," SAID MRS CROFT, IN A
TONE OF CALMER PRAISE, SUCH AS MADE ANNE SUSPECT THAT HER KEENER POWERS
MIGHT NOT CONSIDER EITHER OF THEM AS QUITE WORTHY OF HER BROTHER; "AND
A VERY RESPECTABLE FAMILY.  ONE COULD NOT BE CONNECTED WITH BETTER
PEOPLE.  MY DEAR ADMIRAL, THAT POST!  WE SHALL CERTAINLY TAKE THAT
POST."

BUT BY COOLLY GIVING THE REINS A BETTER DIRECTION HERSELF THEY HAPPILY
PASSED THE DANGER; AND BY ONCE AFTERWARDS JUDICIOUSLY PUTTING OUT HER
HAND THEY NEITHER FELL INTO A RUT, NOR RAN FOUL OF A DUNG-CART; AND
ANNE, WITH SOME AMUSEMENT AT THEIR STYLE OF DRIVING, WHICH SHE IMAGINED
NO BAD REPRESENTATION OF THE GENERAL GUIDANCE OF THEIR AFFAIRS, FOUND
HERSELF SAFELY DEPOSITED BY THEM AT THE COTTAGE.



CHAPTER 11


THE TIME NOW APPROACHED FOR LADY RUSSELL'S RETURN:  THE DAY WAS EVEN
FIXED; AND ANNE, BEING ENGAGED TO JOIN HER AS SOON AS SHE WAS
RESETTLED, WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO AN EARLY REMOVAL TO KELLYNCH, AND
BEGINNING TO THINK HOW HER OWN COMFORT WAS LIKELY TO BE AFFECTED BY IT.

IT WOULD PLACE HER IN THE SAME VILLAGE WITH CAPTAIN WENTWORTH, WITHIN
HALF A MILE OF HIM; THEY WOULD HAVE TO FREQUENT THE SAME CHURCH, AND
THERE MUST BE INTERCOURSE BETWEEN THE TWO FAMILIES.  THIS WAS AGAINST
HER; BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, HE SPENT SO MUCH OF HIS TIME AT UPPERCROSS,
THAT IN REMOVING THENCE SHE MIGHT BE CONSIDERED RATHER AS LEAVING HIM
BEHIND, THAN AS GOING TOWARDS HIM; AND, UPON THE WHOLE, SHE BELIEVED
SHE MUST, ON THIS INTERESTING QUESTION, BE THE GAINER, ALMOST AS
CERTAINLY AS IN HER CHANGE OF DOMESTIC SOCIETY, IN LEAVING POOR MARY
FOR LADY RUSSELL.

SHE WISHED IT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE FOR HER TO AVOID EVER SEEING CAPTAIN
WENTWORTH AT THE HALL:  THOSE ROOMS HAD WITNESSED FORMER MEETINGS WHICH
WOULD BE BROUGHT TOO PAINFULLY BEFORE HER; BUT SHE WAS YET MORE ANXIOUS
FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF LADY RUSSELL AND CAPTAIN WENTWORTH NEVER MEETING
ANYWHERE.  THEY DID NOT LIKE EACH OTHER, AND NO RENEWAL OF ACQUAINTANCE
NOW COULD DO ANY GOOD; AND WERE LADY RUSSELL TO SEE THEM TOGETHER, SHE
MIGHT THINK THAT HE HAD TOO MUCH SELF-POSSESSION, AND SHE TOO LITTLE.

THESE POINTS FORMED HER CHIEF SOLICITUDE IN ANTICIPATING HER REMOVAL
FROM UPPERCROSS, WHERE SHE FELT SHE HAD BEEN STATIONED QUITE LONG
ENOUGH.  HER USEFULNESS TO LITTLE CHARLES WOULD ALWAYS GIVE SOME
SWEETNESS TO THE MEMORY OF HER TWO MONTHS' VISIT THERE, BUT HE WAS
GAINING STRENGTH APACE, AND SHE HAD NOTHING ELSE TO STAY FOR.

THE CONCLUSION OF HER VISIT, HOWEVER, WAS DIVERSIFIED IN A WAY WHICH
SHE HAD NOT AT ALL IMAGINED.  CAPTAIN WENTWORTH, AFTER BEING UNSEEN AND
UNHEARD OF AT UPPERCROSS FOR TWO WHOLE DAYS, APPEARED AGAIN AMONG THEM
TO JUSTIFY HIMSELF BY A RELATION OF WHAT HAD KEPT HIM AWAY.

A LETTER FROM HIS FRIEND, CAPTAIN HARVILLE, HAVING FOUND HIM OUT AT
LAST, HAD BROUGHT INTELLIGENCE OF CAPTAIN HARVILLE'S BEING SETTLED WITH
HIS FAMILY AT LYME FOR THE WINTER; OF THEIR BEING THEREFORE, QUITE
UNKNOWINGLY, WITHIN TWENTY MILES OF EACH OTHER.  CAPTAIN HARVILLE HAD
NEVER BEEN IN GOOD HEALTH SINCE A SEVERE WOUND WHICH HE RECEIVED TWO
YEARS BEFORE, AND CAPTAIN WENTWORTH'S ANXIETY TO SEE HIM HAD DETERMINED
HIM TO GO IMMEDIATELY TO LYME.  HE HAD BEEN THERE FOR FOUR-AND-TWENTY
HOURS.  HIS ACQUITTAL WAS COMPLETE, HIS FRIENDSHIP WARMLY HONOURED, A
LIVELY INTEREST EXCITED FOR HIS FRIEND, AND HIS DESCRIPTION OF THE FINE
COUNTRY ABOUT LYME SO FEELINGLY ATTENDED TO BY THE PARTY, THAT AN
EARNEST DESIRE TO SEE LYME THEMSELVES, AND A PROJECT FOR GOING THITHER
WAS THE CONSEQUENCE.

THE YOUNG PEOPLE WERE ALL WILD TO SEE LYME.  CAPTAIN WENTWORTH TALKED
OF GOING THERE AGAIN HIMSELF, IT WAS ONLY SEVENTEEN MILES FROM
UPPERCROSS; THOUGH NOVEMBER, THE WEATHER WAS BY NO MEANS BAD; AND, IN
SHORT, LOUISA, WHO WAS THE MOST EAGER OF THE EAGER, HAVING FORMED THE
RESOLUTION TO GO, AND BESIDES THE PLEASURE OF DOING AS SHE LIKED, BEING
NOW ARMED WITH THE IDEA OF MERIT IN MAINTAINING HER OWN WAY, BORE DOWN
ALL THE WISHES OF HER FATHER AND MOTHER FOR PUTTING IT OFF TILL SUMMER;
AND TO LYME THEY WERE TO GO--CHARLES, MARY, ANNE, HENRIETTA, LOUISA,
AND CAPTAIN WENTWORTH.

THE FIRST HEEDLESS SCHEME HAD BEEN TO GO IN THE MORNING AND RETURN AT
NIGHT; BUT TO THIS MR MUSGROVE, FOR THE SAKE OF HIS HORSES, WOULD NOT
CONSENT; AND WHEN IT CAME TO BE RATIONALLY CONSIDERED, A DAY IN THE
MIDDLE OF NOVEMBER WOULD NOT LEAVE MUCH TIME FOR SEEING A NEW PLACE,
AFTER DEDUCTING SEVEN HOURS, AS THE NATURE OF THE COUNTRY REQUIRED, FOR
GOING AND RETURNING.  THEY WERE, CONSEQUENTLY, TO STAY THE NIGHT THERE,
AND NOT TO BE EXPECTED BACK TILL THE NEXT DAY'S DINNER.  THIS WAS FELT
TO BE A CONSIDERABLE AMENDMENT; AND THOUGH THEY ALL MET AT THE GREAT
HOUSE AT RATHER AN EARLY BREAKFAST HOUR, AND SET OFF VERY PUNCTUALLY,
IT WAS SO MUCH PAST NOON BEFORE THE TWO CARRIAGES, MR MUSGROVE'S COACH
CONTAINING THE FOUR LADIES, AND CHARLES'S CURRICLE, IN WHICH HE DROVE
CAPTAIN WENTWORTH, WERE DESCENDING THE LONG HILL INTO LYME, AND
ENTERING UPON THE STILL STEEPER STREET OF THE TOWN ITSELF, THAT IT WAS
VERY EVIDENT THEY WOULD NOT HAVE MORE THAN TIME FOR LOOKING ABOUT THEM,
BEFORE THE LIGHT AND WARMTH OF THE DAY WERE GONE.

AFTER SECURING ACCOMMODATIONS, AND ORDERING A DINNER AT ONE OF THE
INNS, THE NEXT THING TO BE DONE WAS UNQUESTIONABLY TO WALK DIRECTLY
DOWN TO THE SEA.  THEY WERE COME TOO LATE IN THE YEAR FOR ANY AMUSEMENT
OR VARIETY WHICH LYME, AS A PUBLIC PLACE, MIGHT OFFER.  THE ROOMS WERE
SHUT UP, THE LODGERS ALMOST ALL GONE, SCARCELY ANY FAMILY BUT OF THE
RESIDENTS LEFT; AND, AS THERE IS NOTHING TO ADMIRE IN THE BUILDINGS
THEMSELVES, THE REMARKABLE SITUATION OF THE TOWN, THE PRINCIPAL STREET
ALMOST HURRYING INTO THE WATER, THE WALK TO THE COBB, SKIRTING ROUND
THE PLEASANT LITTLE BAY, WHICH, IN THE SEASON, IS ANIMATED WITH BATHING
MACHINES AND COMPANY; THE COBB ITSELF, ITS OLD WONDERS AND NEW
IMPROVEMENTS, WITH THE VERY BEAUTIFUL LINE OF CLIFFS STRETCHING OUT TO
THE EAST OF THE TOWN, ARE WHAT THE STRANGER'S EYE WILL SEEK; AND A VERY
STRANGE STRANGER IT MUST BE, WHO DOES NOT SEE CHARMS IN THE IMMEDIATE
ENVIRONS OF LYME, TO MAKE HIM WISH TO KNOW IT BETTER.  THE SCENES IN
ITS NEIGHBOURHOOD, CHARMOUTH, WITH ITS HIGH GROUNDS AND EXTENSIVE
SWEEPS OF COUNTRY, AND STILL MORE, ITS SWEET, RETIRED BAY, BACKED BY
DARK CLIFFS, WHERE FRAGMENTS OF LOW ROCK AMONG THE SANDS, MAKE IT THE
HAPPIEST SPOT FOR WATCHING THE FLOW OF THE TIDE, FOR SITTING IN
UNWEARIED CONTEMPLATION; THE WOODY VARIETIES OF THE CHEERFUL VILLAGE OF
UP LYME; AND, ABOVE ALL, PINNY, WITH ITS GREEN CHASMS BETWEEN ROMANTIC
ROCKS, WHERE THE SCATTERED FOREST TREES AND ORCHARDS OF LUXURIANT
GROWTH, DECLARE THAT MANY A GENERATION MUST HAVE PASSED AWAY SINCE THE
FIRST PARTIAL FALLING OF THE CLIFF PREPARED THE GROUND FOR SUCH A
STATE, WHERE A SCENE SO WONDERFUL AND SO LOVELY IS EXHIBITED, AS MAY
MORE THAN EQUAL ANY OF THE RESEMBLING SCENES OF THE FAR-FAMED ISLE OF
WIGHT:  THESE PLACES MUST BE VISITED, AND VISITED AGAIN, TO MAKE THE
WORTH OF LYME UNDERSTOOD.

THE PARTY FROM UPPERCROSS PASSING DOWN BY THE NOW DESERTED AND
MELANCHOLY LOOKING ROOMS, AND STILL DESCENDING, SOON FOUND THEMSELVES
ON THE SEA-SHORE; AND LINGERING ONLY, AS ALL MUST LINGER AND GAZE ON A
FIRST RETURN TO THE SEA, WHO EVER DESERVED TO LOOK ON IT AT ALL,
PROCEEDED TOWARDS THE COBB, EQUALLY THEIR OBJECT IN ITSELF AND ON
CAPTAIN WENTWORTH'S ACCOUNT:  FOR IN A SMALL HOUSE, NEAR THE FOOT OF AN
OLD PIER OF UNKNOWN DATE, WERE THE HARVILLES SETTLED.  CAPTAIN
WENTWORTH TURNED IN TO CALL ON HIS FRIEND; THE OTHERS WALKED ON, AND HE
WAS TO JOIN THEM ON THE COBB.

THEY WERE BY NO MEANS TIRED OF WONDERING AND ADMIRING; AND NOT EVEN
LOUISA SEEMED TO FEEL THAT THEY HAD PARTED WITH CAPTAIN WENTWORTH LONG,
WHEN THEY SAW HIM COMING AFTER THEM, WITH THREE COMPANIONS, ALL WELL
KNOWN ALREADY, BY DESCRIPTION, TO BE CAPTAIN AND MRS HARVILLE, AND A
CAPTAIN BENWICK, WHO WAS STAYING WITH THEM.

CAPTAIN BENWICK HAD SOME TIME AGO BEEN FIRST LIEUTENANT OF THE LACONIA;
AND THE ACCOUNT WHICH CAPTAIN WENTWORTH HAD GIVEN OF HIM, ON HIS RETURN
FROM LYME BEFORE, HIS WARM PRAISE OF HIM AS AN EXCELLENT YOUNG MAN AND
AN OFFICER, WHOM HE HAD ALWAYS VALUED HIGHLY, WHICH MUST HAVE STAMPED
HIM WELL IN THE ESTEEM OF EVERY LISTENER, HAD BEEN FOLLOWED BY A LITTLE
HISTORY OF HIS PRIVATE LIFE, WHICH RENDERED HIM PERFECTLY INTERESTING
IN THE EYES OF ALL THE LADIES.  HE HAD BEEN ENGAGED TO CAPTAIN
HARVILLE'S SISTER, AND WAS NOW MOURNING HER LOSS.  THEY HAD BEEN A YEAR
OR TWO WAITING FOR FORTUNE AND PROMOTION.  FORTUNE CAME, HIS
PRIZE-MONEY AS LIEUTENANT BEING GREAT; PROMOTION, TOO, CAME AT LAST;
BUT FANNY HARVILLE DID NOT LIVE TO KNOW IT.  SHE HAD DIED THE PRECEDING
SUMMER WHILE HE WAS AT SEA.  CAPTAIN WENTWORTH BELIEVED IT IMPOSSIBLE
FOR MAN TO BE MORE ATTACHED TO WOMAN THAN POOR BENWICK HAD BEEN TO
FANNY HARVILLE, OR TO BE MORE DEEPLY AFFLICTED UNDER THE DREADFUL
CHANGE.  HE CONSIDERED HIS DISPOSITION AS OF THE SORT WHICH MUST SUFFER
HEAVILY, UNITING VERY STRONG FEELINGS WITH QUIET, SERIOUS, AND RETIRING
MANNERS, AND A DECIDED TASTE FOR READING, AND SEDENTARY PURSUITS.  TO
FINISH THE INTEREST OF THE STORY, THE FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN HIM AND THE
HARVILLES SEEMED, IF POSSIBLE, AUGMENTED BY THE EVENT WHICH CLOSED ALL
THEIR VIEWS OF ALLIANCE, AND CAPTAIN BENWICK WAS NOW LIVING WITH THEM
ENTIRELY.  CAPTAIN HARVILLE HAD TAKEN HIS PRESENT HOUSE FOR HALF A
YEAR; HIS TASTE, AND HIS HEALTH, AND HIS FORTUNE, ALL DIRECTING HIM TO
A RESIDENCE INEXPENSIVE, AND BY THE SEA; AND THE GRANDEUR OF THE
COUNTRY, AND THE RETIREMENT OF LYME IN THE WINTER, APPEARED EXACTLY
ADAPTED TO CAPTAIN BENWICK'S STATE OF MIND.  THE SYMPATHY AND GOOD-WILL
EXCITED TOWARDS CAPTAIN BENWICK WAS VERY GREAT.

"AND YET," SAID ANNE TO HERSELF, AS THEY NOW MOVED FORWARD TO MEET THE
PARTY, "HE HAS NOT, PERHAPS, A MORE SORROWING HEART THAN I HAVE.  I
CANNOT BELIEVE HIS PROSPECTS SO BLIGHTED FOR EVER.  HE IS YOUNGER THAN
I AM; YOUNGER IN FEELING, IF NOT IN FACT; YOUNGER AS A MAN.  HE WILL
RALLY AGAIN, AND BE HAPPY WITH ANOTHER."

THEY ALL MET, AND WERE INTRODUCED.  CAPTAIN HARVILLE WAS A TALL, DARK
MAN, WITH A SENSIBLE, BENEVOLENT COUNTENANCE; A LITTLE LAME; AND FROM
STRONG FEATURES AND WANT OF HEALTH, LOOKING MUCH OLDER THAN CAPTAIN
WENTWORTH.  CAPTAIN BENWICK LOOKED, AND WAS, THE YOUNGEST OF THE THREE,
AND, COMPARED WITH EITHER OF THEM, A LITTLE MAN.  HE HAD A PLEASING
FACE AND A MELANCHOLY AIR, JUST AS HE OUGHT TO HAVE, AND DREW BACK FROM
CONVERSATION.

CAPTAIN HARVILLE, THOUGH NOT EQUALLING CAPTAIN WENTWORTH IN MANNERS,
WAS A PERFECT GENTLEMAN, UNAFFECTED, WARM, AND OBLIGING.  MRS HARVILLE,
A DEGREE LESS POLISHED THAN HER HUSBAND, SEEMED, HOWEVER, TO HAVE THE
SAME GOOD FEELINGS; AND NOTHING COULD BE MORE PLEASANT THAN THEIR
DESIRE OF CONSIDERING THE WHOLE PARTY AS FRIENDS OF THEIR OWN, BECAUSE
THE FRIENDS OF CAPTAIN WENTWORTH, OR MORE KINDLY HOSPITABLE THAN THEIR
ENTREATIES FOR THEIR ALL PROMISING TO DINE WITH THEM.  THE DINNER,
ALREADY ORDERED AT THE INN, WAS AT LAST, THOUGH UNWILLINGLY, ACCEPTED
AS A EXCUSE; BUT THEY SEEMED ALMOST HURT THAT CAPTAIN WENTWORTH SHOULD
HAVE BROUGHT ANY SUCH PARTY TO LYME, WITHOUT CONSIDERING IT AS A THING
OF COURSE THAT THEY SHOULD DINE WITH THEM.

THERE WAS SO MUCH ATTACHMENT TO CAPTAIN WENTWORTH IN ALL THIS, AND SUCH
A BEWITCHING CHARM IN A DEGREE OF HOSPITALITY SO UNCOMMON, SO UNLIKE
THE USUAL STYLE OF GIVE-AND-TAKE INVITATIONS, AND DINNERS OF FORMALITY
AND DISPLAY, THAT ANNE FELT HER SPIRITS NOT LIKELY TO BE BENEFITED BY
AN INCREASING ACQUAINTANCE AMONG HIS BROTHER-OFFICERS.  "THESE WOULD
HAVE BEEN ALL MY FRIENDS," WAS HER THOUGHT; AND SHE HAD TO STRUGGLE
AGAINST A GREAT TENDENCY TO LOWNESS.

ON QUITTING THE COBB, THEY ALL WENT IN-DOORS WITH THEIR NEW FRIENDS,
AND FOUND ROOMS SO SMALL AS NONE BUT THOSE WHO INVITE FROM THE HEART
COULD THINK CAPABLE OF ACCOMMODATING SO MANY.  ANNE HAD A MOMENT'S
ASTONISHMENT ON THE SUBJECT HERSELF; BUT IT WAS SOON LOST IN THE
PLEASANTER FEELINGS WHICH SPRANG FROM THE SIGHT OF ALL THE INGENIOUS
CONTRIVANCES AND NICE ARRANGEMENTS OF CAPTAIN HARVILLE, TO TURN THE
ACTUAL SPACE TO THE BEST ACCOUNT, TO SUPPLY THE DEFICIENCIES OF
LODGING-HOUSE FURNITURE, AND DEFEND THE WINDOWS AND DOORS AGAINST THE
WINTER STORMS TO BE EXPECTED.  THE VARIETIES IN THE FITTING-UP OF THE
ROOMS, WHERE THE COMMON NECESSARIES PROVIDED BY THE OWNER, IN THE
COMMON INDIFFERENT PLIGHT, WERE CONTRASTED WITH SOME FEW ARTICLES OF A
RARE SPECIES OF WOOD, EXCELLENTLY WORKED UP, AND WITH SOMETHING CURIOUS
AND VALUABLE FROM ALL THE DISTANT COUNTRIES CAPTAIN HARVILLE HAD
VISITED, WERE MORE THAN AMUSING TO ANNE; CONNECTED AS IT ALL WAS WITH
HIS PROFESSION, THE FRUIT OF ITS LABOURS, THE EFFECT OF ITS INFLUENCE
ON HIS HABITS, THE PICTURE OF REPOSE AND DOMESTIC HAPPINESS IT
PRESENTED, MADE IT TO HER A SOMETHING MORE, OR LESS, THAN GRATIFICATION.

CAPTAIN HARVILLE WAS NO READER; BUT HE HAD CONTRIVED EXCELLENT
ACCOMMODATIONS, AND FASHIONED VERY PRETTY SHELVES, FOR A TOLERABLE
COLLECTION OF WELL-BOUND VOLUMES, THE PROPERTY OF CAPTAIN BENWICK.  HIS
LAMENESS PREVENTED HIM FROM TAKING MUCH EXERCISE; BUT A MIND OF
USEFULNESS AND INGENUITY SEEMED TO FURNISH HIM WITH CONSTANT EMPLOYMENT
WITHIN.  HE DREW, HE VARNISHED, HE CARPENTERED, HE GLUED; HE MADE TOYS
FOR THE CHILDREN; HE FASHIONED NEW NETTING-NEEDLES AND PINS WITH
IMPROVEMENTS; AND IF EVERYTHING ELSE WAS DONE, SAT DOWN TO HIS LARGE
FISHING-NET AT ONE CORNER OF THE ROOM.

ANNE THOUGHT SHE LEFT GREAT HAPPINESS BEHIND HER WHEN THEY QUITTED THE
HOUSE; AND LOUISA, BY WHOM SHE FOUND HERSELF WALKING, BURST FORTH INTO
RAPTURES OF ADMIRATION AND DELIGHT ON THE CHARACTER OF THE NAVY; THEIR
FRIENDLINESS, THEIR BROTHERLINESS, THEIR OPENNESS, THEIR UPRIGHTNESS;
PROTESTING THAT SHE WAS CONVINCED OF SAILORS HAVING MORE WORTH AND
WARMTH THAN ANY OTHER SET OF MEN IN ENGLAND; THAT THEY ONLY KNEW HOW TO
LIVE, AND THEY ONLY DESERVED TO BE RESPECTED AND LOVED.

THEY WENT BACK TO DRESS AND DINE; AND SO WELL HAD THE SCHEME ANSWERED
ALREADY, THAT NOTHING WAS FOUND AMISS; THOUGH ITS BEING "SO ENTIRELY
OUT OF SEASON," AND THE "NO THOROUGHFARE OF LYME," AND THE "NO
EXPECTATION OF COMPANY," HAD BROUGHT MANY APOLOGIES FROM THE HEADS OF
THE INN.

ANNE FOUND HERSELF BY THIS TIME GROWING SO MUCH MORE HARDENED TO BEING
IN CAPTAIN WENTWORTH'S COMPANY THAN SHE HAD AT FIRST IMAGINED COULD
EVER BE, THAT THE SITTING DOWN TO THE SAME TABLE WITH HIM NOW, AND THE
INTERCHANGE OF THE COMMON CIVILITIES ATTENDING ON IT (THEY NEVER GOT
BEYOND), WAS BECOME A MERE NOTHING.

THE NIGHTS WERE TOO DARK FOR THE LADIES TO MEET AGAIN TILL THE MORROW,
BUT CAPTAIN HARVILLE HAD PROMISED THEM A VISIT IN THE EVENING; AND HE
CAME, BRINGING HIS FRIEND ALSO, WHICH WAS MORE THAN HAD BEEN EXPECTED,
IT HAVING BEEN AGREED THAT CAPTAIN BENWICK HAD ALL THE APPEARANCE OF
BEING OPPRESSED BY THE PRESENCE OF SO MANY STRANGERS.  HE VENTURED
AMONG THEM AGAIN, HOWEVER, THOUGH HIS SPIRITS CERTAINLY DID NOT SEEM
FIT FOR THE MIRTH OF THE PARTY IN GENERAL.

WHILE CAPTAINS WENTWORTH AND HARVILLE LED THE TALK ON ONE SIDE OF THE
ROOM, AND BY RECURRING TO FORMER DAYS, SUPPLIED ANECDOTES IN ABUNDANCE
TO OCCUPY AND ENTERTAIN THE OTHERS, IT FELL TO ANNE'S LOT TO BE PLACED
RATHER APART WITH CAPTAIN BENWICK; AND A VERY GOOD IMPULSE OF HER
NATURE OBLIGED HER TO BEGIN AN ACQUAINTANCE WITH HIM.  HE WAS SHY, AND
DISPOSED TO ABSTRACTION; BUT THE ENGAGING MILDNESS OF HER COUNTENANCE,
AND GENTLENESS OF HER MANNERS, SOON HAD THEIR EFFECT; AND ANNE WAS WELL
REPAID THE FIRST TROUBLE OF EXERTION.  HE WAS EVIDENTLY A YOUNG MAN OF
CONSIDERABLE TASTE IN READING, THOUGH PRINCIPALLY IN POETRY; AND
BESIDES THE PERSUASION OF HAVING GIVEN HIM AT LEAST AN EVENING'S
INDULGENCE IN THE DISCUSSION OF SUBJECTS, WHICH HIS USUAL COMPANIONS
HAD PROBABLY NO CONCERN IN, SHE HAD THE HOPE OF BEING OF REAL USE TO
HIM IN SOME SUGGESTIONS AS TO THE DUTY AND BENEFIT OF STRUGGLING
AGAINST AFFLICTION, WHICH HAD NATURALLY GROWN OUT OF THEIR
CONVERSATION.  FOR, THOUGH SHY, HE DID NOT SEEM RESERVED; IT HAD RATHER
THE APPEARANCE OF FEELINGS GLAD TO BURST THEIR USUAL RESTRAINTS; AND
HAVING TALKED OF POETRY, THE RICHNESS OF THE PRESENT AGE, AND GONE
THROUGH A BRIEF COMPARISON OF OPINION AS TO THE FIRST-RATE POETS,
TRYING TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER MARMION OR THE LADY OF THE LAKE WERE TO BE
PREFERRED, AND HOW RANKED THE GIAOUR AND THE BRIDE OF ABYDOS; AND
MOREOVER, HOW THE GIAOUR WAS TO BE PRONOUNCED, HE SHOWED HIMSELF SO
INTIMATELY ACQUAINTED WITH ALL THE TENDEREST SONGS OF THE ONE POET, AND
ALL THE IMPASSIONED DESCRIPTIONS OF HOPELESS AGONY OF THE OTHER; HE
REPEATED, WITH SUCH TREMULOUS FEELING, THE VARIOUS LINES WHICH IMAGED A
BROKEN HEART, OR A MIND DESTROYED BY WRETCHEDNESS, AND LOOKED SO
ENTIRELY AS IF HE MEANT TO BE UNDERSTOOD, THAT SHE VENTURED TO HOPE HE
DID NOT ALWAYS READ ONLY POETRY, AND TO SAY, THAT SHE THOUGHT IT WAS
THE MISFORTUNE OF POETRY TO BE SELDOM SAFELY ENJOYED BY THOSE WHO
ENJOYED IT COMPLETELY; AND THAT THE STRONG FEELINGS WHICH ALONE COULD
ESTIMATE IT TRULY WERE THE VERY FEELINGS WHICH OUGHT TO TASTE IT BUT
SPARINGLY.

HIS LOOKS SHEWING HIM NOT PAINED, BUT PLEASED WITH THIS ALLUSION TO HIS
SITUATION, SHE WAS EMBOLDENED TO GO ON; AND FEELING IN HERSELF THE
RIGHT OF SENIORITY OF MIND, SHE VENTURED TO RECOMMEND A LARGER
ALLOWANCE OF PROSE IN HIS DAILY STUDY; AND ON BEING REQUESTED TO
PARTICULARIZE, MENTIONED SUCH WORKS OF OUR BEST MORALISTS, SUCH
COLLECTIONS OF THE FINEST LETTERS, SUCH MEMOIRS OF CHARACTERS OF WORTH
AND SUFFERING, AS OCCURRED TO HER AT THE MOMENT AS CALCULATED TO ROUSE
AND FORTIFY THE MIND BY THE HIGHEST PRECEPTS, AND THE STRONGEST
EXAMPLES OF MORAL AND RELIGIOUS ENDURANCES.

CAPTAIN BENWICK LISTENED ATTENTIVELY, AND SEEMED GRATEFUL FOR THE
INTEREST IMPLIED; AND THOUGH WITH A SHAKE OF THE HEAD, AND SIGHS WHICH
DECLARED HIS LITTLE FAITH IN THE EFFICACY OF ANY BOOKS ON GRIEF LIKE
HIS, NOTED DOWN THE NAMES OF THOSE SHE RECOMMENDED, AND PROMISED TO
PROCURE AND READ THEM.

WHEN THE EVENING WAS OVER, ANNE COULD NOT BUT BE AMUSED AT THE IDEA OF
HER COMING TO LYME TO PREACH PATIENCE AND RESIGNATION TO A YOUNG MAN
WHOM SHE HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE; NOR COULD SHE HELP FEARING, ON MORE
SERIOUS REFLECTION, THAT, LIKE MANY OTHER GREAT MORALISTS AND
PREACHERS, SHE HAD BEEN ELOQUENT ON A POINT IN WHICH HER OWN CONDUCT
WOULD ILL BEAR EXAMINATION.



CHAPTER 12


ANNE AND HENRIETTA, FINDING THEMSELVES THE EARLIEST OF THE PARTY THE
NEXT MORNING, AGREED TO STROLL DOWN TO THE SEA BEFORE BREAKFAST.  THEY
WENT TO THE SANDS, TO WATCH THE FLOWING OF THE TIDE, WHICH A FINE
SOUTH-EASTERLY BREEZE WAS BRINGING IN WITH ALL THE GRANDEUR WHICH SO
FLAT A SHORE ADMITTED.  THEY PRAISED THE MORNING; GLORIED IN THE SEA;
SYMPATHIZED IN THE DELIGHT OF THE FRESH-FEELING BREEZE--AND WERE
SILENT; TILL HENRIETTA SUDDENLY BEGAN AGAIN WITH--

"OH! YES,--I AM QUITE CONVINCED THAT, WITH VERY FEW EXCEPTIONS, THE
SEA-AIR ALWAYS DOES GOOD.  THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT OF ITS HAVING BEEN OF
THE GREATEST SERVICE TO DR SHIRLEY, AFTER HIS ILLNESS, LAST SPRING
TWELVE-MONTH.  HE DECLARES HIMSELF, THAT COMING TO LYME FOR A MONTH,
DID HIM MORE GOOD THAN ALL THE MEDICINE HE TOOK; AND, THAT BEING BY THE
SEA, ALWAYS MAKES HIM FEEL YOUNG AGAIN.  NOW, I CANNOT HELP THINKING IT
A PITY THAT HE DOES NOT LIVE ENTIRELY BY THE SEA.  I DO THINK HE HAD
BETTER LEAVE UPPERCROSS ENTIRELY, AND FIX AT LYME.  DO NOT YOU, ANNE?
DO NOT YOU AGREE WITH ME, THAT IT IS THE BEST THING HE COULD DO, BOTH
FOR HIMSELF AND MRS SHIRLEY?  SHE HAS COUSINS HERE, YOU KNOW, AND MANY
ACQUAINTANCE, WHICH WOULD MAKE IT CHEERFUL FOR HER, AND I AM SURE SHE
WOULD BE GLAD TO GET TO A PLACE WHERE SHE COULD HAVE MEDICAL ATTENDANCE
AT HAND, IN CASE OF HIS HAVING ANOTHER SEIZURE.  INDEED I THINK IT
QUITE MELANCHOLY TO HAVE SUCH EXCELLENT PEOPLE AS DR AND MRS SHIRLEY,
WHO HAVE BEEN DOING GOOD ALL THEIR LIVES, WEARING OUT THEIR LAST DAYS
IN A PLACE LIKE UPPERCROSS, WHERE, EXCEPTING OUR FAMILY, THEY SEEM SHUT
OUT FROM ALL THE WORLD.  I WISH HIS FRIENDS WOULD PROPOSE IT TO HIM.  I
REALLY THINK THEY OUGHT.  AND, AS TO PROCURING A DISPENSATION, THERE
COULD BE NO DIFFICULTY AT HIS TIME OF LIFE, AND WITH HIS CHARACTER.  MY
ONLY DOUBT IS, WHETHER ANYTHING COULD PERSUADE HIM TO LEAVE HIS PARISH.
HE IS SO VERY STRICT AND SCRUPULOUS IN HIS NOTIONS; OVER-SCRUPULOUS I
MUST SAY.  DO NOT YOU THINK, ANNE, IT IS BEING OVER-SCRUPULOUS?  DO NOT
YOU THINK IT IS QUITE A MISTAKEN POINT OF CONSCIENCE, WHEN A CLERGYMAN
SACRIFICES HIS HEALTH FOR THE SAKE OF DUTIES, WHICH MAY BE JUST AS WELL
PERFORMED BY ANOTHER PERSON?  AND AT LYME TOO, ONLY SEVENTEEN MILES
OFF, HE WOULD BE NEAR ENOUGH TO HEAR, IF PEOPLE THOUGHT THERE WAS
ANYTHING TO COMPLAIN OF."

ANNE SMILED MORE THAN ONCE TO HERSELF DURING THIS SPEECH, AND ENTERED
INTO THE SUBJECT, AS READY TO DO GOOD BY ENTERING INTO THE FEELINGS OF
A YOUNG LADY AS OF A YOUNG MAN, THOUGH HERE IT WAS GOOD OF A LOWER
STANDARD, FOR WHAT COULD BE OFFERED BUT GENERAL ACQUIESCENCE?  SHE SAID
ALL THAT WAS REASONABLE AND PROPER ON THE BUSINESS; FELT THE CLAIMS OF
DR SHIRLEY TO REPOSE AS SHE OUGHT; SAW HOW VERY DESIRABLE IT WAS THAT
HE SHOULD HAVE SOME ACTIVE, RESPECTABLE YOUNG MAN, AS A RESIDENT
CURATE, AND WAS EVEN COURTEOUS ENOUGH TO HINT AT THE ADVANTAGE OF SUCH
RESIDENT CURATE'S BEING MARRIED.

"I WISH," SAID HENRIETTA, VERY WELL PLEASED WITH HER COMPANION, "I WISH
LADY RUSSELL LIVED AT UPPERCROSS, AND WERE INTIMATE WITH DR SHIRLEY.  I
HAVE ALWAYS HEARD OF LADY RUSSELL AS A WOMAN OF THE GREATEST INFLUENCE
WITH EVERYBODY!  I ALWAYS LOOK UPON HER AS ABLE TO PERSUADE A PERSON TO
ANYTHING!  I AM AFRAID OF HER, AS I HAVE TOLD YOU BEFORE, QUITE AFRAID
OF HER, BECAUSE SHE IS SO VERY CLEVER; BUT I RESPECT HER AMAZINGLY, AND
WISH WE HAD SUCH A NEIGHBOUR AT UPPERCROSS."

ANNE WAS AMUSED BY HENRIETTA'S MANNER OF BEING GRATEFUL, AND AMUSED
ALSO THAT THE COURSE OF EVENTS AND THE NEW INTERESTS OF HENRIETTA'S
VIEWS SHOULD HAVE PLACED HER FRIEND AT ALL IN FAVOUR WITH ANY OF THE
MUSGROVE FAMILY; SHE HAD ONLY TIME, HOWEVER, FOR A GENERAL ANSWER, AND
A WISH THAT SUCH ANOTHER WOMAN WERE AT UPPERCROSS, BEFORE ALL SUBJECTS
SUDDENLY CEASED, ON SEEING LOUISA AND CAPTAIN WENTWORTH COMING TOWARDS
THEM.  THEY CAME ALSO FOR A STROLL TILL BREAKFAST WAS LIKELY TO BE
READY; BUT LOUISA RECOLLECTING, IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS THAT SHE HAD
SOMETHING TO PROCURE AT A SHOP, INVITED THEM ALL TO GO BACK WITH HER
INTO THE TOWN.  THEY WERE ALL AT HER DISPOSAL.

WHEN THEY CAME TO THE STEPS, LEADING UPWARDS FROM THE BEACH, A
GENTLEMAN, AT THE SAME MOMENT PREPARING TO COME DOWN, POLITELY DREW
BACK, AND STOPPED TO GIVE THEM WAY.  THEY ASCENDED AND PASSED HIM; AND
AS THEY PASSED, ANNE'S FACE CAUGHT HIS EYE, AND HE LOOKED AT HER WITH A
DEGREE OF EARNEST ADMIRATION, WHICH SHE COULD NOT BE INSENSIBLE OF.
SHE WAS LOOKING REMARKABLY WELL; HER VERY REGULAR, VERY PRETTY
FEATURES, HAVING THE BLOOM AND FRESHNESS OF YOUTH RESTORED BY THE FINE
WIND WHICH HAD BEEN BLOWING ON HER COMPLEXION, AND BY THE ANIMATION OF
EYE WHICH IT HAD ALSO PRODUCED.  IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE GENTLEMAN,
(COMPLETELY A GENTLEMAN IN MANNER) ADMIRED HER EXCEEDINGLY.  CAPTAIN
WENTWORTH LOOKED ROUND AT HER INSTANTLY IN A WAY WHICH SHEWED HIS
NOTICING OF IT.  HE GAVE HER A MOMENTARY GLANCE, A GLANCE OF
BRIGHTNESS, WHICH SEEMED TO SAY, "THAT MAN IS STRUCK WITH YOU, AND EVEN
I, AT THIS MOMENT, SEE SOMETHING LIKE ANNE ELLIOT AGAIN."

AFTER ATTENDING LOUISA THROUGH HER BUSINESS, AND LOITERING ABOUT A
LITTLE LONGER, THEY RETURNED TO THE INN; AND ANNE, IN PASSING
AFTERWARDS QUICKLY FROM HER OWN CHAMBER TO THEIR DINING-ROOM, HAD
NEARLY RUN AGAINST THE VERY SAME GENTLEMAN, AS HE CAME OUT OF AN
ADJOINING APARTMENT.  SHE HAD BEFORE CONJECTURED HIM TO BE A STRANGER
LIKE THEMSELVES, AND DETERMINED THAT A WELL-LOOKING GROOM, WHO WAS
STROLLING ABOUT NEAR THE TWO INNS AS THEY CAME BACK, SHOULD BE HIS
SERVANT.  BOTH MASTER AND MAN BEING IN MOURNING ASSISTED THE IDEA.  IT
WAS NOW PROVED THAT HE BELONGED TO THE SAME INN AS THEMSELVES; AND THIS
SECOND MEETING, SHORT AS IT WAS, ALSO PROVED AGAIN BY THE GENTLEMAN'S
LOOKS, THAT HE THOUGHT HERS VERY LOVELY, AND BY THE READINESS AND
PROPRIETY OF HIS APOLOGIES, THAT HE WAS A MAN OF EXCEEDINGLY GOOD
MANNERS.  HE SEEMED ABOUT THIRTY, AND THOUGH NOT HANDSOME, HAD AN
AGREEABLE PERSON.  ANNE FELT THAT SHE SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHO HE WAS.

THEY HAD NEARLY DONE BREAKFAST, WHEN THE SOUND OF A CARRIAGE, (ALMOST
THE FIRST THEY HAD HEARD SINCE ENTERING LYME) DREW HALF THE PARTY TO
THE WINDOW.  IT WAS A GENTLEMAN'S CARRIAGE, A CURRICLE, BUT ONLY COMING
ROUND FROM THE STABLE-YARD TO THE FRONT DOOR; SOMEBODY MUST BE GOING
AWAY.  IT WAS DRIVEN BY A SERVANT IN MOURNING.

THE WORD CURRICLE MADE CHARLES MUSGROVE JUMP UP THAT HE MIGHT COMPARE
IT WITH HIS OWN; THE SERVANT IN MOURNING ROUSED ANNE'S CURIOSITY, AND
THE WHOLE SIX WERE COLLECTED TO LOOK, BY THE TIME THE OWNER OF THE
CURRICLE WAS TO BE SEEN ISSUING FROM THE DOOR AMIDST THE BOWS AND
CIVILITIES OF THE HOUSEHOLD, AND TAKING HIS SEAT, TO DRIVE OFF.

"AH!" CRIED CAPTAIN WENTWORTH, INSTANTLY, AND WITH HALF A GLANCE AT
ANNE, "IT IS THE VERY MAN WE PASSED."

THE MISS MUSGROVES AGREED TO IT; AND HAVING ALL KINDLY WATCHED HIM AS
FAR UP THE HILL AS THEY COULD, THEY RETURNED TO THE BREAKFAST TABLE.
THE WAITER CAME INTO THE ROOM SOON AFTERWARDS.

"PRAY," SAID CAPTAIN WENTWORTH, IMMEDIATELY, "CAN YOU TELL US THE NAME
OF THE GENTLEMAN WHO IS JUST GONE AWAY?"

"YES, SIR, A MR ELLIOT, A GENTLEMAN OF LARGE FORTUNE, CAME IN LAST
NIGHT FROM SIDMOUTH.  DARE SAY YOU HEARD THE CARRIAGE, SIR, WHILE YOU
WERE AT DINNER; AND GOING ON NOW FOR CREWKHERNE, IN HIS WAY TO BATH AND
LONDON."

"ELLIOT!"  MANY HAD LOOKED ON EACH OTHER, AND MANY HAD REPEATED THE
NAME, BEFORE ALL THIS HAD BEEN GOT THROUGH, EVEN BY THE SMART RAPIDITY
OF A WAITER.

"BLESS ME!" CRIED MARY; "IT MUST BE OUR COUSIN; IT MUST BE OUR MR
ELLIOT, IT MUST, INDEED!  CHARLES, ANNE, MUST NOT IT?  IN MOURNING, YOU
SEE, JUST AS OUR MR ELLIOT MUST BE.  HOW VERY EXTRAORDINARY!  IN THE
VERY SAME INN WITH US!  ANNE, MUST NOT IT BE OUR MR ELLIOT?  MY
FATHER'S NEXT HEIR?  PRAY SIR," TURNING TO THE WAITER, "DID NOT YOU
HEAR, DID NOT HIS SERVANT SAY WHETHER HE BELONGED TO THE KELLYNCH
FAMILY?"

"NO, MA'AM, HE DID NOT MENTION NO PARTICULAR FAMILY; BUT HE SAID HIS
MASTER WAS A VERY RICH GENTLEMAN, AND WOULD BE A BARONIGHT SOME DAY."

"THERE! YOU SEE!" CRIED MARY IN AN ECSTASY, "JUST AS I SAID!  HEIR TO
SIR WALTER ELLIOT!  I WAS SURE THAT WOULD COME OUT, IF IT WAS SO.
DEPEND UPON IT, THAT IS A CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH HIS SERVANTS TAKE CARE TO
PUBLISH, WHEREVER HE GOES.  BUT, ANNE, ONLY CONCEIVE HOW EXTRAORDINARY!
I WISH I HAD LOOKED AT HIM MORE.  I WISH WE HAD BEEN AWARE IN TIME, WHO
IT WAS, THAT HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED TO US.  WHAT A PITY THAT WE
SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED TO EACH OTHER!  DO YOU THINK HE HAD THE
ELLIOT COUNTENANCE?  I HARDLY LOOKED AT HIM, I WAS LOOKING AT THE
HORSES; BUT I THINK HE HAD SOMETHING OF THE ELLIOT COUNTENANCE, I
WONDER THE ARMS DID NOT STRIKE ME!  OH! THE GREAT-COAT WAS HANGING OVER
THE PANEL, AND HID THE ARMS, SO IT DID; OTHERWISE, I AM SURE, I SHOULD
HAVE OBSERVED THEM, AND THE LIVERY TOO; IF THE SERVANT HAD NOT BEEN IN
MOURNING, ONE SHOULD HAVE KNOWN HIM BY THE LIVERY."

"PUTTING ALL THESE VERY EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES TOGETHER," SAID
CAPTAIN WENTWORTH, "WE MUST CONSIDER IT TO BE THE ARRANGEMENT OF
PROVIDENCE, THAT YOU SHOULD NOT BE INTRODUCED TO YOUR COUSIN."

WHEN SHE COULD COMMAND MARY'S ATTENTION, ANNE QUIETLY TRIED TO CONVINCE
HER THAT THEIR FATHER AND MR ELLIOT HAD NOT, FOR MANY YEARS, BEEN ON
SUCH TERMS AS TO MAKE THE POWER OF ATTEMPTING AN INTRODUCTION AT ALL
DESIRABLE.

AT THE SAME TIME, HOWEVER, IT WAS A SECRET GRATIFICATION TO HERSELF TO
HAVE SEEN HER COUSIN, AND TO KNOW THAT THE FUTURE OWNER OF KELLYNCH WAS
UNDOUBTEDLY A GENTLEMAN, AND HAD AN AIR OF GOOD SENSE.  SHE WOULD NOT,
UPON ANY ACCOUNT, MENTION HER HAVING MET WITH HIM THE SECOND TIME;
LUCKILY MARY DID NOT MUCH ATTEND TO THEIR HAVING PASSED CLOSE BY HIM IN
THEIR EARLIER WALK, BUT SHE WOULD HAVE FELT QUITE ILL-USED BY ANNE'S
HAVING ACTUALLY RUN AGAINST HIM IN THE PASSAGE, AND RECEIVED HIS VERY
POLITE EXCUSES, WHILE SHE HAD NEVER BEEN NEAR HIM AT ALL; NO, THAT
COUSINLY LITTLE INTERVIEW MUST REMAIN A PERFECT SECRET.

"OF COURSE," SAID MARY, "YOU WILL MENTION OUR SEEING MR ELLIOT, THE
NEXT TIME YOU WRITE TO BATH.  I THINK MY FATHER CERTAINLY OUGHT TO HEAR
OF IT; DO MENTION ALL ABOUT HIM."

ANNE AVOIDED A DIRECT REPLY, BUT IT WAS JUST THE CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH SHE
CONSIDERED AS NOT MERELY UNNECESSARY TO BE COMMUNICATED, BUT AS WHAT
OUGHT TO BE SUPPRESSED.  THE OFFENCE WHICH HAD BEEN GIVEN HER FATHER,
MANY YEARS BACK, SHE KNEW; ELIZABETH'S PARTICULAR SHARE IN IT SHE
SUSPECTED; AND THAT MR ELLIOT'S IDEA ALWAYS PRODUCED IRRITATION IN BOTH
WAS BEYOND A DOUBT.  MARY NEVER WROTE TO BATH HERSELF; ALL THE TOIL OF
KEEPING UP A SLOW AND UNSATISFACTORY CORRESPONDENCE WITH ELIZABETH FELL
ON ANNE.

BREAKFAST HAD NOT BEEN LONG OVER, WHEN THEY WERE JOINED BY CAPTAIN AND
MRS HARVILLE AND CAPTAIN BENWICK; WITH WHOM THEY HAD APPOINTED TO TAKE
THEIR LAST WALK ABOUT LYME.  THEY OUGHT TO BE SETTING OFF FOR
UPPERCROSS BY ONE, AND IN THE MEAN WHILE WERE TO BE ALL TOGETHER, AND
OUT OF DOORS AS LONG AS THEY COULD.

ANNE FOUND CAPTAIN BENWICK GETTING NEAR HER, AS SOON AS THEY WERE ALL
FAIRLY IN THE STREET.  THEIR CONVERSATION THE PRECEDING EVENING DID NOT
DISINCLINE HIM TO SEEK HER AGAIN; AND THEY WALKED TOGETHER SOME TIME,
TALKING AS BEFORE OF MR SCOTT AND LORD BYRON, AND STILL AS UNABLE AS
BEFORE, AND AS UNABLE AS ANY OTHER TWO READERS, TO THINK EXACTLY ALIKE
OF THE MERITS OF EITHER, TILL SOMETHING OCCASIONED AN ALMOST GENERAL
CHANGE AMONGST THEIR PARTY, AND INSTEAD OF CAPTAIN BENWICK, SHE HAD
CAPTAIN HARVILLE BY HER SIDE.

"MISS ELLIOT," SAID HE, SPEAKING RATHER LOW, "YOU HAVE DONE A GOOD DEED
IN MAKING THAT POOR FELLOW TALK SO MUCH.  I WISH HE COULD HAVE SUCH
COMPANY OFTENER.  IT IS BAD FOR HIM, I KNOW, TO BE SHUT UP AS HE IS;
BUT WHAT CAN WE DO?  WE CANNOT PART."

"NO," SAID ANNE, "THAT I CAN EASILY BELIEVE TO BE IMPOSSIBLE; BUT IN
TIME, PERHAPS--WE KNOW WHAT TIME DOES IN EVERY CASE OF AFFLICTION, AND
YOU MUST REMEMBER, CAPTAIN HARVILLE, THAT YOUR FRIEND MAY YET BE CALLED
A YOUNG MOURNER--ONLY LAST SUMMER, I UNDERSTAND."

"AY, TRUE ENOUGH," (WITH A DEEP SIGH) "ONLY JUNE."

"AND NOT KNOWN TO HIM, PERHAPS, SO SOON."

"NOT TILL THE FIRST WEEK OF AUGUST, WHEN HE CAME HOME FROM THE CAPE,
JUST MADE INTO THE GRAPPLER.  I WAS AT PLYMOUTH DREADING TO HEAR OF
HIM; HE SENT IN LETTERS, BUT THE GRAPPLER WAS UNDER ORDERS FOR
PORTSMOUTH.  THERE THE NEWS MUST FOLLOW HIM, BUT WHO WAS TO TELL IT?
NOT I.  I WOULD AS SOON HAVE BEEN RUN UP TO THE YARD-ARM.  NOBODY COULD
DO IT, BUT THAT GOOD FELLOW" (POINTING TO CAPTAIN WENTWORTH.)  "THE
LACONIA HAD COME INTO PLYMOUTH THE WEEK BEFORE; NO DANGER OF HER BEING
SENT TO SEA AGAIN.  HE STOOD HIS CHANCE FOR THE REST; WROTE UP FOR
LEAVE OF ABSENCE, BUT WITHOUT WAITING THE RETURN, TRAVELLED NIGHT AND
DAY TILL HE GOT TO PORTSMOUTH, ROWED OFF TO THE GRAPPLER THAT INSTANT,
AND NEVER LEFT THE POOR FELLOW FOR A WEEK.  THAT'S WHAT HE DID, AND
NOBODY ELSE COULD HAVE SAVED POOR JAMES.  YOU MAY THINK, MISS ELLIOT,
WHETHER HE IS DEAR TO US!"

ANNE DID THINK ON THE QUESTION WITH PERFECT DECISION, AND SAID AS MUCH
IN REPLY AS HER OWN FEELING COULD ACCOMPLISH, OR AS HIS SEEMED ABLE TO
BEAR, FOR HE WAS TOO MUCH AFFECTED TO RENEW THE SUBJECT, AND WHEN HE
SPOKE AGAIN, IT WAS OF SOMETHING TOTALLY DIFFERENT.

MRS HARVILLE'S GIVING IT AS HER OPINION THAT HER HUSBAND WOULD HAVE
QUITE WALKING ENOUGH BY THE TIME HE REACHED HOME, DETERMINED THE
DIRECTION OF ALL THE PARTY IN WHAT WAS TO BE THEIR LAST WALK; THEY
WOULD ACCOMPANY THEM TO THEIR DOOR, AND THEN RETURN AND SET OFF
THEMSELVES.  BY ALL THEIR CALCULATIONS THERE WAS JUST TIME FOR THIS;
BUT AS THEY DREW NEAR THE COBB, THERE WAS SUCH A GENERAL WISH TO WALK
ALONG IT ONCE MORE, ALL WERE SO INCLINED, AND LOUISA SOON GREW SO
DETERMINED, THAT THE DIFFERENCE OF A QUARTER OF AN HOUR, IT WAS FOUND,
WOULD BE NO DIFFERENCE AT ALL; SO WITH ALL THE KIND LEAVE-TAKING, AND
ALL THE KIND INTERCHANGE OF INVITATIONS AND PROMISES WHICH MAY BE
IMAGINED, THEY PARTED FROM CAPTAIN AND MRS HARVILLE AT THEIR OWN DOOR,
AND STILL ACCOMPANIED BY CAPTAIN BENWICK, WHO SEEMED TO CLING TO THEM
TO THE LAST, PROCEEDED TO MAKE THE PROPER ADIEUS TO THE COBB.

ANNE FOUND CAPTAIN BENWICK AGAIN DRAWING NEAR HER.  LORD BYRON'S "DARK
BLUE SEAS" COULD NOT FAIL OF BEING BROUGHT FORWARD BY THEIR PRESENT
VIEW, AND SHE GLADLY GAVE HIM ALL HER ATTENTION AS LONG AS ATTENTION
WAS POSSIBLE.  IT WAS SOON DRAWN, PERFORCE ANOTHER WAY.

THERE WAS TOO MUCH WIND TO MAKE THE HIGH PART OF THE NEW COBB PLEASANT
FOR THE LADIES, AND THEY AGREED TO GET DOWN THE STEPS TO THE LOWER, AND
ALL WERE CONTENTED TO PASS QUIETLY AND CAREFULLY DOWN THE STEEP FLIGHT,
EXCEPTING LOUISA; SHE MUST BE JUMPED DOWN THEM BY CAPTAIN WENTWORTH.
IN ALL THEIR WALKS, HE HAD HAD TO JUMP HER FROM THE STILES; THE
SENSATION WAS DELIGHTFUL TO HER.  THE HARDNESS OF THE PAVEMENT FOR HER
FEET, MADE HIM LESS WILLING UPON THE PRESENT OCCASION; HE DID IT,
HOWEVER.  SHE WAS SAFELY DOWN, AND INSTANTLY, TO SHOW HER ENJOYMENT,
RAN UP THE STEPS TO BE JUMPED DOWN AGAIN.  HE ADVISED HER AGAINST IT,
THOUGHT THE JAR TOO GREAT; BUT NO, HE REASONED AND TALKED IN VAIN, SHE
SMILED AND SAID, "I AM DETERMINED I WILL:" HE PUT OUT HIS HANDS; SHE
WAS TOO PRECIPITATE BY HALF A SECOND, SHE FELL ON THE PAVEMENT ON THE
LOWER COBB, AND WAS TAKEN UP LIFELESS!  THERE WAS NO WOUND, NO BLOOD,
NO VISIBLE BRUISE; BUT HER EYES WERE CLOSED, SHE BREATHED NOT, HER FACE
WAS LIKE DEATH.  THE HORROR OF THE MOMENT TO ALL WHO STOOD AROUND!

CAPTAIN WENTWORTH, WHO HAD CAUGHT HER UP, KNELT WITH HER IN HIS ARMS,
LOOKING ON HER WITH A FACE AS PALLID AS HER OWN, IN AN AGONY OF
SILENCE.  "SHE IS DEAD! SHE IS DEAD!" SCREAMED MARY, CATCHING HOLD OF
HER HUSBAND, AND CONTRIBUTING WITH HIS OWN HORROR TO MAKE HIM
IMMOVEABLE; AND IN ANOTHER MOMENT, HENRIETTA, SINKING UNDER THE
CONVICTION, LOST HER SENSES TOO, AND WOULD HAVE FALLEN ON THE STEPS,
BUT FOR CAPTAIN BENWICK AND ANNE, WHO CAUGHT AND SUPPORTED HER BETWEEN
THEM.

"IS THERE NO ONE TO HELP ME?" WERE THE FIRST WORDS WHICH BURST FROM
CAPTAIN WENTWORTH, IN A TONE OF DESPAIR, AND AS IF ALL HIS OWN STRENGTH
WERE GONE.

"GO TO HIM, GO TO HIM," CRIED ANNE, "FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE GO TO HIM.  I
CAN SUPPORT HER MYSELF.  LEAVE ME, AND GO TO HIM.  RUB HER HANDS, RUB
HER TEMPLES; HERE ARE SALTS; TAKE THEM, TAKE THEM."

CAPTAIN BENWICK OBEYED, AND CHARLES AT THE SAME MOMENT, DISENGAGING
HIMSELF FROM HIS WIFE, THEY WERE BOTH WITH HIM; AND LOUISA WAS RAISED
UP AND SUPPORTED MORE FIRMLY BETWEEN THEM, AND EVERYTHING WAS DONE THAT
ANNE HAD PROMPTED, BUT IN VAIN; WHILE CAPTAIN WENTWORTH, STAGGERING
AGAINST THE WALL FOR HIS SUPPORT, EXCLAIMED IN THE BITTEREST AGONY--

"OH GOD! HER FATHER AND MOTHER!"

"A SURGEON!" SAID ANNE.

HE CAUGHT THE WORD; IT SEEMED TO ROUSE HIM AT ONCE, AND SAYING ONLY--
"TRUE, TRUE, A SURGEON THIS INSTANT," WAS DARTING AWAY, WHEN ANNE
EAGERLY SUGGESTED--

"CAPTAIN BENWICK, WOULD NOT IT BE BETTER FOR CAPTAIN BENWICK?  HE KNOWS
WHERE A SURGEON IS TO BE FOUND."

EVERY ONE CAPABLE OF THINKING FELT THE ADVANTAGE OF THE IDEA, AND IN A
MOMENT (IT WAS ALL DONE IN RAPID MOMENTS) CAPTAIN BENWICK HAD RESIGNED
THE POOR CORPSE-LIKE  FIGURE ENTIRELY TO THE BROTHER'S CARE, AND WAS
OFF FOR THE TOWN WITH THE UTMOST RAPIDITY.

AS TO THE WRETCHED PARTY LEFT BEHIND, IT COULD SCARCELY BE SAID WHICH
OF THE THREE, WHO WERE COMPLETELY RATIONAL, WAS SUFFERING MOST: CAPTAIN
WENTWORTH, ANNE, OR CHARLES, WHO, REALLY A VERY AFFECTIONATE BROTHER,
HUNG OVER LOUISA WITH SOBS OF GRIEF, AND COULD ONLY TURN HIS EYES FROM
ONE SISTER, TO SEE THE OTHER IN A STATE AS INSENSIBLE, OR TO WITNESS
THE HYSTERICAL AGITATIONS OF HIS WIFE, CALLING ON HIM FOR HELP WHICH HE
COULD NOT GIVE.

ANNE, ATTENDING WITH ALL THE STRENGTH AND ZEAL, AND THOUGHT, WHICH
INSTINCT SUPPLIED, TO HENRIETTA, STILL TRIED, AT INTERVALS, TO SUGGEST
COMFORT TO THE OTHERS, TRIED TO QUIET MARY, TO ANIMATE CHARLES, TO
ASSUAGE THE FEELINGS OF CAPTAIN WENTWORTH.  BOTH SEEMED TO LOOK TO HER
FOR DIRECTIONS.

"ANNE, ANNE," CRIED CHARLES, "WHAT IS TO BE DONE NEXT?  WHAT, IN
HEAVEN'S NAME, IS TO BE DONE NEXT?"

CAPTAIN WENTWORTH'S EYES WERE ALSO TURNED TOWARDS HER.

"HAD NOT SHE BETTER BE CARRIED TO THE INN?  YES, I AM SURE: CARRY HER
GENTLY TO THE INN."

"YES, YES, TO THE INN," REPEATED CAPTAIN WENTWORTH, COMPARATIVELY
COLLECTED, AND EAGER TO BE DOING SOMETHING.  "I WILL CARRY HER MYSELF.
MUSGROVE, TAKE CARE OF THE OTHERS."

BY THIS TIME THE REPORT OF THE ACCIDENT HAD SPREAD AMONG THE WORKMEN
AND BOATMEN ABOUT THE COBB, AND MANY WERE COLLECTED NEAR THEM, TO BE
USEFUL IF WANTED, AT ANY RATE, TO ENJOY THE SIGHT OF A DEAD YOUNG LADY,
NAY, TWO DEAD YOUNG LADIES, FOR IT PROVED TWICE AS FINE AS THE FIRST
REPORT.  TO SOME OF THE BEST-LOOKING OF THESE GOOD PEOPLE HENRIETTA WAS
CONSIGNED, FOR, THOUGH PARTIALLY REVIVED, SHE WAS QUITE HELPLESS; AND
IN THIS MANNER, ANNE WALKING BY HER SIDE, AND CHARLES ATTENDING TO HIS
WIFE, THEY SET FORWARD, TREADING BACK WITH FEELINGS UNUTTERABLE, THE
GROUND, WHICH SO LATELY, SO VERY LATELY, AND SO LIGHT OF HEART, THEY
HAD PASSED ALONG.

THEY WERE NOT OFF THE COBB, BEFORE THE HARVILLES MET THEM.  CAPTAIN
BENWICK HAD BEEN SEEN FLYING BY THEIR HOUSE, WITH A COUNTENANCE WHICH
SHOWED SOMETHING TO BE WRONG; AND THEY HAD SET OFF IMMEDIATELY,
INFORMED AND DIRECTED AS THEY PASSED, TOWARDS THE SPOT.  SHOCKED AS
CAPTAIN HARVILLE WAS, HE BROUGHT SENSES AND NERVES THAT COULD BE
INSTANTLY USEFUL; AND A LOOK BETWEEN HIM AND HIS WIFE DECIDED WHAT WAS
TO BE DONE.  SHE MUST BE TAKEN TO THEIR HOUSE; ALL MUST GO TO THEIR
HOUSE; AND AWAIT THE SURGEON'S ARRIVAL THERE.  THEY WOULD NOT LISTEN TO
SCRUPLES:  HE WAS OBEYED; THEY WERE ALL BENEATH HIS ROOF; AND WHILE
LOUISA, UNDER MRS HARVILLE'S DIRECTION, WAS CONVEYED UP STAIRS, AND
GIVEN POSSESSION OF HER OWN BED, ASSISTANCE, CORDIALS, RESTORATIVES
WERE SUPPLIED BY HER HUSBAND TO ALL WHO NEEDED THEM.

LOUISA HAD ONCE OPENED HER EYES, BUT SOON CLOSED THEM AGAIN, WITHOUT
APPARENT CONSCIOUSNESS.  THIS HAD BEEN A PROOF OF LIFE, HOWEVER, OF
SERVICE TO HER SISTER; AND HENRIETTA, THOUGH PERFECTLY INCAPABLE OF
BEING IN THE SAME ROOM WITH LOUISA, WAS KEPT, BY THE AGITATION OF HOPE
AND FEAR, FROM A RETURN OF HER OWN INSENSIBILITY.  MARY, TOO, WAS
GROWING CALMER.

THE SURGEON WAS WITH THEM ALMOST BEFORE IT HAD SEEMED POSSIBLE.  THEY
WERE SICK WITH HORROR, WHILE HE EXAMINED; BUT HE WAS NOT HOPELESS.  THE
HEAD HAD RECEIVED A SEVERE CONTUSION, BUT HE HAD SEEN GREATER INJURIES
RECOVERED FROM:  HE WAS BY NO MEANS HOPELESS; HE SPOKE CHEERFULLY.

THAT HE DID NOT REGARD IT AS A DESPERATE CASE, THAT HE DID NOT SAY A
FEW HOURS MUST END IT, WAS AT FIRST FELT, BEYOND THE HOPE OF MOST; AND
THE ECSTASY OF SUCH A REPRIEVE, THE REJOICING, DEEP AND SILENT, AFTER A
FEW FERVENT EJACULATIONS OF GRATITUDE TO HEAVEN HAD BEEN OFFERED, MAY
BE CONCEIVED.

THE TONE, THE LOOK, WITH WHICH "THANK GOD!" WAS UTTERED BY CAPTAIN
WENTWORTH, ANNE WAS SURE COULD NEVER BE FORGOTTEN BY HER; NOR THE SIGHT
OF HIM AFTERWARDS, AS HE SAT NEAR A TABLE, LEANING OVER IT WITH FOLDED
ARMS AND FACE CONCEALED, AS IF OVERPOWERED BY THE VARIOUS FEELINGS OF
HIS SOUL, AND TRYING BY PRAYER AND REFLECTION TO CALM THEM.

LOUISA'S LIMBS HAD ESCAPED.  THERE WAS NO INJURY BUT TO THE HEAD.

IT NOW BECAME NECESSARY FOR THE PARTY TO CONSIDER WHAT WAS BEST TO BE
DONE, AS TO THEIR GENERAL SITUATION.  THEY WERE NOW ABLE TO SPEAK TO
EACH OTHER AND CONSULT.  THAT LOUISA MUST REMAIN WHERE SHE WAS, HOWEVER
DISTRESSING TO HER FRIENDS TO BE INVOLVING THE HARVILLES IN SUCH
TROUBLE, DID NOT ADMIT A DOUBT.  HER REMOVAL WAS IMPOSSIBLE.  THE
HARVILLES SILENCED ALL SCRUPLES; AND, AS MUCH AS THEY COULD, ALL
GRATITUDE.  THEY HAD LOOKED FORWARD AND ARRANGED EVERYTHING BEFORE THE
OTHERS BEGAN TO REFLECT.  CAPTAIN BENWICK MUST GIVE UP HIS ROOM TO
THEM, AND GET ANOTHER BED ELSEWHERE; AND THE WHOLE WAS SETTLED.  THEY
WERE ONLY CONCERNED THAT THE HOUSE COULD ACCOMMODATE NO MORE; AND YET
PERHAPS, BY "PUTTING THE CHILDREN AWAY IN THE MAID'S ROOM, OR SWINGING
A COT SOMEWHERE," THEY COULD HARDLY BEAR TO THINK OF NOT FINDING ROOM
FOR TWO OR THREE BESIDES, SUPPOSING THEY MIGHT WISH TO STAY; THOUGH,
WITH REGARD TO ANY ATTENDANCE ON MISS MUSGROVE, THERE NEED NOT BE THE
LEAST UNEASINESS IN LEAVING HER TO MRS HARVILLE'S CARE ENTIRELY.  MRS
HARVILLE WAS A VERY EXPERIENCED NURSE, AND HER NURSERY-MAID, WHO HAD
LIVED WITH HER LONG, AND GONE ABOUT WITH HER EVERYWHERE, WAS JUST SUCH
ANOTHER.  BETWEEN THESE TWO, SHE COULD WANT NO POSSIBLE ATTENDANCE BY
DAY OR NIGHT.  AND ALL THIS WAS SAID WITH A TRUTH AND SINCERITY OF
FEELING IRRESISTIBLE.

CHARLES, HENRIETTA, AND CAPTAIN WENTWORTH WERE THE THREE IN
CONSULTATION, AND FOR A LITTLE WHILE IT WAS ONLY AN INTERCHANGE OF
PERPLEXITY AND TERROR.  "UPPERCROSS, THE NECESSITY OF SOME ONE'S GOING
TO UPPERCROSS; THE NEWS TO BE CONVEYED; HOW IT COULD BE BROKEN TO MR
AND MRS MUSGROVE; THE LATENESS OF THE MORNING; AN HOUR ALREADY GONE
SINCE THEY OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN OFF; THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF BEING IN
TOLERABLE TIME." AT FIRST, THEY WERE CAPABLE OF NOTHING MORE TO THE
PURPOSE THAN SUCH EXCLAMATIONS; BUT, AFTER A WHILE, CAPTAIN WENTWORTH,
EXERTING HIMSELF, SAID--

"WE MUST BE DECIDED, AND WITHOUT THE LOSS OF ANOTHER MINUTE.  EVERY
MINUTE IS VALUABLE.  SOME ONE MUST RESOLVE ON BEING OFF FOR UPPERCROSS
INSTANTLY.  MUSGROVE, EITHER YOU OR I MUST GO."

CHARLES AGREED, BUT DECLARED HIS RESOLUTION OF NOT GOING AWAY.  HE
WOULD BE AS LITTLE INCUMBRANCE AS POSSIBLE TO CAPTAIN AND MRS HARVILLE;
BUT AS TO LEAVING HIS SISTER IN SUCH A STATE, HE NEITHER OUGHT, NOR
WOULD.  SO FAR IT WAS DECIDED; AND HENRIETTA AT FIRST DECLARED THE
SAME.  SHE, HOWEVER, WAS SOON PERSUADED TO THINK DIFFERENTLY.  THE
USEFULNESS OF HER STAYING!  SHE WHO HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO REMAIN IN
LOUISA'S ROOM, OR TO LOOK AT HER, WITHOUT SUFFERINGS WHICH MADE HER
WORSE THAN HELPLESS!  SHE WAS FORCED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT SHE COULD DO
NO GOOD, YET WAS STILL UNWILLING TO BE AWAY, TILL, TOUCHED BY THE
THOUGHT OF HER FATHER AND MOTHER, SHE GAVE IT UP; SHE CONSENTED, SHE
WAS ANXIOUS TO BE AT HOME.

THE PLAN HAD REACHED THIS POINT, WHEN ANNE, COMING QUIETLY DOWN FROM
LOUISA'S ROOM, COULD NOT BUT HEAR WHAT FOLLOWED, FOR THE PARLOUR DOOR
WAS OPEN.

"THEN IT IS SETTLED, MUSGROVE," CRIED CAPTAIN WENTWORTH, "THAT YOU
STAY, AND THAT I TAKE CARE OF YOUR SISTER HOME.  BUT AS TO THE REST, AS
TO THE OTHERS, IF ONE STAYS TO ASSIST MRS HARVILLE, I THINK IT NEED BE
ONLY ONE.  MRS CHARLES MUSGROVE WILL, OF COURSE, WISH TO GET BACK TO
HER CHILDREN; BUT IF ANNE WILL STAY, NO ONE SO PROPER, SO CAPABLE AS
ANNE."

SHE PAUSED A MOMENT TO RECOVER FROM THE EMOTION OF HEARING HERSELF SO
SPOKEN OF.  THE OTHER TWO WARMLY AGREED WITH WHAT HE SAID, AND SHE THEN
APPEARED.

"YOU WILL STAY, I AM SURE; YOU WILL STAY AND NURSE HER;" CRIED HE,
TURNING TO HER AND SPEAKING WITH A GLOW, AND YET A GENTLENESS, WHICH
SEEMED ALMOST RESTORING THE PAST.  SHE COLOURED DEEPLY, AND HE
RECOLLECTED HIMSELF AND MOVED AWAY.  SHE EXPRESSED HERSELF MOST
WILLING, READY, HAPPY TO REMAIN.  "IT WAS WHAT SHE HAD BEEN THINKING
OF, AND WISHING TO BE ALLOWED TO DO.  A BED ON THE FLOOR IN LOUISA'S
ROOM WOULD BE SUFFICIENT FOR HER, IF MRS HARVILLE WOULD BUT THINK SO."

ONE THING MORE, AND ALL SEEMED ARRANGED.  THOUGH IT WAS RATHER
DESIRABLE THAT MR AND MRS MUSGROVE SHOULD BE PREVIOUSLY ALARMED BY SOME
SHARE OF DELAY; YET THE TIME REQUIRED BY THE UPPERCROSS HORSES TO TAKE
THEM BACK, WOULD BE A DREADFUL EXTENSION OF SUSPENSE; AND CAPTAIN
WENTWORTH PROPOSED, AND CHARLES MUSGROVE AGREED, THAT IT WOULD BE MUCH
BETTER FOR HIM TO TAKE A CHAISE FROM THE INN, AND LEAVE MR MUSGROVE'S
CARRIAGE AND HORSES TO BE SENT HOME THE NEXT MORNING EARLY, WHEN THERE
WOULD BE THE FARTHER ADVANTAGE OF SENDING AN ACCOUNT OF LOUISA'S NIGHT.

CAPTAIN WENTWORTH NOW HURRIED OFF TO GET EVERYTHING READY ON HIS PART,
AND TO BE SOON FOLLOWED BY THE TWO LADIES.  WHEN THE PLAN WAS MADE
KNOWN TO MARY, HOWEVER, THERE WAS AN END OF ALL PEACE IN IT.  SHE WAS
SO WRETCHED AND SO VEHEMENT, COMPLAINED SO MUCH OF INJUSTICE IN BEING
EXPECTED TO GO AWAY INSTEAD OF ANNE; ANNE, WHO WAS NOTHING TO LOUISA,
WHILE SHE WAS HER SISTER, AND HAD THE BEST RIGHT TO STAY IN HENRIETTA'S
STEAD!  WHY WAS NOT SHE TO BE AS USEFUL AS ANNE?  AND TO GO HOME
WITHOUT CHARLES, TOO, WITHOUT HER HUSBAND!  NO, IT WAS TOO UNKIND.  AND
IN SHORT, SHE SAID MORE THAN HER HUSBAND COULD LONG WITHSTAND, AND AS
NONE OF THE OTHERS COULD OPPOSE WHEN HE GAVE WAY, THERE WAS NO HELP FOR
IT; THE CHANGE OF MARY FOR ANNE WAS INEVITABLE.

ANNE HAD NEVER SUBMITTED MORE RELUCTANTLY TO THE JEALOUS AND
ILL-JUDGING CLAIMS OF MARY; BUT SO IT MUST BE, AND THEY SET OFF FOR THE
TOWN, CHARLES TAKING CARE OF HIS SISTER, AND CAPTAIN BENWICK ATTENDING
TO HER.  SHE GAVE A MOMENT'S RECOLLECTION, AS THEY HURRIED ALONG, TO
THE LITTLE CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH THE SAME SPOTS HAD WITNESSED EARLIER IN
THE MORNING.  THERE SHE HAD LISTENED TO HENRIETTA'S SCHEMES FOR DR
SHIRLEY'S LEAVING UPPERCROSS; FARTHER ON, SHE HAD FIRST SEEN MR ELLIOT;
A MOMENT SEEMED ALL THAT COULD NOW BE GIVEN TO ANY ONE BUT LOUISA, OR
THOSE WHO WERE WRAPT UP IN HER WELFARE.

CAPTAIN BENWICK WAS MOST CONSIDERATELY ATTENTIVE TO HER; AND, UNITED AS
THEY ALL SEEMED BY THE DISTRESS OF THE DAY, SHE FELT AN INCREASING
DEGREE OF GOOD-WILL TOWARDS HIM, AND A PLEASURE EVEN IN THINKING THAT
IT MIGHT, PERHAPS, BE THE OCCASION OF CONTINUING THEIR ACQUAINTANCE.

CAPTAIN WENTWORTH WAS ON THE WATCH FOR THEM, AND A CHAISE AND FOUR IN
WAITING, STATIONED FOR THEIR CONVENIENCE IN THE LOWEST PART OF THE
STREET; BUT HIS EVIDENT SURPRISE AND VEXATION AT THE SUBSTITUTION OF
ONE SISTER FOR THE OTHER, THE CHANGE IN HIS COUNTENANCE, THE
ASTONISHMENT, THE EXPRESSIONS BEGUN AND SUPPRESSED, WITH WHICH CHARLES
WAS LISTENED TO, MADE BUT A MORTIFYING RECEPTION OF ANNE; OR MUST AT
LEAST CONVINCE HER THAT SHE WAS VALUED ONLY AS SHE COULD BE USEFUL TO
LOUISA.

SHE ENDEAVOURED TO BE COMPOSED, AND TO BE JUST.  WITHOUT EMULATING THE
FEELINGS OF AN EMMA TOWARDS HER HENRY, SHE WOULD HAVE ATTENDED ON
LOUISA WITH A ZEAL ABOVE THE COMMON CLAIMS OF REGARD, FOR HIS SAKE; AND
SHE HOPED HE WOULD NOT LONG BE SO UNJUST AS TO SUPPOSE SHE WOULD SHRINK
UNNECESSARILY FROM THE OFFICE OF A FRIEND.

IN THE MEAN WHILE SHE WAS IN THE CARRIAGE.  HE HAD HANDED THEM BOTH IN,
AND PLACED HIMSELF BETWEEN THEM; AND IN THIS MANNER, UNDER THESE
CIRCUMSTANCES, FULL OF ASTONISHMENT AND EMOTION TO ANNE, SHE QUITTED
LYME.  HOW THE LONG STAGE WOULD PASS; HOW IT WAS TO AFFECT THEIR
MANNERS; WHAT WAS TO BE THEIR SORT OF INTERCOURSE, SHE COULD NOT
FORESEE.  IT WAS ALL QUITE NATURAL, HOWEVER.  HE WAS DEVOTED TO
HENRIETTA; ALWAYS TURNING TOWARDS HER; AND WHEN HE SPOKE AT ALL, ALWAYS
WITH THE VIEW OF SUPPORTING HER HOPES AND RAISING HER SPIRITS.  IN
GENERAL, HIS VOICE AND MANNER WERE STUDIOUSLY CALM.  TO SPARE HENRIETTA
FROM AGITATION SEEMED THE GOVERNING PRINCIPLE.  ONCE ONLY, WHEN SHE HAD
BEEN GRIEVING OVER THE LAST ILL-JUDGED, ILL-FATED WALK TO THE COBB,
BITTERLY LAMENTING THAT IT EVER HAD BEEN THOUGHT OF, HE BURST FORTH, AS
IF WHOLLY OVERCOME--

"DON'T TALK OF IT, DON'T TALK OF IT," HE CRIED.  "OH GOD! THAT I HAD
NOT GIVEN WAY TO HER AT THE FATAL MOMENT!  HAD I DONE AS I OUGHT!  BUT
SO EAGER AND SO RESOLUTE! DEAR, SWEET LOUISA!"

ANNE WONDERED WHETHER IT EVER OCCURRED TO HIM NOW, TO QUESTION THE
JUSTNESS OF HIS OWN PREVIOUS OPINION AS TO THE UNIVERSAL FELICITY AND
ADVANTAGE OF FIRMNESS OF CHARACTER; AND WHETHER IT MIGHT NOT STRIKE HIM
THAT, LIKE ALL OTHER QUALITIES OF THE MIND, IT SHOULD HAVE ITS
PROPORTIONS AND LIMITS.  SHE THOUGHT IT COULD SCARCELY ESCAPE HIM TO
FEEL THAT A PERSUADABLE TEMPER MIGHT SOMETIMES BE AS MUCH IN FAVOUR OF
HAPPINESS AS A VERY RESOLUTE CHARACTER.

THEY GOT ON FAST.  ANNE WAS ASTONISHED TO RECOGNISE THE SAME HILLS AND
THE SAME OBJECTS SO SOON.  THEIR ACTUAL SPEED, HEIGHTENED BY SOME DREAD
OF THE CONCLUSION, MADE THE ROAD APPEAR BUT HALF AS LONG AS ON THE DAY
BEFORE.  IT WAS GROWING QUITE DUSK, HOWEVER, BEFORE THEY WERE IN THE
NEIGHBOURHOOD OF UPPERCROSS, AND THERE HAD BEEN TOTAL SILENCE AMONG
THEM FOR SOME TIME, HENRIETTA LEANING BACK IN THE CORNER, WITH A SHAWL
OVER HER FACE, GIVING THE HOPE OF HER HAVING CRIED HERSELF TO SLEEP;
WHEN, AS THEY WERE GOING UP THEIR LAST HILL, ANNE FOUND HERSELF ALL AT
ONCE ADDRESSED BY CAPTAIN WENTWORTH.  IN A LOW, CAUTIOUS VOICE, HE
SAID:--

"I HAVE BEEN CONSIDERING WHAT WE HAD BEST DO.  SHE MUST NOT APPEAR AT
FIRST.  SHE COULD NOT STAND IT.  I HAVE BEEN THINKING WHETHER YOU HAD
NOT BETTER REMAIN IN THE CARRIAGE WITH HER, WHILE I GO IN AND BREAK IT
TO MR AND MRS MUSGROVE.  DO YOU THINK THIS IS A GOOD PLAN?"

SHE DID:  HE WAS SATISFIED, AND SAID NO MORE.  BUT THE REMEMBRANCE OF
THE APPEAL REMAINED A PLEASURE TO HER, AS A PROOF OF FRIENDSHIP, AND OF
DEFERENCE FOR HER JUDGEMENT, A GREAT PLEASURE; AND WHEN IT BECAME A
SORT OF PARTING PROOF, ITS VALUE DID NOT LESSEN.

WHEN THE DISTRESSING COMMUNICATION AT UPPERCROSS WAS OVER, AND HE HAD
SEEN THE FATHER AND MOTHER QUITE AS COMPOSED AS COULD BE HOPED, AND THE
DAUGHTER ALL THE BETTER FOR BEING WITH THEM, HE ANNOUNCED HIS INTENTION
OF RETURNING IN THE SAME CARRIAGE TO LYME; AND WHEN THE HORSES WERE
BAITED, HE WAS OFF.

(END OF VOLUME ONE.)



CHAPTER 13


THE REMAINDER OF ANNE'S TIME AT UPPERCROSS, COMPREHENDING ONLY TWO
DAYS, WAS SPENT ENTIRELY AT THE MANSION HOUSE; AND SHE HAD THE
SATISFACTION OF KNOWING HERSELF EXTREMELY USEFUL THERE, BOTH AS AN
IMMEDIATE COMPANION, AND AS ASSISTING IN ALL THOSE ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE
FUTURE, WHICH, IN MR AND MRS MUSGROVE'S DISTRESSED STATE OF SPIRITS,
WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFICULTIES.

THEY HAD AN EARLY ACCOUNT FROM LYME THE NEXT MORNING.  LOUISA WAS MUCH
THE SAME.  NO SYMPTOMS WORSE THAN BEFORE HAD APPEARED.  CHARLES CAME A
FEW HOURS AFTERWARDS, TO BRING A LATER AND MORE PARTICULAR ACCOUNT.  HE
WAS TOLERABLY CHEERFUL.  A SPEEDY CURE MUST NOT BE HOPED, BUT
EVERYTHING WAS GOING ON AS WELL AS THE NATURE OF THE CASE ADMITTED.  IN
SPEAKING OF THE HARVILLES, HE SEEMED UNABLE TO SATISFY HIS OWN SENSE OF
THEIR KINDNESS, ESPECIALLY OF MRS HARVILLE'S EXERTIONS AS A NURSE.
"SHE REALLY LEFT NOTHING FOR MARY TO DO.  HE AND MARY HAD BEEN
PERSUADED TO GO EARLY TO THEIR INN LAST NIGHT.  MARY HAD BEEN
HYSTERICAL AGAIN THIS MORNING.  WHEN HE CAME AWAY, SHE WAS GOING TO
WALK OUT WITH CAPTAIN BENWICK, WHICH, HE HOPED, WOULD DO HER GOOD.  HE
ALMOST WISHED SHE HAD BEEN PREVAILED ON TO COME HOME THE DAY BEFORE;
BUT THE TRUTH WAS, THAT MRS HARVILLE LEFT NOTHING FOR ANYBODY TO DO."

CHARLES WAS TO RETURN TO LYME THE SAME AFTERNOON, AND HIS FATHER HAD AT
FIRST HALF A MIND TO GO WITH HIM, BUT THE LADIES COULD NOT CONSENT.  IT
WOULD BE GOING ONLY TO MULTIPLY TROUBLE TO THE OTHERS, AND INCREASE HIS
OWN DISTRESS; AND A MUCH BETTER SCHEME FOLLOWED AND WAS ACTED UPON.  A
CHAISE WAS SENT FOR FROM CREWKHERNE, AND CHARLES CONVEYED BACK A FAR
MORE USEFUL PERSON IN THE OLD NURSERY-MAID OF THE FAMILY, ONE WHO
HAVING BROUGHT UP ALL THE CHILDREN, AND SEEN THE VERY LAST, THE
LINGERING AND LONG-PETTED MASTER HARRY, SENT TO SCHOOL AFTER HIS
BROTHERS, WAS NOW LIVING IN HER DESERTED NURSERY TO MEND STOCKINGS AND
DRESS ALL THE BLAINS AND BRUISES SHE COULD GET NEAR HER, AND WHO,
CONSEQUENTLY, WAS ONLY TOO HAPPY IN BEING ALLOWED TO GO AND HELP NURSE
DEAR MISS LOUISA.  VAGUE WISHES OF GETTING SARAH THITHER, HAD OCCURRED
BEFORE TO MRS MUSGROVE AND HENRIETTA; BUT WITHOUT ANNE, IT WOULD HARDLY
HAVE BEEN RESOLVED ON, AND FOUND PRACTICABLE SO SOON.

THEY WERE INDEBTED, THE NEXT DAY, TO CHARLES HAYTER, FOR ALL THE MINUTE
KNOWLEDGE OF LOUISA, WHICH IT WAS SO ESSENTIAL TO OBTAIN EVERY
TWENTY-FOUR HOURS.  HE MADE IT HIS BUSINESS TO GO TO LYME, AND HIS
ACCOUNT WAS STILL ENCOURAGING.  THE INTERVALS OF SENSE AND
CONSCIOUSNESS WERE BELIEVED TO BE STRONGER.  EVERY REPORT AGREED IN
CAPTAIN WENTWORTH'S APPEARING FIXED IN LYME.

ANNE WAS TO LEAVE THEM ON THE MORROW, AN EVENT WHICH THEY ALL DREADED.
"WHAT SHOULD THEY DO WITHOUT HER?  THEY WERE WRETCHED COMFORTERS FOR
ONE ANOTHER."  AND SO MUCH WAS SAID IN THIS WAY, THAT ANNE THOUGHT SHE
COULD NOT DO BETTER THAN IMPART AMONG THEM THE GENERAL INCLINATION TO
WHICH SHE WAS PRIVY, AND PERSUADED THEM ALL TO GO TO LYME AT ONCE.  SHE
HAD LITTLE DIFFICULTY; IT WAS SOON DETERMINED THAT THEY WOULD GO; GO
TO-MORROW, FIX THEMSELVES AT THE INN, OR GET INTO LODGINGS, AS IT
SUITED, AND THERE REMAIN TILL DEAR LOUISA COULD BE MOVED.  THEY MUST BE
TAKING OFF SOME TROUBLE FROM THE GOOD PEOPLE SHE WAS WITH; THEY MIGHT
AT LEAST RELIEVE MRS HARVILLE FROM THE CARE OF HER OWN CHILDREN; AND IN
SHORT, THEY WERE SO HAPPY IN THE DECISION, THAT ANNE WAS DELIGHTED WITH
WHAT SHE HAD DONE, AND FELT THAT SHE COULD NOT SPEND HER LAST MORNING
AT UPPERCROSS BETTER THAN IN ASSISTING THEIR PREPARATIONS, AND SENDING
THEM OFF AT AN EARLY HOUR, THOUGH HER BEING LEFT TO THE SOLITARY RANGE
OF THE HOUSE WAS THE CONSEQUENCE.

SHE WAS THE LAST, EXCEPTING THE LITTLE BOYS AT THE COTTAGE, SHE WAS THE
VERY LAST, THE ONLY REMAINING ONE OF ALL THAT HAD FILLED AND ANIMATED
BOTH HOUSES, OF ALL THAT HAD GIVEN UPPERCROSS ITS CHEERFUL CHARACTER.
A FEW DAYS HAD MADE A CHANGE INDEED!

IF LOUISA RECOVERED, IT WOULD ALL BE WELL AGAIN.  MORE THAN FORMER
HAPPINESS WOULD BE RESTORED.  THERE COULD NOT BE A DOUBT, TO HER MIND
THERE WAS NONE, OF WHAT WOULD FOLLOW HER RECOVERY.  A FEW MONTHS HENCE,
AND THE ROOM NOW SO DESERTED, OCCUPIED BUT BY HER SILENT, PENSIVE SELF,
MIGHT BE FILLED AGAIN WITH ALL THAT WAS HAPPY AND GAY, ALL THAT WAS
GLOWING AND BRIGHT IN PROSPEROUS LOVE, ALL THAT WAS MOST UNLIKE ANNE
ELLIOT!

AN HOUR'S COMPLETE LEISURE FOR SUCH REFLECTIONS AS THESE, ON A DARK
NOVEMBER DAY, A SMALL THICK RAIN ALMOST BLOTTING OUT THE VERY FEW
OBJECTS EVER TO BE DISCERNED FROM THE WINDOWS, WAS ENOUGH TO MAKE THE
SOUND OF LADY RUSSELL'S CARRIAGE EXCEEDINGLY WELCOME; AND YET, THOUGH
DESIROUS TO BE GONE, SHE COULD NOT QUIT THE MANSION HOUSE, OR LOOK AN
ADIEU TO THE COTTAGE, WITH ITS BLACK, DRIPPING AND COMFORTLESS VERANDA,
OR EVEN NOTICE THROUGH THE MISTY GLASSES THE LAST HUMBLE TENEMENTS OF
THE VILLAGE, WITHOUT A SADDENED HEART.  SCENES HAD PASSED IN UPPERCROSS
WHICH MADE IT PRECIOUS.  IT STOOD THE RECORD OF MANY SENSATIONS OF
PAIN, ONCE SEVERE, BUT NOW SOFTENED; AND OF SOME INSTANCES OF RELENTING
FEELING, SOME BREATHINGS OF FRIENDSHIP AND RECONCILIATION, WHICH COULD
NEVER BE LOOKED FOR AGAIN, AND WHICH COULD NEVER CEASE TO BE DEAR.  SHE
LEFT IT ALL BEHIND HER, ALL BUT THE RECOLLECTION THAT SUCH THINGS HAD
BEEN.

ANNE HAD NEVER ENTERED KELLYNCH SINCE HER QUITTING LADY RUSSELL'S HOUSE
IN SEPTEMBER.  IT HAD NOT BEEN NECESSARY, AND THE FEW OCCASIONS OF ITS
BEING POSSIBLE FOR HER TO GO TO THE HALL SHE HAD CONTRIVED TO EVADE AND
ESCAPE FROM.  HER FIRST RETURN WAS TO RESUME HER PLACE IN THE MODERN
AND ELEGANT APARTMENTS OF THE LODGE, AND TO GLADDEN THE EYES OF ITS
MISTRESS.

THERE WAS SOME ANXIETY MIXED WITH LADY RUSSELL'S JOY IN MEETING HER.
SHE KNEW WHO HAD BEEN FREQUENTING UPPERCROSS.  BUT HAPPILY, EITHER ANNE
WAS IMPROVED IN PLUMPNESS AND LOOKS, OR LADY RUSSELL FANCIED HER SO;
AND ANNE, IN RECEIVING HER COMPLIMENTS ON THE OCCASION, HAD THE
AMUSEMENT OF CONNECTING THEM WITH THE SILENT ADMIRATION OF HER COUSIN,
AND OF HOPING THAT SHE WAS TO BE BLESSED WITH A SECOND SPRING OF YOUTH
AND BEAUTY.

WHEN THEY CAME TO CONVERSE, SHE WAS SOON SENSIBLE OF SOME MENTAL
CHANGE.  THE SUBJECTS OF WHICH HER HEART HAD BEEN FULL ON LEAVING
KELLYNCH, AND WHICH SHE HAD FELT SLIGHTED, AND BEEN COMPELLED TO
SMOTHER AMONG THE MUSGROVES, WERE NOW BECOME BUT OF SECONDARY INTEREST.
SHE HAD LATELY LOST SIGHT EVEN OF HER FATHER AND SISTER AND BATH.
THEIR CONCERNS HAD BEEN SUNK UNDER THOSE OF UPPERCROSS; AND WHEN LADY
RUSSELL REVERTED TO THEIR FORMER HOPES AND FEARS, AND SPOKE HER
SATISFACTION IN THE HOUSE IN CAMDEN PLACE, WHICH HAD BEEN TAKEN, AND
HER REGRET THAT MRS CLAY SHOULD STILL BE WITH THEM, ANNE WOULD HAVE
BEEN ASHAMED TO HAVE IT KNOWN HOW MUCH MORE SHE WAS THINKING OF LYME
AND LOUISA MUSGROVE, AND ALL HER ACQUAINTANCE THERE; HOW MUCH MORE
INTERESTING TO HER WAS THE HOME AND THE FRIENDSHIP OF THE HARVILLES AND
CAPTAIN BENWICK, THAN HER OWN FATHER'S HOUSE IN CAMDEN PLACE, OR HER
OWN SISTER'S INTIMACY WITH MRS CLAY.  SHE WAS ACTUALLY FORCED TO EXERT
HERSELF TO MEET LADY RUSSELL WITH ANYTHING LIKE THE APPEARANCE OF EQUAL
SOLICITUDE, ON TOPICS WHICH HAD BY NATURE THE FIRST CLAIM ON HER.

THERE WAS A LITTLE AWKWARDNESS AT FIRST IN THEIR DISCOURSE ON ANOTHER
SUBJECT.  THEY MUST SPEAK OF THE ACCIDENT AT LYME.  LADY RUSSELL HAD
NOT BEEN ARRIVED FIVE MINUTES THE DAY BEFORE, WHEN A FULL ACCOUNT OF
THE WHOLE HAD BURST ON HER; BUT STILL IT MUST BE TALKED OF, SHE MUST
MAKE ENQUIRIES, SHE MUST REGRET THE IMPRUDENCE, LAMENT THE RESULT, AND
CAPTAIN WENTWORTH'S NAME MUST BE MENTIONED BY BOTH.  ANNE WAS CONSCIOUS
OF NOT DOING IT SO WELL AS LADY RUSSELL.  SHE COULD NOT SPEAK THE NAME,
AND LOOK STRAIGHT FORWARD TO LADY RUSSELL'S EYE, TILL SHE HAD ADOPTED
THE EXPEDIENT OF TELLING HER BRIEFLY WHAT SHE THOUGHT OF THE ATTACHMENT
BETWEEN HIM AND LOUISA.  WHEN THIS WAS TOLD, HIS NAME DISTRESSED HER NO
LONGER.

LADY RUSSELL HAD ONLY TO LISTEN COMPOSEDLY, AND WISH THEM HAPPY, BUT
INTERNALLY HER HEART REVELLED IN ANGRY PLEASURE, IN PLEASED CONTEMPT,
THAT THE MAN WHO AT TWENTY-THREE HAD SEEMED TO UNDERSTAND SOMEWHAT OF
THE VALUE OF AN ANNE ELLIOT, SHOULD, EIGHT YEARS AFTERWARDS, BE CHARMED
BY A LOUISA MUSGROVE.

THE FIRST THREE OR FOUR DAYS PASSED MOST QUIETLY, WITH NO CIRCUMSTANCE
TO MARK THEM EXCEPTING THE RECEIPT OF A NOTE OR TWO FROM LYME, WHICH
FOUND THEIR WAY TO ANNE, SHE COULD NOT TELL HOW, AND BROUGHT A RATHER
IMPROVING ACCOUNT OF LOUISA.  AT THE END OF THAT PERIOD, LADY RUSSELL'S
POLITENESS COULD REPOSE NO LONGER, AND THE FAINTER SELF-THREATENINGS OF
THE PAST BECAME IN A DECIDED TONE, "I MUST CALL ON MRS CROFT; I REALLY
MUST CALL UPON HER SOON.  ANNE, HAVE YOU COURAGE TO GO WITH ME, AND PAY
A VISIT IN THAT HOUSE?  IT WILL BE SOME TRIAL TO US BOTH."

ANNE DID NOT SHRINK FROM IT; ON THE CONTRARY, SHE TRULY FELT AS SHE
SAID, IN OBSERVING--

"I THINK YOU ARE VERY LIKELY TO SUFFER THE MOST OF THE TWO; YOUR
FEELINGS ARE LESS RECONCILED TO THE CHANGE THAN MINE.  BY REMAINING IN
THE NEIGHBOURHOOD, I AM BECOME INURED TO IT."

SHE COULD HAVE SAID MORE ON THE SUBJECT; FOR SHE HAD IN FACT SO HIGH AN
OPINION OF THE CROFTS, AND CONSIDERED HER FATHER SO VERY FORTUNATE IN
HIS TENANTS, FELT THE PARISH TO BE SO SURE OF A GOOD EXAMPLE, AND THE
POOR OF THE BEST ATTENTION AND RELIEF, THAT HOWEVER SORRY AND ASHAMED
FOR THE NECESSITY OF THE REMOVAL, SHE COULD NOT BUT IN CONSCIENCE FEEL
THAT THEY WERE GONE WHO DESERVED NOT TO STAY, AND THAT KELLYNCH HALL
HAD PASSED INTO BETTER HANDS THAN ITS OWNERS'.  THESE CONVICTIONS MUST
UNQUESTIONABLY HAVE THEIR OWN PAIN, AND SEVERE WAS ITS KIND; BUT THEY
PRECLUDED THAT PAIN WHICH LADY RUSSELL WOULD SUFFER IN ENTERING THE
HOUSE AGAIN, AND RETURNING THROUGH THE WELL-KNOWN APARTMENTS.

IN SUCH MOMENTS ANNE HAD NO POWER OF SAYING TO HERSELF, "THESE ROOMS
OUGHT TO BELONG ONLY TO US.  OH, HOW FALLEN IN THEIR DESTINATION!  HOW
UNWORTHILY OCCUPIED!  AN ANCIENT FAMILY TO BE SO DRIVEN AWAY!
STRANGERS FILLING THEIR PLACE!" NO, EXCEPT WHEN SHE THOUGHT OF HER
MOTHER, AND REMEMBERED WHERE SHE HAD BEEN USED TO SIT AND PRESIDE, SHE
HAD NO SIGH OF THAT DESCRIPTION TO HEAVE.

MRS CROFT ALWAYS MET HER WITH A KINDNESS WHICH GAVE HER THE PLEASURE OF
FANCYING HERSELF A FAVOURITE, AND ON THE PRESENT OCCASION, RECEIVING
HER IN THAT HOUSE, THERE WAS PARTICULAR ATTENTION.

THE SAD ACCIDENT AT LYME WAS SOON THE PREVAILING TOPIC, AND ON
COMPARING THEIR LATEST ACCOUNTS OF THE INVALID, IT APPEARED THAT EACH
LADY DATED HER INTELLIGENCE FROM THE SAME HOUR OF YESTERMORN; THAT
CAPTAIN WENTWORTH HAD BEEN IN KELLYNCH YESTERDAY (THE FIRST TIME SINCE
THE ACCIDENT), HAD BROUGHT ANNE THE LAST NOTE, WHICH SHE HAD NOT BEEN
ABLE TO TRACE THE EXACT STEPS OF; HAD STAID A FEW HOURS AND THEN
RETURNED AGAIN TO LYME, AND WITHOUT ANY PRESENT INTENTION OF QUITTING
IT ANY MORE.  HE HAD ENQUIRED AFTER HER, SHE FOUND, PARTICULARLY; HAD
EXPRESSED HIS HOPE OF MISS ELLIOT'S NOT BEING THE WORSE FOR HER
EXERTIONS, AND HAD SPOKEN OF THOSE EXERTIONS AS GREAT.  THIS WAS
HANDSOME, AND GAVE HER MORE PLEASURE THAN ALMOST ANYTHING ELSE COULD
HAVE DONE.

AS TO THE SAD CATASTROPHE ITSELF, IT COULD BE CANVASSED ONLY IN ONE
STYLE BY A COUPLE OF STEADY, SENSIBLE WOMEN, WHOSE JUDGEMENTS HAD TO
WORK ON ASCERTAINED EVENTS; AND IT WAS PERFECTLY DECIDED THAT IT HAD
BEEN THE CONSEQUENCE OF MUCH THOUGHTLESSNESS AND MUCH IMPRUDENCE; THAT
ITS EFFECTS WERE MOST ALARMING, AND THAT IT WAS FRIGHTFUL TO THINK, HOW
LONG MISS MUSGROVE'S RECOVERY MIGHT YET BE DOUBTFUL, AND HOW LIABLE SHE
WOULD STILL REMAIN TO SUFFER FROM THE CONCUSSION HEREAFTER!  THE
ADMIRAL WOUND IT UP SUMMARILY BY EXCLAIMING--

"AY, A VERY BAD BUSINESS INDEED.  A NEW SORT OF WAY THIS, FOR A YOUNG
FELLOW TO BE MAKING LOVE, BY BREAKING HIS MISTRESS'S HEAD, IS NOT IT,
MISS ELLIOT?  THIS IS BREAKING A HEAD AND GIVING A PLASTER, TRULY!"

ADMIRAL CROFT'S MANNERS WERE NOT QUITE OF THE TONE TO SUIT LADY
RUSSELL, BUT THEY DELIGHTED ANNE.  HIS GOODNESS OF HEART AND SIMPLICITY
OF CHARACTER WERE IRRESISTIBLE.

"NOW, THIS MUST BE VERY BAD FOR YOU," SAID HE, SUDDENLY ROUSING FROM A
LITTLE REVERIE, "TO BE COMING AND FINDING US HERE.  I HAD NOT
RECOLLECTED IT BEFORE, I DECLARE, BUT IT MUST BE VERY BAD.  BUT NOW, DO
NOT STAND UPON CEREMONY.  GET UP AND GO OVER ALL THE ROOMS IN THE HOUSE
IF YOU LIKE IT."

"ANOTHER TIME, SIR, I THANK YOU, NOT NOW."

"WELL, WHENEVER IT SUITS YOU.  YOU CAN SLIP IN FROM THE SHRUBBERY AT
ANY TIME; AND THERE YOU WILL FIND WE KEEP OUR UMBRELLAS HANGING UP BY
THAT DOOR.  A GOOD PLACE IS NOT IT?  BUT," (CHECKING HIMSELF), "YOU
WILL NOT THINK IT A GOOD PLACE, FOR YOURS WERE ALWAYS KEPT IN THE
BUTLER'S ROOM.  AY, SO IT ALWAYS IS, I BELIEVE.  ONE MAN'S WAYS MAY BE
AS GOOD AS ANOTHER'S, BUT WE ALL LIKE OUR OWN BEST.  AND SO YOU MUST
JUDGE FOR YOURSELF, WHETHER IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR YOU TO GO ABOUT THE
HOUSE OR NOT."

ANNE, FINDING SHE MIGHT DECLINE IT, DID SO, VERY GRATEFULLY.

"WE HAVE MADE VERY FEW CHANGES EITHER," CONTINUED THE ADMIRAL, AFTER
THINKING A MOMENT.  "VERY FEW.  WE TOLD YOU ABOUT THE LAUNDRY-DOOR, AT
UPPERCROSS.  THAT HAS BEEN A VERY GREAT IMPROVEMENT.  THE WONDER WAS,
HOW ANY FAMILY UPON EARTH COULD BEAR WITH THE INCONVENIENCE OF ITS
OPENING AS IT DID, SO LONG!  YOU WILL TELL SIR WALTER WHAT WE HAVE
DONE, AND THAT MR SHEPHERD THINKS IT THE GREATEST IMPROVEMENT THE HOUSE
EVER HAD.  INDEED, I MUST DO OURSELVES THE JUSTICE TO SAY, THAT THE FEW
ALTERATIONS WE HAVE MADE HAVE BEEN ALL VERY MUCH FOR THE BETTER.  MY
WIFE SHOULD HAVE THE CREDIT OF THEM, HOWEVER.  I HAVE DONE VERY LITTLE
BESIDES SENDING AWAY SOME OF THE LARGE LOOKING-GLASSES FROM MY
DRESSING-ROOM, WHICH WAS YOUR FATHER'S.  A VERY GOOD MAN, AND VERY MUCH
THE GENTLEMAN I AM SURE: BUT I SHOULD THINK, MISS ELLIOT," (LOOKING
WITH SERIOUS REFLECTION), "I SHOULD THINK HE MUST BE RATHER A DRESSY
MAN FOR HIS TIME OF LIFE.  SUCH A NUMBER OF LOOKING-GLASSES! OH LORD!
THERE WAS NO GETTING AWAY FROM ONE'S SELF.  SO I GOT SOPHY TO LEND ME A
HAND, AND WE SOON SHIFTED THEIR QUARTERS; AND NOW I AM QUITE SNUG, WITH
MY LITTLE SHAVING GLASS IN ONE CORNER, AND ANOTHER GREAT THING THAT I
NEVER GO NEAR."

ANNE, AMUSED IN SPITE OF HERSELF, WAS RATHER DISTRESSED FOR AN ANSWER,
AND THE ADMIRAL, FEARING HE MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN CIVIL ENOUGH, TOOK UP
THE SUBJECT AGAIN, TO SAY--

"THE NEXT TIME YOU WRITE TO YOUR GOOD FATHER, MISS ELLIOT, PRAY GIVE
HIM MY COMPLIMENTS AND MRS CROFT'S, AND SAY THAT WE ARE SETTLED HERE
QUITE TO OUR LIKING, AND HAVE NO FAULT AT ALL TO FIND WITH THE PLACE.
THE BREAKFAST-ROOM CHIMNEY SMOKES A LITTLE, I GRANT YOU, BUT IT IS ONLY
WHEN THE WIND IS DUE NORTH AND BLOWS HARD, WHICH MAY NOT HAPPEN THREE
TIMES A WINTER.  AND TAKE IT ALTOGETHER, NOW THAT WE HAVE BEEN INTO
MOST OF THE HOUSES HEREABOUTS AND CAN JUDGE, THERE IS NOT ONE THAT WE
LIKE BETTER THAN THIS.  PRAY SAY SO, WITH MY COMPLIMENTS.  HE WILL BE
GLAD TO HEAR IT."

LADY RUSSELL AND MRS CROFT WERE VERY WELL PLEASED WITH EACH OTHER: BUT
THE ACQUAINTANCE WHICH THIS VISIT BEGAN WAS FATED NOT TO PROCEED FAR AT
PRESENT; FOR WHEN IT WAS RETURNED, THE CROFTS ANNOUNCED THEMSELVES TO
BE GOING AWAY FOR A FEW WEEKS, TO VISIT THEIR CONNEXIONS IN THE NORTH
OF THE COUNTY, AND PROBABLY MIGHT NOT BE AT HOME AGAIN BEFORE LADY
RUSSELL WOULD BE REMOVING TO BATH.

SO ENDED ALL DANGER TO ANNE OF MEETING CAPTAIN WENTWORTH AT KELLYNCH
HALL, OR OF SEEING HIM IN COMPANY WITH HER FRIEND.  EVERYTHING WAS SAFE
ENOUGH, AND SHE SMILED OVER THE MANY ANXIOUS FEELINGS SHE HAD WASTED ON
THE SUBJECT.



CHAPTER 14


THOUGH CHARLES AND MARY HAD REMAINED AT LYME MUCH LONGER AFTER MR AND
MRS MUSGROVE'S GOING THAN ANNE CONCEIVED THEY COULD HAVE BEEN AT ALL
WANTED, THEY WERE YET THE FIRST OF THE FAMILY TO BE AT HOME AGAIN; AND
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AFTER THEIR RETURN TO UPPERCROSS THEY DROVE OVER TO
THE LODGE.  THEY HAD LEFT LOUISA BEGINNING TO SIT UP; BUT HER HEAD,
THOUGH CLEAR, WAS EXCEEDINGLY WEAK, AND HER NERVES SUSCEPTIBLE TO THE
HIGHEST EXTREME OF TENDERNESS; AND THOUGH SHE MIGHT BE PRONOUNCED TO BE
ALTOGETHER DOING VERY WELL, IT WAS STILL IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY WHEN SHE
MIGHT BE ABLE TO BEAR THE REMOVAL HOME; AND HER FATHER AND MOTHER, WHO
MUST RETURN IN TIME TO RECEIVE THEIR YOUNGER CHILDREN FOR THE CHRISTMAS
HOLIDAYS, HAD HARDLY A HOPE OF BEING ALLOWED TO BRING HER WITH THEM.

THEY HAD BEEN ALL IN LODGINGS TOGETHER.  MRS MUSGROVE HAD GOT MRS
HARVILLE'S CHILDREN AWAY AS MUCH AS SHE COULD, EVERY POSSIBLE SUPPLY
FROM UPPERCROSS HAD BEEN FURNISHED, TO LIGHTEN THE INCONVENIENCE TO THE
HARVILLES, WHILE THE HARVILLES HAD BEEN WANTING THEM TO COME TO DINNER
EVERY DAY; AND IN SHORT, IT SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN ONLY A STRUGGLE ON EACH
SIDE AS TO WHICH SHOULD BE MOST DISINTERESTED AND HOSPITABLE.

MARY HAD HAD HER EVILS; BUT UPON THE WHOLE, AS WAS EVIDENT BY HER
STAYING SO LONG, SHE HAD FOUND MORE TO ENJOY THAN TO SUFFER.  CHARLES
HAYTER HAD BEEN AT LYME OFTENER THAN SUITED HER; AND WHEN THEY DINED
WITH THE HARVILLES THERE HAD BEEN ONLY A MAID-SERVANT TO WAIT, AND AT
FIRST MRS HARVILLE HAD ALWAYS GIVEN MRS MUSGROVE PRECEDENCE; BUT THEN,
SHE HAD RECEIVED SO VERY HANDSOME AN APOLOGY FROM HER ON FINDING OUT
WHOSE DAUGHTER SHE WAS, AND THERE HAD BEEN SO MUCH GOING ON EVERY DAY,
THERE HAD BEEN SO MANY WALKS BETWEEN THEIR LODGINGS AND THE HARVILLES,
AND SHE HAD GOT BOOKS FROM THE LIBRARY, AND CHANGED THEM SO OFTEN, THAT
THE BALANCE HAD CERTAINLY BEEN MUCH IN FAVOUR OF LYME.  SHE HAD BEEN
TAKEN TO CHARMOUTH TOO, AND SHE HAD BATHED, AND SHE HAD GONE TO CHURCH,
AND THERE WERE A GREAT MANY MORE PEOPLE TO LOOK AT IN THE CHURCH AT
LYME THAN AT UPPERCROSS; AND ALL THIS, JOINED TO THE SENSE OF BEING SO
VERY USEFUL, HAD MADE REALLY AN AGREEABLE FORTNIGHT.

ANNE ENQUIRED AFTER CAPTAIN BENWICK, MARY'S FACE WAS CLOUDED DIRECTLY.
CHARLES LAUGHED.

"OH! CAPTAIN BENWICK IS VERY WELL, I BELIEVE, BUT HE IS A VERY ODD
YOUNG MAN.  I DO NOT KNOW WHAT HE WOULD BE AT.  WE ASKED HIM TO COME
HOME WITH US FOR A DAY OR TWO:  CHARLES UNDERTOOK TO GIVE HIM SOME
SHOOTING, AND HE SEEMED QUITE DELIGHTED, AND, FOR MY PART, I THOUGHT IT
WAS ALL SETTLED; WHEN BEHOLD! ON TUESDAY NIGHT, HE MADE A VERY AWKWARD
SORT OF EXCUSE; 'HE NEVER SHOT' AND HE HAD 'BEEN QUITE MISUNDERSTOOD,'
AND HE HAD PROMISED THIS AND HE HAD PROMISED THAT, AND THE END OF IT
WAS, I FOUND, THAT HE DID NOT MEAN TO COME.  I SUPPOSE HE WAS AFRAID OF
FINDING IT DULL; BUT UPON MY WORD I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT WE WERE LIVELY
ENOUGH AT THE COTTAGE FOR SUCH A HEART-BROKEN MAN AS CAPTAIN BENWICK."

CHARLES LAUGHED AGAIN AND SAID, "NOW MARY, YOU KNOW VERY WELL HOW IT
REALLY WAS.  IT WAS ALL YOUR DOING," (TURNING TO ANNE.) "HE FANCIED
THAT IF HE WENT WITH US, HE SHOULD FIND YOU CLOSE BY: HE FANCIED
EVERYBODY TO BE LIVING IN UPPERCROSS; AND WHEN HE DISCOVERED THAT LADY
RUSSELL LIVED THREE MILES OFF, HIS HEART FAILED HIM, AND HE HAD NOT
COURAGE TO COME.  THAT IS THE FACT, UPON MY HONOUR, MARY KNOWS IT IS."

BUT MARY DID NOT GIVE INTO IT VERY GRACIOUSLY, WHETHER FROM NOT
CONSIDERING CAPTAIN BENWICK ENTITLED BY BIRTH AND SITUATION TO BE IN
LOVE WITH AN ELLIOT, OR FROM NOT WANTING TO BELIEVE ANNE A GREATER
ATTRACTION TO UPPERCROSS THAN HERSELF, MUST BE LEFT TO BE GUESSED.
ANNE'S GOOD-WILL, HOWEVER, WAS NOT TO BE LESSENED BY WHAT SHE HEARD.
SHE BOLDLY ACKNOWLEDGED HERSELF FLATTERED, AND CONTINUED HER ENQUIRIES.

"OH! HE TALKS OF YOU," CRIED CHARLES, "IN SUCH TERMS--" MARY
INTERRUPTED HIM. "I DECLARE, CHARLES, I NEVER HEARD HIM MENTION ANNE
TWICE ALL THE TIME I WAS THERE.  I DECLARE, ANNE, HE NEVER TALKS OF YOU
AT ALL."

"NO," ADMITTED CHARLES, "I DO NOT KNOW THAT HE EVER DOES, IN A GENERAL
WAY; BUT HOWEVER, IT IS A VERY CLEAR THING THAT HE ADMIRES YOU
EXCEEDINGLY.  HIS HEAD IS FULL OF SOME BOOKS THAT HE IS READING UPON
YOUR RECOMMENDATION, AND HE WANTS TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THEM; HE HAS
FOUND OUT SOMETHING OR OTHER IN ONE OF THEM WHICH HE THINKS--OH! I
CANNOT PRETEND TO REMEMBER IT, BUT IT WAS SOMETHING VERY FINE--I
OVERHEARD HIM TELLING HENRIETTA ALL ABOUT IT; AND THEN 'MISS ELLIOT'
WAS SPOKEN OF IN THE HIGHEST TERMS!  NOW MARY, I DECLARE IT WAS SO, I
HEARD IT MYSELF, AND YOU WERE IN THE OTHER ROOM.  'ELEGANCE, SWEETNESS,
BEAUTY.' OH! THERE WAS NO END OF MISS ELLIOT'S CHARMS."

"AND I AM SURE," CRIED MARY, WARMLY, "IT WAS A VERY LITTLE TO HIS
CREDIT, IF HE DID.  MISS HARVILLE ONLY DIED LAST JUNE.  SUCH A HEART IS
VERY LITTLE WORTH HAVING; IS IT, LADY RUSSELL?  I AM SURE YOU WILL
AGREE WITH ME."

"I MUST SEE CAPTAIN BENWICK BEFORE I DECIDE," SAID LADY RUSSELL,
SMILING.

"AND THAT YOU ARE VERY LIKELY TO DO VERY SOON, I CAN TELL YOU, MA'AM,"
SAID CHARLES.  "THOUGH HE HAD NOT NERVES FOR COMING AWAY WITH US, AND
SETTING OFF AGAIN AFTERWARDS TO PAY A FORMAL VISIT HERE, HE WILL MAKE
HIS WAY OVER TO KELLYNCH ONE DAY BY HIMSELF, YOU MAY DEPEND ON IT.  I
TOLD HIM THE DISTANCE AND THE ROAD, AND I TOLD HIM OF THE CHURCH'S
BEING SO VERY WELL WORTH SEEING; FOR AS HE HAS A TASTE FOR THOSE SORT
OF THINGS, I THOUGHT THAT WOULD BE A GOOD EXCUSE, AND HE LISTENED WITH
ALL HIS UNDERSTANDING AND SOUL; AND I AM SURE FROM HIS MANNER THAT YOU
WILL HAVE HIM CALLING HERE SOON.  SO, I GIVE YOU NOTICE, LADY RUSSELL."

"ANY ACQUAINTANCE OF ANNE'S WILL ALWAYS BE WELCOME TO ME," WAS LADY
RUSSELL'S KIND ANSWER.

"OH! AS TO BEING ANNE'S ACQUAINTANCE," SAID MARY, "I THINK HE IS RATHER
MY ACQUAINTANCE, FOR I HAVE BEEN SEEING HIM EVERY DAY THIS LAST
FORTNIGHT."

"WELL, AS YOUR JOINT ACQUAINTANCE, THEN, I SHALL BE VERY HAPPY TO SEE
CAPTAIN BENWICK."

"YOU WILL NOT FIND ANYTHING VERY AGREEABLE IN HIM, I ASSURE YOU, MA'AM.
HE IS ONE OF THE DULLEST YOUNG MEN THAT EVER LIVED.  HE HAS WALKED WITH
ME, SOMETIMES, FROM ONE END OF THE SANDS TO THE OTHER, WITHOUT SAYING A
WORD.  HE IS NOT AT ALL A WELL-BRED YOUNG MAN.  I AM SURE YOU WILL NOT
LIKE HIM."

"THERE WE DIFFER, MARY," SAID ANNE.  "I THINK LADY RUSSELL WOULD LIKE
HIM.  I THINK SHE WOULD BE SO MUCH PLEASED WITH HIS MIND, THAT SHE
WOULD VERY SOON SEE NO DEFICIENCY IN HIS MANNER."

"SO DO I, ANNE," SAID CHARLES.  "I AM SURE LADY RUSSELL WOULD LIKE HIM.
HE IS JUST LADY RUSSELL'S SORT.  GIVE HIM A BOOK, AND HE WILL READ ALL
DAY LONG."

"YES, THAT HE WILL!" EXCLAIMED MARY, TAUNTINGLY.  "HE WILL SIT PORING
OVER HIS BOOK, AND NOT KNOW WHEN A PERSON SPEAKS TO HIM, OR WHEN ONE
DROP'S ONE'S SCISSORS, OR ANYTHING THAT HAPPENS.  DO YOU THINK LADY
RUSSELL WOULD LIKE THAT?"

LADY RUSSELL COULD NOT HELP LAUGHING.  "UPON MY WORD," SAID SHE, "I
SHOULD NOT HAVE SUPPOSED THAT MY OPINION OF ANY ONE COULD HAVE ADMITTED
OF SUCH DIFFERENCE OF CONJECTURE, STEADY AND MATTER OF FACT AS I MAY
CALL MYSELF.  I HAVE REALLY A CURIOSITY TO SEE THE PERSON WHO CAN GIVE
OCCASION TO SUCH DIRECTLY OPPOSITE NOTIONS.  I WISH HE MAY BE INDUCED
TO CALL HERE.  AND WHEN HE DOES, MARY, YOU MAY DEPEND UPON HEARING MY
OPINION; BUT I AM DETERMINED NOT TO JUDGE HIM BEFOREHAND."

"YOU WILL NOT LIKE HIM, I WILL ANSWER FOR IT."

LADY RUSSELL BEGAN TALKING OF SOMETHING ELSE.  MARY SPOKE WITH
ANIMATION OF THEIR MEETING WITH, OR RATHER MISSING, MR ELLIOT SO
EXTRAORDINARILY.

"HE IS A MAN," SAID LADY RUSSELL, "WHOM I HAVE NO WISH TO SEE.  HIS
DECLINING TO BE ON CORDIAL TERMS WITH THE HEAD OF HIS FAMILY, HAS LEFT
A VERY STRONG IMPRESSION IN HIS DISFAVOUR WITH ME."

THIS DECISION CHECKED MARY'S EAGERNESS, AND STOPPED HER SHORT IN THE
MIDST OF THE ELLIOT COUNTENANCE.

WITH REGARD TO CAPTAIN WENTWORTH, THOUGH ANNE HAZARDED NO ENQUIRIES,
THERE WAS VOLUNTARY COMMUNICATION SUFFICIENT.  HIS SPIRITS HAD BEEN
GREATLY RECOVERING LATELY AS MIGHT BE EXPECTED.  AS LOUISA IMPROVED, HE
HAD IMPROVED, AND HE WAS NOW QUITE A DIFFERENT CREATURE FROM WHAT HE
HAD BEEN THE FIRST WEEK.  HE HAD NOT SEEN LOUISA; AND WAS SO EXTREMELY
FEARFUL OF ANY ILL CONSEQUENCE TO HER FROM AN INTERVIEW, THAT HE DID
NOT PRESS FOR IT AT ALL; AND, ON THE CONTRARY, SEEMED TO HAVE A PLAN OF
GOING AWAY FOR A WEEK OR TEN DAYS, TILL HER HEAD WAS STRONGER.  HE HAD
TALKED OF GOING DOWN TO PLYMOUTH FOR A WEEK, AND WANTED TO PERSUADE
CAPTAIN BENWICK TO GO WITH HIM; BUT, AS CHARLES MAINTAINED TO THE LAST,
CAPTAIN BENWICK SEEMED MUCH MORE DISPOSED TO RIDE OVER TO KELLYNCH.

THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT LADY RUSSELL AND ANNE WERE BOTH OCCASIONALLY
THINKING OF CAPTAIN BENWICK, FROM THIS TIME.  LADY RUSSELL COULD NOT
HEAR THE DOOR-BELL WITHOUT FEELING THAT IT MIGHT BE HIS HERALD; NOR
COULD ANNE RETURN FROM ANY STROLL OF SOLITARY INDULGENCE IN HER
FATHER'S GROUNDS, OR ANY VISIT OF CHARITY IN THE VILLAGE, WITHOUT
WONDERING WHETHER SHE MIGHT SEE HIM OR HEAR OF HIM.  CAPTAIN BENWICK
CAME NOT, HOWEVER.  HE WAS EITHER LESS DISPOSED FOR IT THAN CHARLES HAD
IMAGINED, OR HE WAS TOO SHY; AND AFTER GIVING HIM A WEEK'S INDULGENCE,
LADY RUSSELL DETERMINED HIM TO BE UNWORTHY OF THE INTEREST WHICH HE HAD
BEEN BEGINNING TO EXCITE.

THE MUSGROVES CAME BACK TO RECEIVE THEIR HAPPY BOYS AND GIRLS FROM
SCHOOL, BRINGING WITH THEM MRS HARVILLE'S LITTLE CHILDREN, TO IMPROVE
THE NOISE OF UPPERCROSS, AND LESSEN THAT OF LYME.  HENRIETTA REMAINED
WITH LOUISA; BUT ALL THE REST OF THE FAMILY WERE AGAIN IN THEIR USUAL
QUARTERS.

LADY RUSSELL AND ANNE PAID THEIR COMPLIMENTS TO THEM ONCE, WHEN ANNE
COULD NOT BUT FEEL THAT UPPERCROSS WAS ALREADY QUITE ALIVE AGAIN.
THOUGH NEITHER HENRIETTA, NOR LOUISA, NOR CHARLES HAYTER, NOR CAPTAIN
WENTWORTH WERE THERE, THE ROOM PRESENTED AS STRONG A CONTRAST AS COULD
BE WISHED TO THE LAST STATE SHE HAD SEEN IT IN.

IMMEDIATELY SURROUNDING MRS MUSGROVE WERE THE LITTLE HARVILLES, WHOM
SHE WAS SEDULOUSLY GUARDING FROM THE TYRANNY OF THE TWO CHILDREN FROM
THE COTTAGE, EXPRESSLY ARRIVED TO AMUSE THEM.  ON ONE SIDE WAS A TABLE
OCCUPIED BY SOME CHATTERING GIRLS, CUTTING UP SILK AND GOLD PAPER; AND
ON THE OTHER WERE TRESSELS AND TRAYS, BENDING UNDER THE WEIGHT OF BRAWN
AND COLD PIES, WHERE RIOTOUS BOYS WERE HOLDING HIGH REVEL; THE WHOLE
COMPLETED BY A ROARING CHRISTMAS FIRE, WHICH SEEMED DETERMINED TO BE
HEARD, IN SPITE OF ALL THE NOISE OF THE OTHERS.  CHARLES AND MARY ALSO
CAME IN, OF COURSE, DURING THEIR VISIT, AND MR MUSGROVE MADE A POINT OF
PAYING HIS RESPECTS TO LADY RUSSELL, AND SAT DOWN CLOSE TO HER FOR TEN
MINUTES, TALKING WITH A VERY RAISED VOICE, BUT FROM THE CLAMOUR OF THE
CHILDREN ON HIS KNEES, GENERALLY IN VAIN.  IT WAS A FINE FAMILY-PIECE.

ANNE, JUDGING FROM HER OWN TEMPERAMENT, WOULD HAVE DEEMED SUCH A
DOMESTIC HURRICANE A BAD RESTORATIVE OF THE NERVES, WHICH LOUISA'S
ILLNESS MUST HAVE SO GREATLY SHAKEN.  BUT MRS MUSGROVE, WHO GOT ANNE
NEAR HER ON PURPOSE TO THANK HER MOST CORDIALLY, AGAIN AND AGAIN, FOR
ALL HER ATTENTIONS TO THEM, CONCLUDED A SHORT RECAPITULATION OF WHAT
SHE HAD SUFFERED HERSELF BY OBSERVING, WITH A HAPPY GLANCE ROUND THE
ROOM, THAT AFTER ALL SHE HAD GONE THROUGH, NOTHING WAS SO LIKELY TO DO
HER GOOD AS A LITTLE QUIET CHEERFULNESS AT HOME.

LOUISA WAS NOW RECOVERING APACE.  HER MOTHER COULD EVEN THINK OF HER
BEING ABLE TO JOIN THEIR PARTY AT HOME, BEFORE HER BROTHERS AND SISTERS
WENT TO SCHOOL AGAIN.  THE HARVILLES HAD PROMISED TO COME WITH HER AND
STAY AT UPPERCROSS, WHENEVER SHE RETURNED.  CAPTAIN WENTWORTH WAS GONE,
FOR THE PRESENT, TO SEE HIS BROTHER IN SHROPSHIRE.

"I HOPE I SHALL REMEMBER, IN FUTURE," SAID LADY RUSSELL, AS SOON AS
THEY WERE RESEATED IN THE CARRIAGE, "NOT TO CALL AT UPPERCROSS IN THE
CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS."

EVERYBODY HAS THEIR TASTE IN NOISES AS WELL AS IN OTHER MATTERS; AND
SOUNDS ARE QUITE INNOXIOUS, OR MOST DISTRESSING, BY THEIR SORT RATHER
THAN THEIR QUANTITY.  WHEN LADY RUSSELL NOT LONG AFTERWARDS, WAS
ENTERING BATH ON A WET AFTERNOON, AND DRIVING THROUGH THE LONG COURSE
OF STREETS FROM THE OLD BRIDGE TO CAMDEN PLACE, AMIDST THE DASH OF
OTHER CARRIAGES, THE HEAVY RUMBLE OF CARTS AND DRAYS, THE BAWLING OF
NEWSPAPERMEN, MUFFIN-MEN AND MILKMEN, AND THE CEASELESS CLINK OF
PATTENS, SHE MADE NO COMPLAINT.  NO, THESE WERE NOISES WHICH BELONGED
TO THE WINTER PLEASURES; HER SPIRITS ROSE UNDER THEIR INFLUENCE; AND
LIKE MRS MUSGROVE, SHE WAS FEELING, THOUGH NOT SAYING, THAT AFTER BEING
LONG IN THE COUNTRY, NOTHING COULD BE SO GOOD FOR HER AS A LITTLE QUIET
CHEERFULNESS.

ANNE DID NOT SHARE THESE FEELINGS.  SHE PERSISTED IN A VERY DETERMINED,
THOUGH VERY SILENT DISINCLINATION FOR BATH; CAUGHT THE FIRST DIM VIEW
OF THE EXTENSIVE BUILDINGS, SMOKING IN RAIN, WITHOUT ANY WISH OF SEEING
THEM BETTER; FELT THEIR PROGRESS THROUGH THE STREETS TO BE, HOWEVER
DISAGREEABLE, YET TOO RAPID; FOR WHO WOULD BE GLAD TO SEE HER WHEN SHE
ARRIVED?  AND LOOKED BACK, WITH FOND REGRET, TO THE BUSTLES OF
UPPERCROSS AND THE SECLUSION OF KELLYNCH.

ELIZABETH'S LAST LETTER HAD COMMUNICATED A PIECE OF NEWS OF SOME
INTEREST.  MR ELLIOT WAS IN BATH.  HE HAD CALLED IN CAMDEN PLACE; HAD
CALLED A SECOND TIME, A THIRD; HAD BEEN POINTEDLY ATTENTIVE.  IF
ELIZABETH AND HER FATHER DID NOT DECEIVE THEMSELVES, HAD BEEN TAKING
MUCH PAINS TO SEEK THE ACQUAINTANCE, AND PROCLAIM THE VALUE OF THE
CONNECTION, AS HE HAD FORMERLY TAKEN PAINS TO SHEW NEGLECT.  THIS WAS
VERY WONDERFUL IF IT WERE TRUE; AND LADY RUSSELL WAS IN A STATE OF VERY
AGREEABLE CURIOSITY AND PERPLEXITY ABOUT MR ELLIOT, ALREADY RECANTING
THE SENTIMENT SHE HAD SO LATELY EXPRESSED TO MARY, OF HIS BEING "A MAN
WHOM SHE HAD NO WISH TO SEE."  SHE HAD A GREAT WISH TO SEE HIM.  IF HE
REALLY SOUGHT TO RECONCILE HIMSELF LIKE A DUTIFUL BRANCH, HE MUST BE
FORGIVEN FOR HAVING DISMEMBERED HIMSELF FROM THE PATERNAL TREE.

ANNE WAS NOT ANIMATED TO AN EQUAL PITCH BY THE CIRCUMSTANCE, BUT SHE
FELT THAT SHE WOULD RATHER SEE MR ELLIOT AGAIN THAN NOT, WHICH WAS MORE
THAN SHE COULD SAY FOR MANY OTHER PERSONS IN BATH.

SHE WAS PUT DOWN IN CAMDEN PLACE; AND LADY RUSSELL THEN DROVE TO HER
OWN LODGINGS, IN RIVERS STREET.



CHAPTER 15


SIR WALTER HAD TAKEN A VERY GOOD HOUSE IN CAMDEN PLACE, A LOFTY
DIGNIFIED SITUATION, SUCH AS BECOMES A MAN OF CONSEQUENCE; AND BOTH HE
AND ELIZABETH WERE SETTLED THERE, MUCH TO THEIR SATISFACTION.

ANNE ENTERED IT WITH A SINKING HEART, ANTICIPATING AN IMPRISONMENT OF
MANY MONTHS, AND ANXIOUSLY SAYING TO HERSELF, "OH! WHEN SHALL I LEAVE
YOU AGAIN?"  A DEGREE OF UNEXPECTED CORDIALITY, HOWEVER, IN THE WELCOME
SHE RECEIVED, DID HER GOOD.  HER FATHER AND SISTER WERE GLAD TO SEE
HER, FOR THE SAKE OF SHEWING HER THE HOUSE AND FURNITURE, AND MET HER
WITH KINDNESS.  HER MAKING A FOURTH, WHEN THEY SAT DOWN TO DINNER, WAS
NOTICED AS AN ADVANTAGE.

MRS CLAY WAS VERY PLEASANT, AND VERY SMILING, BUT HER COURTESIES AND
SMILES WERE MORE A MATTER OF COURSE.  ANNE HAD ALWAYS FELT THAT SHE
WOULD PRETEND WHAT WAS PROPER ON HER ARRIVAL, BUT THE COMPLAISANCE OF
THE OTHERS WAS UNLOOKED FOR.  THEY WERE EVIDENTLY IN EXCELLENT SPIRITS,
AND SHE WAS SOON TO LISTEN TO THE CAUSES.  THEY HAD NO INCLINATION TO
LISTEN TO HER.  AFTER LAYING OUT FOR SOME COMPLIMENTS OF BEING DEEPLY
REGRETTED IN THEIR OLD NEIGHBOURHOOD, WHICH ANNE COULD NOT PAY, THEY
HAD ONLY A FEW FAINT ENQUIRIES TO MAKE, BEFORE THE TALK MUST BE ALL
THEIR OWN.  UPPERCROSS EXCITED NO INTEREST, KELLYNCH VERY LITTLE: IT
WAS ALL BATH.

THEY HAD THE PLEASURE OF ASSURING HER THAT BATH MORE THAN ANSWERED
THEIR EXPECTATIONS IN EVERY RESPECT.  THEIR HOUSE WAS UNDOUBTEDLY THE
BEST IN CAMDEN PLACE; THEIR DRAWING-ROOMS HAD MANY DECIDED ADVANTAGES
OVER ALL THE OTHERS WHICH THEY HAD EITHER SEEN OR HEARD OF, AND THE
SUPERIORITY WAS NOT LESS IN THE STYLE OF THE FITTING-UP, OR THE TASTE
OF THE FURNITURE.  THEIR ACQUAINTANCE WAS EXCEEDINGLY SOUGHT AFTER.
EVERYBODY WAS WANTING TO VISIT THEM.  THEY HAD DRAWN BACK FROM MANY
INTRODUCTIONS, AND STILL WERE PERPETUALLY HAVING CARDS LEFT BY PEOPLE
OF WHOM THEY KNEW NOTHING.

HERE WERE FUNDS OF ENJOYMENT.  COULD ANNE WONDER THAT HER FATHER AND
SISTER WERE HAPPY?  SHE MIGHT NOT WONDER, BUT SHE MUST SIGH THAT HER
FATHER SHOULD FEEL NO DEGRADATION IN HIS CHANGE, SHOULD SEE NOTHING TO
REGRET IN THE DUTIES AND DIGNITY OF THE RESIDENT LANDHOLDER, SHOULD
FIND SO MUCH TO BE VAIN OF IN THE LITTLENESSES OF A TOWN; AND SHE MUST
SIGH, AND SMILE, AND WONDER TOO, AS ELIZABETH THREW OPEN THE
FOLDING-DOORS AND WALKED WITH EXULTATION FROM ONE DRAWING-ROOM TO THE
OTHER, BOASTING OF THEIR SPACE; AT THE POSSIBILITY OF THAT WOMAN, WHO
HAD BEEN MISTRESS OF KELLYNCH HALL, FINDING EXTENT TO BE PROUD OF
BETWEEN TWO WALLS, PERHAPS THIRTY FEET ASUNDER.

BUT THIS WAS NOT ALL WHICH THEY HAD TO MAKE THEM HAPPY.  THEY HAD MR
ELLIOT TOO.  ANNE HAD A GREAT DEAL TO HEAR OF MR ELLIOT.  HE WAS NOT
ONLY PARDONED, THEY WERE DELIGHTED WITH HIM.  HE HAD BEEN IN BATH ABOUT
A FORTNIGHT; (HE HAD PASSED THROUGH BATH IN NOVEMBER, IN HIS WAY TO
LONDON, WHEN THE INTELLIGENCE OF SIR WALTER'S BEING SETTLED THERE HAD
OF COURSE REACHED HIM, THOUGH ONLY TWENTY-FOUR HOURS IN THE PLACE, BUT
HE HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO AVAIL HIMSELF OF IT;) BUT HE HAD NOW BEEN A
FORTNIGHT IN BATH, AND HIS FIRST OBJECT ON ARRIVING, HAD BEEN TO LEAVE
HIS CARD IN CAMDEN PLACE, FOLLOWING IT UP BY SUCH ASSIDUOUS ENDEAVOURS
TO MEET, AND WHEN THEY DID MEET, BY SUCH GREAT OPENNESS OF CONDUCT,
SUCH READINESS TO APOLOGIZE FOR THE PAST, SUCH SOLICITUDE TO BE
RECEIVED AS A RELATION AGAIN, THAT THEIR FORMER GOOD UNDERSTANDING WAS
COMPLETELY RE-ESTABLISHED.

THEY HAD NOT A FAULT TO FIND IN HIM.  HE HAD EXPLAINED AWAY ALL THE
APPEARANCE OF NEGLECT ON HIS OWN SIDE.  IT HAD ORIGINATED IN
MISAPPREHENSION ENTIRELY.  HE HAD NEVER HAD AN IDEA OF THROWING HIMSELF
OFF; HE HAD FEARED THAT HE WAS THROWN OFF, BUT KNEW NOT WHY, AND
DELICACY HAD KEPT HIM SILENT.  UPON THE HINT OF HAVING SPOKEN
DISRESPECTFULLY OR CARELESSLY OF THE FAMILY AND THE FAMILY HONOURS, HE
WAS QUITE INDIGNANT.  HE, WHO HAD EVER BOASTED OF BEING AN ELLIOT, AND
WHOSE FEELINGS, AS TO CONNECTION, WERE ONLY TOO STRICT TO SUIT THE
UNFEUDAL TONE OF THE PRESENT DAY.  HE WAS ASTONISHED, INDEED, BUT HIS
CHARACTER AND GENERAL CONDUCT MUST REFUTE IT.  HE COULD REFER SIR
WALTER TO ALL WHO KNEW HIM; AND CERTAINLY, THE PAINS HE HAD BEEN TAKING
ON THIS, THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY OF RECONCILIATION, TO BE RESTORED TO THE
FOOTING OF A RELATION AND HEIR-PRESUMPTIVE, WAS A STRONG PROOF OF HIS
OPINIONS ON THE SUBJECT.

THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF HIS MARRIAGE, TOO, WERE FOUND TO ADMIT OF MUCH
EXTENUATION.  THIS WAS AN ARTICLE NOT TO BE ENTERED ON BY HIMSELF; BUT
A VERY INTIMATE FRIEND OF HIS, A COLONEL WALLIS, A HIGHLY RESPECTABLE
MAN, PERFECTLY THE GENTLEMAN, (AND NOT AN ILL-LOOKING MAN, SIR WALTER
ADDED), WHO WAS LIVING IN VERY GOOD STYLE IN MARLBOROUGH BUILDINGS, AND
HAD, AT HIS OWN PARTICULAR REQUEST, BEEN ADMITTED TO THEIR ACQUAINTANCE
THROUGH MR ELLIOT, HAD MENTIONED ONE OR TWO THINGS RELATIVE TO THE
MARRIAGE, WHICH MADE A MATERIAL DIFFERENCE IN THE DISCREDIT OF IT.

COLONEL WALLIS HAD KNOWN MR ELLIOT LONG, HAD BEEN WELL ACQUAINTED ALSO
WITH HIS WIFE, HAD PERFECTLY UNDERSTOOD THE WHOLE STORY.  SHE WAS
CERTAINLY NOT A WOMAN OF FAMILY, BUT WELL EDUCATED, ACCOMPLISHED, RICH,
AND EXCESSIVELY IN LOVE WITH HIS FRIEND.  THERE HAD BEEN THE CHARM.
SHE HAD SOUGHT HIM.  WITHOUT THAT ATTRACTION, NOT ALL HER MONEY WOULD
HAVE TEMPTED ELLIOT, AND SIR WALTER WAS, MOREOVER, ASSURED OF HER
HAVING BEEN A VERY FINE WOMAN.  HERE WAS A GREAT DEAL TO SOFTEN THE
BUSINESS.  A VERY FINE WOMAN WITH A LARGE FORTUNE, IN LOVE WITH HIM!
SIR WALTER SEEMED TO ADMIT IT AS COMPLETE APOLOGY; AND THOUGH ELIZABETH
COULD NOT SEE THE CIRCUMSTANCE IN QUITE SO FAVOURABLE A LIGHT, SHE
ALLOWED IT BE A GREAT EXTENUATION.

MR ELLIOT HAD CALLED REPEATEDLY, HAD DINED WITH THEM ONCE, EVIDENTLY
DELIGHTED BY THE DISTINCTION OF BEING ASKED, FOR THEY GAVE NO DINNERS
IN GENERAL; DELIGHTED, IN SHORT, BY EVERY PROOF OF COUSINLY NOTICE, AND
PLACING HIS WHOLE HAPPINESS IN BEING ON INTIMATE TERMS IN CAMDEN PLACE.

ANNE LISTENED, BUT WITHOUT QUITE UNDERSTANDING IT.  ALLOWANCES, LARGE
ALLOWANCES, SHE KNEW, MUST BE MADE FOR THE IDEAS OF THOSE WHO SPOKE.
SHE HEARD IT ALL UNDER EMBELLISHMENT.  ALL THAT SOUNDED EXTRAVAGANT OR
IRRATIONAL IN THE PROGRESS OF THE RECONCILIATION MIGHT HAVE NO ORIGIN
BUT IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE RELATORS.  STILL, HOWEVER, SHE HAD THE
SENSATION OF THERE BEING SOMETHING MORE THAN IMMEDIATELY APPEARED, IN
MR ELLIOT'S WISHING, AFTER AN INTERVAL OF SO MANY YEARS, TO BE WELL
RECEIVED BY THEM.  IN A WORLDLY VIEW, HE HAD NOTHING TO GAIN BY BEING
ON TERMS WITH SIR WALTER; NOTHING TO RISK BY A STATE OF VARIANCE.  IN
ALL PROBABILITY HE WAS ALREADY THE RICHER OF THE TWO, AND THE KELLYNCH
ESTATE WOULD AS SURELY BE HIS HEREAFTER AS THE TITLE.  A SENSIBLE MAN,
AND HE HAD LOOKED LIKE A VERY SENSIBLE MAN, WHY SHOULD IT BE AN OBJECT
TO HIM?  SHE COULD ONLY OFFER ONE SOLUTION; IT WAS, PERHAPS, FOR
ELIZABETH'S SAKE.  THERE MIGHT REALLY HAVE BEEN A LIKING FORMERLY,
THOUGH CONVENIENCE AND ACCIDENT HAD DRAWN HIM A DIFFERENT WAY; AND NOW
THAT HE COULD AFFORD TO PLEASE HIMSELF, HE MIGHT MEAN TO PAY HIS
ADDRESSES TO HER.  ELIZABETH WAS CERTAINLY VERY HANDSOME, WITH
WELL-BRED, ELEGANT MANNERS, AND HER CHARACTER MIGHT NEVER HAVE BEEN
PENETRATED BY MR ELLIOT, KNOWING HER BUT IN PUBLIC, AND WHEN VERY YOUNG
HIMSELF.  HOW HER TEMPER AND UNDERSTANDING MIGHT BEAR THE INVESTIGATION
OF HIS PRESENT KEENER TIME OF LIFE WAS ANOTHER CONCERN AND RATHER A
FEARFUL ONE.  MOST EARNESTLY DID SHE WISH THAT HE MIGHT NOT BE TOO
NICE, OR TOO OBSERVANT IF ELIZABETH WERE HIS OBJECT; AND THAT ELIZABETH
WAS DISPOSED TO BELIEVE HERSELF SO, AND THAT HER FRIEND MRS CLAY WAS
ENCOURAGING THE IDEA, SEEMED APPARENT BY A GLANCE OR TWO BETWEEN THEM,
WHILE MR ELLIOT'S FREQUENT VISITS WERE TALKED OF.

ANNE MENTIONED THE GLIMPSES SHE HAD HAD OF HIM AT LYME, BUT WITHOUT
BEING MUCH ATTENDED TO.  "OH! YES, PERHAPS, IT HAD BEEN MR ELLIOT.
THEY DID NOT KNOW.  IT MIGHT BE HIM, PERHAPS."  THEY COULD NOT LISTEN
TO HER DESCRIPTION OF HIM.  THEY WERE DESCRIBING HIM THEMSELVES; SIR
WALTER ESPECIALLY.  HE DID JUSTICE TO HIS VERY GENTLEMANLIKE
APPEARANCE, HIS AIR OF ELEGANCE AND FASHION, HIS GOOD SHAPED FACE, HIS
SENSIBLE EYE; BUT, AT THE SAME TIME, "MUST LAMENT HIS BEING VERY MUCH
UNDER-HUNG, A DEFECT WHICH TIME SEEMED TO HAVE INCREASED; NOR COULD HE
PRETEND TO SAY THAT TEN YEARS HAD NOT ALTERED ALMOST EVERY FEATURE FOR
THE WORSE.  MR ELLIOT APPEARED TO THINK THAT HE (SIR WALTER) WAS
LOOKING EXACTLY AS HE HAD DONE WHEN THEY LAST PARTED;" BUT SIR WALTER
HAD "NOT BEEN ABLE TO RETURN THE COMPLIMENT ENTIRELY, WHICH HAD
EMBARRASSED HIM.  HE DID NOT MEAN TO COMPLAIN, HOWEVER.  MR ELLIOT WAS
BETTER TO LOOK AT THAN MOST MEN, AND HE HAD NO OBJECTION TO BEING SEEN
WITH HIM ANYWHERE."

MR ELLIOT, AND HIS FRIENDS IN MARLBOROUGH BUILDINGS, WERE TALKED OF THE
WHOLE EVENING.  "COLONEL WALLIS HAD BEEN SO IMPATIENT TO BE INTRODUCED
TO THEM! AND MR ELLIOT SO ANXIOUS THAT HE SHOULD!" AND THERE WAS A MRS
WALLIS, AT PRESENT KNOWN ONLY TO THEM BY DESCRIPTION, AS SHE WAS IN
DAILY EXPECTATION OF HER CONFINEMENT; BUT MR ELLIOT SPOKE OF HER AS "A
MOST CHARMING WOMAN, QUITE WORTHY OF BEING KNOWN IN CAMDEN PLACE," AND
AS SOON AS SHE RECOVERED THEY WERE TO BE ACQUAINTED.  SIR WALTER
THOUGHT MUCH OF MRS WALLIS; SHE WAS SAID TO BE AN EXCESSIVELY PRETTY
WOMAN, BEAUTIFUL.  "HE LONGED TO SEE HER.  HE HOPED SHE MIGHT MAKE SOME
AMENDS FOR THE MANY VERY PLAIN FACES HE WAS CONTINUALLY PASSING IN THE
STREETS.  THE WORST OF BATH WAS THE NUMBER OF ITS PLAIN WOMEN.  HE DID
NOT MEAN TO SAY THAT THERE WERE NO PRETTY WOMEN, BUT THE NUMBER OF THE
PLAIN WAS OUT OF ALL PROPORTION.  HE HAD FREQUENTLY OBSERVED, AS HE
WALKED, THAT ONE HANDSOME FACE WOULD BE FOLLOWED BY THIRTY, OR
FIVE-AND-THIRTY FRIGHTS; AND ONCE, AS HE HAD STOOD IN A SHOP ON BOND
STREET, HE HAD COUNTED EIGHTY-SEVEN WOMEN GO BY, ONE AFTER ANOTHER,
WITHOUT THERE BEING A TOLERABLE FACE AMONG THEM.  IT HAD BEEN A FROSTY
MORNING, TO BE SURE, A SHARP FROST, WHICH HARDLY ONE WOMAN IN A
THOUSAND COULD STAND THE TEST OF.  BUT STILL, THERE CERTAINLY WERE A
DREADFUL MULTITUDE OF UGLY WOMEN IN BATH; AND AS FOR THE MEN!  THEY
WERE INFINITELY WORSE.  SUCH SCARECROWS AS THE STREETS WERE FULL OF!
IT WAS EVIDENT HOW LITTLE THE WOMEN WERE USED TO THE SIGHT OF ANYTHING
TOLERABLE, BY THE EFFECT WHICH A MAN OF DECENT APPEARANCE PRODUCED.  HE
HAD NEVER WALKED ANYWHERE ARM-IN-ARM WITH COLONEL WALLIS (WHO WAS A
FINE MILITARY FIGURE, THOUGH SANDY-HAIRED) WITHOUT OBSERVING THAT EVERY
WOMAN'S EYE WAS UPON HIM; EVERY WOMAN'S EYE WAS SURE TO BE UPON COLONEL
WALLIS."  MODEST SIR WALTER!  HE WAS NOT ALLOWED TO ESCAPE, HOWEVER.
HIS DAUGHTER AND MRS CLAY UNITED IN HINTING THAT COLONEL WALLIS'S
COMPANION MIGHT HAVE AS GOOD A FIGURE AS COLONEL WALLIS, AND CERTAINLY
WAS NOT SANDY-HAIRED.

"HOW IS MARY LOOKING?" SAID SIR WALTER, IN THE HEIGHT OF HIS GOOD
HUMOUR.  "THE LAST TIME I SAW HER SHE HAD A RED NOSE, BUT I HOPE THAT
MAY NOT HAPPEN EVERY DAY."

"OH! NO, THAT MUST HAVE BEEN QUITE ACCIDENTAL.  IN GENERAL SHE HAS BEEN
IN VERY GOOD HEALTH AND VERY GOOD LOOKS SINCE MICHAELMAS."

"IF I THOUGHT IT WOULD NOT TEMPT HER TO GO OUT IN SHARP WINDS, AND GROW
COARSE, I WOULD SEND HER A NEW HAT AND PELISSE."

ANNE WAS CONSIDERING WHETHER SHE SHOULD VENTURE TO SUGGEST THAT A GOWN,
OR A CAP, WOULD NOT BE LIABLE TO ANY SUCH MISUSE, WHEN A KNOCK AT THE
DOOR SUSPENDED EVERYTHING.  "A KNOCK AT THE DOOR! AND SO LATE!  IT WAS
TEN O'CLOCK.  COULD IT BE MR ELLIOT?  THEY KNEW HE WAS TO DINE IN
LANSDOWN CRESCENT.  IT WAS POSSIBLE THAT HE MIGHT STOP IN HIS WAY HOME
TO ASK THEM HOW THEY DID.  THEY COULD THINK OF NO ONE ELSE.  MRS CLAY
DECIDEDLY THOUGHT IT MR ELLIOT'S KNOCK."  MRS CLAY WAS RIGHT.  WITH ALL
THE STATE WHICH A BUTLER AND FOOT-BOY COULD GIVE, MR ELLIOT WAS USHERED
INTO THE ROOM.

IT WAS THE SAME, THE VERY SAME MAN, WITH NO DIFFERENCE BUT OF DRESS.
ANNE DREW A LITTLE BACK, WHILE THE OTHERS RECEIVED HIS COMPLIMENTS, AND
HER SISTER HIS APOLOGIES FOR CALLING AT SO UNUSUAL AN HOUR, BUT "HE
COULD NOT BE SO NEAR WITHOUT WISHING TO KNOW THAT NEITHER SHE NOR HER
FRIEND HAD TAKEN COLD THE DAY BEFORE," ETC. ETC; WHICH WAS ALL AS
POLITELY DONE, AND AS POLITELY TAKEN, AS POSSIBLE, BUT HER PART MUST
FOLLOW THEN.  SIR WALTER TALKED OF HIS YOUNGEST DAUGHTER; "MR ELLIOT
MUST GIVE HIM LEAVE TO PRESENT HIM TO HIS YOUNGEST DAUGHTER" (THERE WAS
NO OCCASION FOR REMEMBERING MARY); AND ANNE, SMILING AND BLUSHING, VERY
BECOMINGLY SHEWED TO MR ELLIOT THE PRETTY FEATURES WHICH HE HAD BY NO
MEANS FORGOTTEN, AND INSTANTLY SAW, WITH AMUSEMENT AT HIS LITTLE START
OF SURPRISE, THAT HE HAD NOT BEEN AT ALL AWARE OF WHO SHE WAS.  HE
LOOKED COMPLETELY ASTONISHED, BUT NOT MORE ASTONISHED THAN PLEASED; HIS
EYES BRIGHTENED! AND WITH THE MOST PERFECT ALACRITY HE WELCOMED THE
RELATIONSHIP, ALLUDED TO THE PAST, AND ENTREATED TO BE RECEIVED AS AN
ACQUAINTANCE ALREADY.  HE WAS QUITE AS GOOD-LOOKING AS HE HAD APPEARED
AT LYME, HIS COUNTENANCE IMPROVED BY SPEAKING, AND HIS MANNERS WERE SO
EXACTLY WHAT THEY OUGHT TO BE, SO POLISHED, SO EASY, SO PARTICULARLY
AGREEABLE, THAT SHE COULD COMPARE THEM IN EXCELLENCE TO ONLY ONE
PERSON'S MANNERS.  THEY WERE NOT THE SAME, BUT THEY WERE, PERHAPS,
EQUALLY GOOD.

HE SAT DOWN WITH THEM, AND IMPROVED THEIR CONVERSATION VERY MUCH.
THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT OF HIS BEING A SENSIBLE MAN.  TEN MINUTES WERE
ENOUGH TO CERTIFY THAT.  HIS TONE, HIS EXPRESSIONS, HIS CHOICE OF
SUBJECT, HIS KNOWING WHERE TO STOP; IT WAS ALL THE OPERATION OF A
SENSIBLE, DISCERNING MIND.  AS SOON AS HE COULD, HE BEGAN TO TALK TO
HER OF LYME, WANTING TO COMPARE OPINIONS RESPECTING THE PLACE, BUT
ESPECIALLY WANTING TO SPEAK OF THE CIRCUMSTANCE OF THEIR HAPPENING TO
BE GUESTS IN THE SAME INN AT THE SAME TIME; TO GIVE HIS OWN ROUTE,
UNDERSTAND SOMETHING OF HERS, AND REGRET THAT HE SHOULD HAVE LOST SUCH
AN OPPORTUNITY OF PAYING HIS RESPECTS TO HER.  SHE GAVE HIM A SHORT
ACCOUNT OF HER PARTY AND BUSINESS AT LYME.  HIS REGRET INCREASED AS HE
LISTENED.  HE HAD SPENT HIS WHOLE SOLITARY EVENING IN THE ROOM
ADJOINING THEIRS; HAD HEARD VOICES, MIRTH CONTINUALLY; THOUGHT THEY
MUST BE A MOST DELIGHTFUL SET OF PEOPLE, LONGED TO BE WITH THEM, BUT
CERTAINLY WITHOUT THE SMALLEST SUSPICION OF HIS POSSESSING THE SHADOW
OF A RIGHT TO INTRODUCE HIMSELF.  IF HE HAD BUT ASKED WHO THE PARTY
WERE!  THE NAME OF MUSGROVE WOULD HAVE TOLD HIM ENOUGH.  "WELL, IT
WOULD SERVE TO CURE HIM OF AN ABSURD PRACTICE OF NEVER ASKING A
QUESTION AT AN INN, WHICH HE HAD ADOPTED, WHEN QUITE A YOUNG MAN, ON
THE PRINCIPAL OF ITS BEING VERY UNGENTEEL TO BE CURIOUS.

"THE NOTIONS OF A YOUNG MAN OF ONE OR TWO AND TWENTY," SAID HE, "AS TO
WHAT IS NECESSARY IN MANNERS TO MAKE HIM QUITE THE THING, ARE MORE
ABSURD, I BELIEVE, THAN THOSE OF ANY OTHER SET OF BEINGS IN THE WORLD.
THE FOLLY OF THE MEANS THEY OFTEN EMPLOY IS ONLY TO BE EQUALLED BY THE
FOLLY OF WHAT THEY HAVE IN VIEW."

BUT HE MUST NOT BE ADDRESSING HIS REFLECTIONS TO ANNE ALONE: HE KNEW
IT; HE WAS SOON DIFFUSED AGAIN AMONG THE OTHERS, AND IT WAS ONLY AT
INTERVALS THAT HE COULD RETURN TO LYME.

HIS ENQUIRIES, HOWEVER, PRODUCED AT LENGTH AN ACCOUNT OF THE SCENE SHE
HAD BEEN ENGAGED IN THERE, SOON AFTER HIS LEAVING THE PLACE.  HAVING
ALLUDED TO "AN ACCIDENT,"  HE MUST HEAR THE WHOLE.  WHEN HE QUESTIONED,
SIR WALTER AND ELIZABETH BEGAN TO QUESTION ALSO, BUT THE DIFFERENCE IN
THEIR MANNER OF DOING IT COULD NOT BE UNFELT.  SHE COULD ONLY COMPARE
MR ELLIOT TO LADY RUSSELL, IN THE WISH OF REALLY COMPREHENDING WHAT HAD
PASSED, AND IN THE DEGREE OF CONCERN FOR WHAT SHE MUST HAVE SUFFERED IN
WITNESSING IT.

HE STAID AN HOUR WITH THEM.  THE ELEGANT LITTLE CLOCK ON THE MANTEL-PIECE
HAD STRUCK "ELEVEN WITH ITS SILVER SOUNDS," AND THE WATCHMAN WAS
BEGINNING TO BE HEARD AT A DISTANCE TELLING THE SAME TALE, BEFORE MR
ELLIOT OR ANY OF THEM SEEMED TO FEEL THAT HE HAD BEEN THERE LONG.

ANNE COULD NOT HAVE SUPPOSED IT POSSIBLE THAT HER FIRST EVENING IN
CAMDEN PLACE COULD HAVE PASSED SO WELL!



CHAPTER 16


THERE WAS ONE POINT WHICH ANNE, ON RETURNING TO HER FAMILY, WOULD HAVE
BEEN MORE THANKFUL TO ASCERTAIN EVEN THAN MR ELLIOT'S BEING IN LOVE
WITH ELIZABETH, WHICH WAS, HER FATHER'S NOT BEING IN LOVE WITH MRS
CLAY; AND SHE WAS VERY FAR FROM EASY ABOUT IT, WHEN SHE HAD BEEN AT
HOME A FEW HOURS.  ON GOING DOWN TO BREAKFAST THE NEXT MORNING, SHE
FOUND THERE HAD JUST BEEN A DECENT PRETENCE ON THE LADY'S SIDE OF
MEANING TO LEAVE THEM.  SHE COULD IMAGINE MRS CLAY TO HAVE SAID, THAT
"NOW MISS ANNE WAS COME, SHE COULD NOT SUPPOSE HERSELF AT ALL WANTED;"
FOR ELIZABETH WAS REPLYING IN A SORT OF WHISPER, "THAT MUST NOT BE ANY
REASON, INDEED.  I ASSURE YOU I FEEL IT NONE.  SHE IS NOTHING TO ME,
COMPARED WITH YOU;"  AND SHE WAS IN FULL TIME TO HEAR HER FATHER SAY,
"MY DEAR MADAM, THIS MUST NOT BE.  AS YET, YOU HAVE SEEN NOTHING OF
BATH.  YOU HAVE BEEN HERE ONLY TO BE USEFUL.  YOU MUST NOT RUN AWAY
FROM US NOW.  YOU MUST STAY TO BE ACQUAINTED WITH MRS WALLIS, THE
BEAUTIFUL MRS WALLIS.  TO YOUR FINE MIND, I WELL KNOW THE SIGHT OF
BEAUTY IS A REAL GRATIFICATION."

HE SPOKE AND LOOKED SO MUCH IN EARNEST, THAT ANNE WAS NOT SURPRISED TO
SEE MRS CLAY STEALING A GLANCE AT ELIZABETH AND HERSELF.  HER
COUNTENANCE, PERHAPS, MIGHT EXPRESS SOME WATCHFULNESS; BUT THE PRAISE
OF THE FINE MIND DID NOT APPEAR TO EXCITE A THOUGHT IN HER SISTER.  THE
LADY COULD NOT BUT YIELD TO SUCH JOINT ENTREATIES, AND PROMISE TO STAY.

IN THE COURSE OF THE SAME MORNING, ANNE AND HER FATHER CHANCING TO BE
ALONE TOGETHER, HE BEGAN TO COMPLIMENT HER ON HER IMPROVED LOOKS; HE
THOUGHT HER "LESS THIN IN HER PERSON, IN HER CHEEKS; HER SKIN, HER
COMPLEXION, GREATLY IMPROVED; CLEARER, FRESHER.  HAD SHE BEEN USING ANY
THING IN PARTICULAR?"  "NO, NOTHING."  "MERELY GOWLAND," HE SUPPOSED.
"NO, NOTHING AT ALL."  "HA! HE WAS SURPRISED AT THAT;" AND ADDED,
"CERTAINLY YOU CANNOT DO BETTER THAN TO CONTINUE AS YOU ARE; YOU CANNOT
BE BETTER THAN WELL; OR I SHOULD RECOMMEND GOWLAND, THE CONSTANT USE OF
GOWLAND, DURING THE SPRING MONTHS.  MRS CLAY HAS BEEN USING IT AT MY
RECOMMENDATION, AND YOU SEE WHAT IT HAS DONE FOR HER.  YOU SEE HOW IT
HAS CARRIED AWAY HER FRECKLES."

IF ELIZABETH COULD BUT HAVE HEARD THIS!  SUCH PERSONAL PRAISE MIGHT
HAVE STRUCK HER, ESPECIALLY AS IT DID NOT APPEAR TO ANNE THAT THE
FRECKLES WERE AT ALL LESSENED.  BUT EVERYTHING MUST TAKE ITS CHANCE.
THE EVIL OF A MARRIAGE WOULD BE MUCH DIMINISHED, IF ELIZABETH WERE ALSO
TO MARRY.  AS FOR HERSELF, SHE MIGHT ALWAYS COMMAND A HOME WITH LADY
RUSSELL.

LADY RUSSELL'S COMPOSED MIND AND POLITE MANNERS WERE PUT TO SOME TRIAL
ON THIS POINT, IN HER INTERCOURSE IN CAMDEN PLACE.  THE SIGHT OF MRS
CLAY IN SUCH FAVOUR, AND OF ANNE SO OVERLOOKED, WAS A PERPETUAL
PROVOCATION TO HER THERE; AND VEXED HER AS MUCH WHEN SHE WAS AWAY, AS A
PERSON IN BATH WHO DRINKS THE WATER, GETS ALL THE NEW PUBLICATIONS, AND
HAS A VERY LARGE ACQUAINTANCE, HAS TIME TO BE VEXED.

AS MR ELLIOT BECAME KNOWN TO HER, SHE GREW MORE CHARITABLE, OR MORE
INDIFFERENT, TOWARDS THE OTHERS.  HIS MANNERS WERE AN IMMEDIATE
RECOMMENDATION; AND ON CONVERSING WITH HIM SHE FOUND THE SOLID SO FULLY
SUPPORTING THE SUPERFICIAL, THAT SHE WAS AT FIRST, AS SHE TOLD ANNE,
ALMOST READY TO EXCLAIM, "CAN THIS BE MR ELLIOT?" AND COULD NOT
SERIOUSLY PICTURE TO HERSELF A MORE AGREEABLE OR ESTIMABLE MAN.
EVERYTHING UNITED IN HIM; GOOD UNDERSTANDING, CORRECT OPINIONS,
KNOWLEDGE OF THE WORLD, AND A WARM HEART.  HE HAD STRONG FEELINGS OF
FAMILY ATTACHMENT AND FAMILY HONOUR, WITHOUT PRIDE OR WEAKNESS; HE
LIVED WITH THE LIBERALITY OF A MAN OF FORTUNE, WITHOUT DISPLAY; HE
JUDGED FOR HIMSELF IN EVERYTHING ESSENTIAL, WITHOUT DEFYING PUBLIC
OPINION IN ANY POINT OF WORLDLY DECORUM.  HE WAS STEADY, OBSERVANT,
MODERATE, CANDID; NEVER RUN AWAY WITH BY SPIRITS OR BY SELFISHNESS,
WHICH FANCIED ITSELF STRONG FEELING; AND YET, WITH A SENSIBILITY TO
WHAT WAS AMIABLE AND LOVELY, AND A VALUE FOR ALL THE FELICITIES OF
DOMESTIC LIFE, WHICH CHARACTERS OF FANCIED ENTHUSIASM AND VIOLENT
AGITATION SELDOM REALLY POSSESS.  SHE WAS SURE THAT HE HAD NOT BEEN
HAPPY IN MARRIAGE.  COLONEL WALLIS SAID IT, AND LADY RUSSELL SAW IT;
BUT IT HAD BEEN NO UNHAPPINESS TO SOUR HIS MIND, NOR (SHE BEGAN PRETTY
SOON TO SUSPECT) TO PREVENT HIS THINKING OF A SECOND CHOICE.  HER
SATISFACTION IN MR ELLIOT OUTWEIGHED ALL THE PLAGUE OF MRS CLAY.

IT WAS NOW SOME YEARS SINCE ANNE HAD BEGUN TO LEARN THAT SHE AND HER
EXCELLENT FRIEND COULD SOMETIMES THINK DIFFERENTLY; AND IT DID NOT
SURPRISE HER, THEREFORE, THAT LADY RUSSELL SHOULD SEE NOTHING
SUSPICIOUS OR INCONSISTENT, NOTHING TO REQUIRE MORE MOTIVES THAN
APPEARED, IN MR ELLIOT'S GREAT DESIRE OF A RECONCILIATION.  IN LADY
RUSSELL'S VIEW, IT WAS PERFECTLY NATURAL THAT MR ELLIOT, AT A MATURE
TIME OF LIFE, SHOULD FEEL IT A MOST DESIRABLE OBJECT, AND WHAT WOULD
VERY GENERALLY RECOMMEND HIM AMONG ALL SENSIBLE PEOPLE, TO BE ON GOOD
TERMS WITH THE HEAD OF HIS FAMILY; THE SIMPLEST PROCESS IN THE WORLD OF
TIME UPON A HEAD NATURALLY CLEAR, AND ONLY ERRING IN THE HEYDAY OF
YOUTH.  ANNE PRESUMED, HOWEVER, STILL TO SMILE ABOUT IT, AND AT LAST TO
MENTION "ELIZABETH."  LADY RUSSELL LISTENED, AND LOOKED, AND MADE ONLY
THIS CAUTIOUS REPLY:--"ELIZABETH! VERY WELL; TIME WILL EXPLAIN."

IT WAS A REFERENCE TO THE FUTURE, WHICH ANNE, AFTER A LITTLE
OBSERVATION, FELT SHE MUST SUBMIT TO.  SHE COULD DETERMINE NOTHING AT
PRESENT.  IN THAT HOUSE ELIZABETH MUST BE FIRST; AND SHE WAS IN THE
HABIT OF SUCH GENERAL OBSERVANCE AS "MISS ELLIOT," THAT ANY
PARTICULARITY OF ATTENTION SEEMED ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE.  MR ELLIOT, TOO,
IT MUST BE REMEMBERED, HAD NOT BEEN A WIDOWER SEVEN MONTHS.  A LITTLE
DELAY ON HIS SIDE MIGHT BE VERY EXCUSABLE.  IN FACT, ANNE COULD NEVER
SEE THE CRAPE ROUND HIS HAT, WITHOUT FEARING THAT SHE WAS THE
INEXCUSABLE ONE, IN ATTRIBUTING TO HIM SUCH IMAGINATIONS; FOR THOUGH
HIS MARRIAGE HAD NOT BEEN VERY HAPPY, STILL IT HAD EXISTED SO MANY
YEARS THAT SHE COULD NOT COMPREHEND A VERY RAPID RECOVERY FROM THE
AWFUL IMPRESSION OF ITS BEING DISSOLVED.

HOWEVER IT MIGHT END, HE WAS WITHOUT ANY QUESTION THEIR PLEASANTEST
ACQUAINTANCE IN BATH:  SHE SAW NOBODY EQUAL TO HIM; AND IT WAS A GREAT
INDULGENCE NOW AND THEN TO TALK TO HIM ABOUT LYME, WHICH HE SEEMED TO
HAVE AS LIVELY A WISH TO SEE AGAIN, AND TO SEE MORE OF, AS HERSELF.
THEY WENT THROUGH THE PARTICULARS OF THEIR FIRST MEETING A GREAT MANY
TIMES.  HE GAVE HER TO UNDERSTAND THAT HE HAD LOOKED AT HER WITH SOME
EARNESTNESS.  SHE KNEW IT WELL; AND SHE REMEMBERED ANOTHER PERSON'S
LOOK ALSO.

THEY DID NOT ALWAYS THINK ALIKE.  HIS VALUE FOR RANK AND CONNEXION SHE
PERCEIVED WAS GREATER THAN HERS.  IT WAS NOT MERELY COMPLAISANCE, IT
MUST BE A LIKING TO THE CAUSE, WHICH MADE HIM ENTER WARMLY INTO HER
FATHER AND SISTER'S SOLICITUDES ON A SUBJECT WHICH SHE THOUGHT UNWORTHY
TO EXCITE THEM.  THE BATH PAPER ONE MORNING ANNOUNCED THE ARRIVAL OF
THE DOWAGER VISCOUNTESS DALRYMPLE, AND HER DAUGHTER, THE HONOURABLE
MISS CARTERET; AND ALL THE COMFORT OF NO. --, CAMDEN PLACE, WAS SWEPT
AWAY FOR MANY DAYS; FOR THE DALRYMPLES (IN ANNE'S OPINION, MOST
UNFORTUNATELY) WERE COUSINS OF THE ELLIOTS; AND THE AGONY WAS HOW TO
INTRODUCE THEMSELVES PROPERLY.

ANNE HAD NEVER SEEN HER FATHER AND SISTER BEFORE IN CONTACT WITH
NOBILITY, AND SHE MUST ACKNOWLEDGE HERSELF DISAPPOINTED.  SHE HAD HOPED
BETTER THINGS FROM THEIR HIGH IDEAS OF THEIR OWN SITUATION IN LIFE, AND
WAS REDUCED TO FORM A WISH WHICH SHE HAD NEVER FORESEEN; A WISH THAT
THEY HAD MORE PRIDE; FOR "OUR COUSINS LADY DALRYMPLE AND MISS
CARTERET;" "OUR COUSINS, THE DALRYMPLES," SOUNDED IN HER EARS ALL DAY
LONG.

SIR WALTER HAD ONCE BEEN IN COMPANY WITH THE LATE VISCOUNT, BUT HAD
NEVER SEEN ANY OF THE REST OF THE FAMILY; AND THE DIFFICULTIES OF THE
CASE AROSE FROM THERE HAVING BEEN A SUSPENSION OF ALL INTERCOURSE BY
LETTERS OF CEREMONY, EVER SINCE THE DEATH OF THAT SAID LATE VISCOUNT,
WHEN, IN CONSEQUENCE OF A DANGEROUS ILLNESS OF SIR WALTER'S AT THE SAME
TIME, THERE HAD BEEN AN UNLUCKY OMISSION AT KELLYNCH.  NO LETTER OF
CONDOLENCE HAD BEEN SENT TO IRELAND.  THE NEGLECT HAD BEEN VISITED ON
THE HEAD OF THE SINNER; FOR WHEN POOR LADY ELLIOT DIED HERSELF, NO
LETTER OF CONDOLENCE WAS RECEIVED AT KELLYNCH, AND, CONSEQUENTLY, THERE
WAS BUT TOO MUCH REASON TO APPREHEND THAT THE DALRYMPLES CONSIDERED THE
RELATIONSHIP AS CLOSED.  HOW TO HAVE THIS ANXIOUS BUSINESS SET TO
RIGHTS, AND BE ADMITTED AS COUSINS AGAIN, WAS THE QUESTION:  AND IT WAS
A QUESTION WHICH, IN A MORE RATIONAL MANNER, NEITHER LADY RUSSELL NOR
MR ELLIOT THOUGHT UNIMPORTANT.  "FAMILY CONNEXIONS WERE ALWAYS WORTH
PRESERVING, GOOD COMPANY ALWAYS WORTH SEEKING; LADY DALRYMPLE HAD TAKEN
A HOUSE, FOR THREE MONTHS, IN LAURA PLACE, AND WOULD BE LIVING IN
STYLE.  SHE HAD BEEN AT BATH THE YEAR BEFORE, AND LADY RUSSELL HAD
HEARD HER SPOKEN OF AS A CHARMING WOMAN.  IT WAS VERY DESIRABLE THAT
THE CONNEXION SHOULD BE RENEWED, IF IT COULD BE DONE, WITHOUT ANY
COMPROMISE OF PROPRIETY ON THE SIDE OF THE ELLIOTS."

SIR WALTER, HOWEVER, WOULD CHOOSE HIS OWN MEANS, AND AT LAST WROTE A
VERY FINE LETTER OF AMPLE EXPLANATION, REGRET, AND ENTREATY, TO HIS
RIGHT HONOURABLE COUSIN.  NEITHER LADY RUSSELL NOR MR ELLIOT COULD
ADMIRE THE LETTER; BUT IT DID ALL THAT WAS WANTED, IN BRINGING THREE
LINES OF SCRAWL FROM THE DOWAGER VISCOUNTESS.  "SHE WAS VERY MUCH
HONOURED, AND SHOULD BE HAPPY IN THEIR ACQUAINTANCE." THE TOILS OF THE
BUSINESS WERE OVER, THE SWEETS BEGAN.  THEY VISITED IN LAURA PLACE,
THEY HAD THE CARDS OF DOWAGER VISCOUNTESS DALRYMPLE, AND THE HONOURABLE
MISS CARTERET, TO BE ARRANGED WHEREVER THEY MIGHT BE MOST VISIBLE:  AND
"OUR COUSINS IN LAURA PLACE,"--"OUR COUSIN, LADY DALRYMPLE AND MISS
CARTERET," WERE TALKED OF TO EVERYBODY.

ANNE WAS ASHAMED.  HAD LADY DALRYMPLE AND HER DAUGHTER EVEN BEEN VERY
AGREEABLE, SHE WOULD STILL HAVE BEEN ASHAMED OF THE AGITATION THEY
CREATED, BUT THEY WERE NOTHING.  THERE WAS NO SUPERIORITY OF MANNER,
ACCOMPLISHMENT, OR UNDERSTANDING.  LADY DALRYMPLE HAD ACQUIRED THE NAME
OF "A CHARMING WOMAN," BECAUSE SHE HAD A SMILE AND A CIVIL ANSWER FOR
EVERYBODY.  MISS CARTERET, WITH STILL LESS TO SAY, WAS SO PLAIN AND SO
AWKWARD, THAT SHE WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN TOLERATED IN CAMDEN PLACE BUT
FOR HER BIRTH.

LADY RUSSELL CONFESSED SHE HAD EXPECTED SOMETHING BETTER; BUT YET "IT
WAS AN ACQUAINTANCE WORTH HAVING;" AND WHEN ANNE VENTURED TO SPEAK HER
OPINION OF THEM TO MR ELLIOT, HE AGREED TO THEIR BEING NOTHING IN
THEMSELVES, BUT STILL MAINTAINED THAT, AS A FAMILY CONNEXION, AS GOOD
COMPANY, AS THOSE WHO WOULD COLLECT GOOD COMPANY AROUND THEM, THEY HAD
THEIR VALUE.  ANNE SMILED AND SAID,

"MY IDEA OF GOOD COMPANY, MR ELLIOT, IS THE COMPANY OF CLEVER,
WELL-INFORMED PEOPLE, WHO HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF CONVERSATION; THAT IS
WHAT I CALL GOOD COMPANY."

"YOU ARE MISTAKEN," SAID HE GENTLY, "THAT IS NOT GOOD COMPANY; THAT IS
THE BEST.  GOOD COMPANY REQUIRES ONLY BIRTH, EDUCATION, AND MANNERS,
AND WITH REGARD TO EDUCATION IS NOT VERY NICE.  BIRTH AND GOOD MANNERS
ARE ESSENTIAL; BUT A LITTLE LEARNING IS BY NO MEANS A DANGEROUS THING
IN GOOD COMPANY; ON THE CONTRARY, IT WILL DO VERY WELL.  MY COUSIN ANNE
SHAKES HER HEAD.  SHE IS NOT SATISFIED.  SHE IS FASTIDIOUS.  MY DEAR
COUSIN" (SITTING DOWN BY HER), "YOU HAVE A BETTER RIGHT TO BE
FASTIDIOUS THAN ALMOST ANY OTHER WOMAN I KNOW; BUT WILL IT ANSWER?
WILL IT MAKE YOU HAPPY?  WILL IT NOT BE WISER TO ACCEPT THE SOCIETY OF
THOSE GOOD LADIES IN LAURA PLACE, AND ENJOY ALL THE ADVANTAGES OF THE
CONNEXION AS FAR AS POSSIBLE?  YOU MAY DEPEND UPON IT, THAT THEY WILL
MOVE IN THE FIRST SET IN BATH THIS WINTER, AND AS RANK IS RANK, YOUR
BEING KNOWN TO BE RELATED TO THEM WILL HAVE ITS USE IN FIXING YOUR
FAMILY (OUR FAMILY LET ME SAY) IN THAT DEGREE OF CONSIDERATION WHICH WE
MUST ALL WISH FOR."

"YES," SIGHED ANNE, "WE SHALL, INDEED, BE KNOWN TO BE RELATED TO THEM!"
THEN RECOLLECTING HERSELF, AND NOT WISHING TO BE ANSWERED, SHE ADDED,
"I CERTAINLY DO THINK THERE HAS BEEN BY FAR TOO MUCH TROUBLE TAKEN TO
PROCURE THE ACQUAINTANCE.  I SUPPOSE" (SMILING) "I HAVE MORE PRIDE THAN
ANY OF YOU; BUT I CONFESS IT DOES VEX ME, THAT WE SHOULD BE SO
SOLICITOUS TO HAVE THE RELATIONSHIP ACKNOWLEDGED, WHICH WE MAY BE VERY
SURE IS A MATTER OF PERFECT INDIFFERENCE TO THEM."

"PARDON ME, DEAR COUSIN, YOU ARE UNJUST IN YOUR OWN CLAIMS.  IN LONDON,
PERHAPS, IN YOUR PRESENT QUIET STYLE OF LIVING, IT MIGHT BE AS YOU SAY:
BUT IN BATH; SIR WALTER ELLIOT AND HIS FAMILY WILL ALWAYS BE WORTH
KNOWING:  ALWAYS ACCEPTABLE AS ACQUAINTANCE."

"WELL," SAID ANNE, "I CERTAINLY AM PROUD, TOO PROUD TO ENJOY A WELCOME
WHICH DEPENDS SO ENTIRELY UPON PLACE."

"I LOVE YOUR INDIGNATION," SAID HE; "IT IS VERY NATURAL.  BUT HERE YOU
ARE IN BATH, AND THE OBJECT IS TO BE ESTABLISHED HERE WITH ALL THE
CREDIT AND DIGNITY WHICH OUGHT TO BELONG TO SIR WALTER ELLIOT.  YOU
TALK OF BEING PROUD; I AM CALLED PROUD, I KNOW, AND I SHALL NOT WISH TO
BELIEVE MYSELF OTHERWISE; FOR OUR PRIDE, IF INVESTIGATED, WOULD HAVE
THE SAME OBJECT, I HAVE NO DOUBT, THOUGH THE KIND MAY SEEM A LITTLE
DIFFERENT.  IN ONE POINT, I AM SURE, MY DEAR COUSIN," (HE CONTINUED,
SPEAKING LOWER, THOUGH THERE WAS NO ONE ELSE IN THE ROOM) "IN ONE
POINT, I AM SURE, WE MUST FEEL ALIKE.  WE MUST FEEL THAT EVERY ADDITION
TO YOUR FATHER'S SOCIETY, AMONG HIS EQUALS OR SUPERIORS, MAY BE OF USE
IN DIVERTING HIS THOUGHTS FROM THOSE WHO ARE BENEATH HIM."

HE LOOKED, AS HE SPOKE, TO THE SEAT WHICH MRS CLAY HAD BEEN LATELY
OCCUPYING:  A SUFFICIENT EXPLANATION OF WHAT HE PARTICULARLY MEANT; AND
THOUGH ANNE COULD NOT BELIEVE IN THEIR HAVING THE SAME SORT OF PRIDE,
SHE WAS PLEASED WITH HIM FOR NOT LIKING MRS CLAY; AND HER CONSCIENCE
ADMITTED THAT HIS WISHING TO PROMOTE HER FATHER'S GETTING GREAT
ACQUAINTANCE WAS MORE THAN EXCUSABLE IN THE VIEW OF DEFEATING HER.



CHAPTER 17


WHILE SIR WALTER AND ELIZABETH WERE ASSIDUOUSLY PUSHING THEIR GOOD
FORTUNE IN LAURA PLACE, ANNE WAS RENEWING AN ACQUAINTANCE OF A VERY
DIFFERENT DESCRIPTION.

SHE HAD CALLED ON HER FORMER GOVERNESS, AND HAD HEARD FROM HER OF THERE
BEING AN OLD SCHOOL-FELLOW IN BATH, WHO HAD THE TWO STRONG CLAIMS ON
HER ATTENTION OF PAST KINDNESS AND PRESENT SUFFERING.  MISS HAMILTON,
NOW MRS SMITH, HAD SHEWN HER KINDNESS IN ONE OF THOSE PERIODS OF HER
LIFE WHEN IT HAD BEEN MOST VALUABLE.  ANNE HAD GONE UNHAPPY TO SCHOOL,
GRIEVING FOR THE LOSS OF A MOTHER WHOM SHE HAD DEARLY LOVED, FEELING
HER SEPARATION FROM HOME, AND SUFFERING AS A GIRL OF FOURTEEN, OF
STRONG SENSIBILITY AND NOT HIGH SPIRITS, MUST SUFFER AT SUCH A TIME;
AND MISS HAMILTON, THREE YEARS OLDER THAN HERSELF, BUT STILL FROM THE
WANT OF NEAR RELATIONS AND A SETTLED HOME, REMAINING ANOTHER YEAR AT
SCHOOL, HAD BEEN USEFUL AND GOOD TO HER IN A WAY WHICH HAD CONSIDERABLY
LESSENED HER MISERY, AND COULD NEVER BE REMEMBERED WITH INDIFFERENCE.

MISS HAMILTON HAD LEFT SCHOOL, HAD MARRIED NOT LONG AFTERWARDS, WAS
SAID TO HAVE MARRIED A MAN OF FORTUNE, AND THIS WAS ALL THAT ANNE HAD
KNOWN OF HER, TILL NOW THAT THEIR GOVERNESS'S ACCOUNT BROUGHT HER
SITUATION FORWARD IN A MORE DECIDED BUT VERY DIFFERENT FORM.

SHE WAS A WIDOW AND POOR.  HER HUSBAND HAD BEEN EXTRAVAGANT; AND AT HIS
DEATH, ABOUT TWO YEARS BEFORE, HAD LEFT HIS AFFAIRS DREADFULLY
INVOLVED.  SHE HAD HAD DIFFICULTIES OF EVERY SORT TO CONTEND WITH, AND
IN ADDITION TO THESE DISTRESSES HAD BEEN AFFLICTED WITH A SEVERE
RHEUMATIC FEVER, WHICH, FINALLY SETTLING IN HER LEGS, HAD MADE HER FOR
THE PRESENT A CRIPPLE.  SHE HAD COME TO BATH ON THAT ACCOUNT, AND WAS
NOW IN LODGINGS NEAR THE HOT BATHS, LIVING IN A VERY HUMBLE WAY, UNABLE
EVEN TO AFFORD HERSELF THE COMFORT OF A SERVANT, AND OF COURSE ALMOST
EXCLUDED FROM SOCIETY.

THEIR MUTUAL FRIEND ANSWERED FOR THE SATISFACTION WHICH A VISIT FROM
MISS ELLIOT WOULD GIVE MRS SMITH, AND ANNE THEREFORE LOST NO TIME IN
GOING.  SHE MENTIONED NOTHING OF WHAT SHE HAD HEARD, OR WHAT SHE
INTENDED, AT HOME.  IT WOULD EXCITE NO PROPER INTEREST THERE.  SHE ONLY
CONSULTED LADY RUSSELL, WHO ENTERED THOROUGHLY INTO HER SENTIMENTS, AND
WAS MOST HAPPY TO CONVEY HER AS NEAR TO MRS SMITH'S LODGINGS IN
WESTGATE BUILDINGS, AS ANNE CHOSE TO BE TAKEN.

THE VISIT WAS PAID, THEIR ACQUAINTANCE RE-ESTABLISHED, THEIR INTEREST
IN EACH OTHER MORE THAN RE-KINDLED.  THE FIRST TEN MINUTES HAD ITS
AWKWARDNESS AND ITS EMOTION.  TWELVE YEARS WERE GONE SINCE THEY HAD
PARTED, AND EACH PRESENTED A SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT PERSON FROM WHAT THE
OTHER HAD IMAGINED.  TWELVE YEARS HAD CHANGED ANNE FROM THE BLOOMING,
SILENT, UNFORMED GIRL OF FIFTEEN, TO THE ELEGANT LITTLE WOMAN OF
SEVEN-AND-TWENTY, WITH EVERY BEAUTY EXCEPT BLOOM, AND WITH MANNERS AS
CONSCIOUSLY RIGHT AS THEY WERE INVARIABLY GENTLE; AND TWELVE YEARS HAD
TRANSFORMED THE FINE-LOOKING, WELL-GROWN MISS HAMILTON, IN ALL THE GLOW
OF HEALTH AND CONFIDENCE OF SUPERIORITY, INTO A POOR, INFIRM, HELPLESS
WIDOW, RECEIVING THE VISIT OF HER FORMER PROTEGEE AS A FAVOUR; BUT ALL
THAT WAS UNCOMFORTABLE IN THE MEETING HAD SOON PASSED AWAY, AND LEFT
ONLY THE INTERESTING CHARM OF REMEMBERING FORMER PARTIALITIES AND
TALKING OVER OLD TIMES.

ANNE FOUND IN MRS SMITH THE GOOD SENSE AND AGREEABLE MANNERS WHICH SHE
HAD ALMOST VENTURED TO DEPEND ON, AND A DISPOSITION TO CONVERSE AND BE
CHEERFUL BEYOND HER EXPECTATION.  NEITHER THE DISSIPATIONS OF THE
PAST--AND SHE HAD LIVED VERY MUCH IN THE WORLD--NOR THE RESTRICTIONS OF
THE PRESENT, NEITHER SICKNESS NOR SORROW SEEMED TO HAVE CLOSED HER
HEART OR RUINED HER SPIRITS.

IN THE COURSE OF A SECOND VISIT SHE TALKED WITH GREAT OPENNESS, AND
ANNE'S ASTONISHMENT INCREASED.  SHE COULD SCARCELY IMAGINE A MORE
CHEERLESS SITUATION IN ITSELF THAN MRS SMITH'S.  SHE HAD BEEN VERY FOND
OF HER HUSBAND:  SHE HAD BURIED HIM.  SHE HAD BEEN USED TO AFFLUENCE:
IT WAS GONE.  SHE HAD NO CHILD TO CONNECT HER WITH LIFE AND HAPPINESS
AGAIN, NO RELATIONS TO ASSIST IN THE ARRANGEMENT OF PERPLEXED AFFAIRS,
NO HEALTH TO MAKE ALL THE REST SUPPORTABLE.  HER ACCOMMODATIONS WERE
LIMITED TO A NOISY PARLOUR, AND A DARK BEDROOM BEHIND, WITH NO
POSSIBILITY OF MOVING FROM ONE TO THE OTHER WITHOUT ASSISTANCE, WHICH
THERE WAS ONLY ONE SERVANT IN THE HOUSE TO AFFORD, AND SHE NEVER
QUITTED THE HOUSE BUT TO BE CONVEYED INTO THE WARM BATH.  YET, IN SPITE
OF ALL THIS, ANNE HAD REASON TO BELIEVE THAT SHE HAD MOMENTS ONLY OF
LANGUOR AND DEPRESSION, TO HOURS OF OCCUPATION AND ENJOYMENT.  HOW
COULD IT BE?  SHE WATCHED, OBSERVED, REFLECTED, AND FINALLY DETERMINED
THAT THIS WAS NOT A CASE OF FORTITUDE OR OF RESIGNATION ONLY.  A
SUBMISSIVE SPIRIT MIGHT BE PATIENT, A STRONG UNDERSTANDING WOULD SUPPLY
RESOLUTION, BUT HERE WAS SOMETHING MORE; HERE WAS THAT ELASTICITY OF
MIND, THAT DISPOSITION TO BE COMFORTED, THAT POWER OF TURNING READILY
FROM EVIL TO GOOD, AND OF FINDING EMPLOYMENT WHICH CARRIED HER OUT OF
HERSELF, WHICH WAS FROM NATURE ALONE.  IT WAS THE CHOICEST GIFT OF
HEAVEN; AND ANNE VIEWED HER FRIEND AS ONE OF THOSE INSTANCES IN WHICH,
BY A MERCIFUL APPOINTMENT, IT SEEMS DESIGNED TO COUNTERBALANCE ALMOST
EVERY OTHER WANT.

THERE HAD BEEN A TIME, MRS SMITH TOLD HER, WHEN HER SPIRITS HAD NEARLY
FAILED.  SHE COULD NOT CALL HERSELF AN INVALID NOW, COMPARED WITH HER
STATE ON FIRST REACHING BATH.  THEN SHE HAD, INDEED, BEEN A PITIABLE
OBJECT; FOR SHE HAD CAUGHT COLD ON THE JOURNEY, AND HAD HARDLY TAKEN
POSSESSION OF HER LODGINGS BEFORE SHE WAS AGAIN CONFINED TO HER BED AND
SUFFERING UNDER SEVERE AND CONSTANT PAIN; AND ALL THIS AMONG STRANGERS,
WITH THE ABSOLUTE NECESSITY OF HAVING A REGULAR NURSE, AND FINANCES AT
THAT MOMENT PARTICULARLY UNFIT TO MEET ANY EXTRAORDINARY EXPENSE.  SHE
HAD WEATHERED IT, HOWEVER, AND COULD TRULY SAY THAT IT HAD DONE HER
GOOD.  IT HAD INCREASED HER COMFORTS BY MAKING HER FEEL HERSELF TO BE
IN GOOD HANDS.  SHE HAD SEEN TOO MUCH OF THE WORLD, TO EXPECT SUDDEN OR
DISINTERESTED ATTACHMENT ANYWHERE, BUT HER ILLNESS HAD PROVED TO HER
THAT HER LANDLADY HAD A CHARACTER TO PRESERVE, AND WOULD NOT USE HER
ILL; AND SHE HAD BEEN PARTICULARLY FORTUNATE IN HER NURSE, AS A SISTER
OF HER LANDLADY, A NURSE BY PROFESSION, AND WHO HAD ALWAYS A HOME IN
THAT HOUSE WHEN UNEMPLOYED, CHANCED TO BE AT LIBERTY JUST IN TIME TO
ATTEND HER.  "AND SHE," SAID MRS SMITH, "BESIDES NURSING ME MOST
ADMIRABLY, HAS REALLY PROVED AN INVALUABLE ACQUAINTANCE.  AS SOON AS I
COULD USE MY HANDS SHE TAUGHT ME TO KNIT, WHICH HAS BEEN A GREAT
AMUSEMENT; AND SHE PUT ME IN THE WAY OF MAKING THESE LITTLE
THREAD-CASES, PIN-CUSHIONS AND CARD-RACKS, WHICH YOU ALWAYS FIND ME SO
BUSY ABOUT, AND WHICH SUPPLY ME WITH THE MEANS OF DOING A LITTLE GOOD
TO ONE OR TWO VERY POOR FAMILIES IN THIS NEIGHBOURHOOD.  SHE HAD A
LARGE ACQUAINTANCE, OF COURSE PROFESSIONALLY, AMONG THOSE WHO CAN
AFFORD TO BUY, AND SHE DISPOSES OF MY MERCHANDISE.  SHE ALWAYS TAKES
THE RIGHT TIME FOR APPLYING.  EVERYBODY'S HEART IS OPEN, YOU KNOW, WHEN
THEY HAVE RECENTLY ESCAPED FROM SEVERE PAIN, OR ARE RECOVERING THE
BLESSING OF HEALTH, AND NURSE ROOKE THOROUGHLY UNDERSTANDS WHEN TO
SPEAK.  SHE IS A SHREWD, INTELLIGENT, SENSIBLE WOMAN.  HERS IS A LINE
FOR SEEING HUMAN NATURE; AND SHE HAS A FUND OF GOOD SENSE AND
OBSERVATION, WHICH, AS A COMPANION, MAKE HER INFINITELY SUPERIOR TO
THOUSANDS OF THOSE WHO HAVING ONLY RECEIVED 'THE BEST EDUCATION IN THE
WORLD,' KNOW NOTHING WORTH ATTENDING TO.  CALL IT GOSSIP, IF YOU WILL,
BUT WHEN NURSE ROOKE HAS HALF AN HOUR'S LEISURE TO BESTOW ON ME, SHE IS
SURE TO HAVE SOMETHING TO RELATE THAT IS ENTERTAINING AND PROFITABLE:
SOMETHING THAT MAKES ONE KNOW ONE'S SPECIES BETTER.  ONE LIKES TO HEAR
WHAT IS GOING ON, TO BE AU FAIT AS TO THE NEWEST MODES OF BEING
TRIFLING AND SILLY.  TO ME, WHO LIVE SO MUCH ALONE, HER CONVERSATION, I
ASSURE YOU, IS A TREAT."

ANNE, FAR FROM WISHING TO CAVIL AT THE PLEASURE, REPLIED, "I CAN EASILY
BELIEVE IT.  WOMEN OF THAT CLASS HAVE GREAT OPPORTUNITIES, AND IF THEY
ARE INTELLIGENT MAY BE WELL WORTH LISTENING TO.  SUCH VARIETIES OF
HUMAN NATURE AS THEY ARE IN THE HABIT OF WITNESSING!  AND IT IS NOT
MERELY IN ITS FOLLIES, THAT THEY ARE WELL READ; FOR THEY SEE IT
OCCASIONALLY UNDER EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE THAT CAN BE MOST INTERESTING OR
AFFECTING.  WHAT INSTANCES MUST PASS BEFORE THEM OF ARDENT,
DISINTERESTED, SELF-DENYING ATTACHMENT, OF HEROISM, FORTITUDE,
PATIENCE, RESIGNATION:  OF ALL THE CONFLICTS AND ALL THE SACRIFICES
THAT ENNOBLE US MOST.  A SICK CHAMBER MAY OFTEN FURNISH THE WORTH OF
VOLUMES."

"YES," SAID MRS SMITH MORE DOUBTINGLY, "SOMETIMES IT MAY, THOUGH I FEAR
ITS LESSONS ARE NOT OFTEN IN THE ELEVATED STYLE YOU DESCRIBE.  HERE AND
THERE, HUMAN NATURE MAY BE GREAT IN TIMES OF TRIAL; BUT GENERALLY
SPEAKING, IT IS ITS WEAKNESS AND NOT ITS STRENGTH THAT APPEARS IN A
SICK CHAMBER:  IT IS SELFISHNESS AND IMPATIENCE RATHER THAN GENEROSITY
AND FORTITUDE, THAT ONE HEARS OF.  THERE IS SO LITTLE REAL FRIENDSHIP
IN THE WORLD! AND UNFORTUNATELY" (SPEAKING LOW AND TREMULOUSLY) "THERE
ARE SO MANY WHO FORGET TO THINK SERIOUSLY TILL IT IS ALMOST TOO LATE."

ANNE SAW THE MISERY OF SUCH FEELINGS.  THE HUSBAND HAD NOT BEEN WHAT HE
OUGHT, AND THE WIFE HAD BEEN LED AMONG THAT PART OF MANKIND WHICH MADE
HER THINK WORSE OF THE WORLD THAN SHE HOPED IT DESERVED.  IT WAS BUT A
PASSING EMOTION HOWEVER WITH MRS SMITH; SHE SHOOK IT OFF, AND SOON
ADDED IN A DIFFERENT TONE--

"I DO NOT SUPPOSE THE SITUATION MY FRIEND MRS ROOKE IS IN AT PRESENT,
WILL FURNISH MUCH EITHER TO INTEREST OR EDIFY ME.  SHE IS ONLY NURSING
MRS WALLIS OF MARLBOROUGH BUILDINGS; A MERE PRETTY, SILLY, EXPENSIVE,
FASHIONABLE WOMAN, I BELIEVE; AND OF COURSE WILL HAVE NOTHING TO REPORT
BUT OF LACE AND FINERY.  I MEAN TO MAKE MY PROFIT OF MRS WALLIS,
HOWEVER.  SHE HAS PLENTY OF MONEY, AND I INTEND SHE SHALL BUY ALL THE
HIGH-PRICED THINGS I HAVE IN HAND NOW."

ANNE HAD CALLED SEVERAL TIMES ON HER FRIEND, BEFORE THE EXISTENCE OF
SUCH A PERSON WAS KNOWN IN CAMDEN PLACE.  AT LAST, IT BECAME NECESSARY
TO SPEAK OF HER. SIR WALTER, ELIZABETH AND MRS CLAY, RETURNED ONE
MORNING FROM LAURA PLACE, WITH A SUDDEN INVITATION FROM LADY DALRYMPLE
FOR THE SAME EVENING, AND ANNE WAS ALREADY ENGAGED, TO SPEND THAT
EVENING IN WESTGATE BUILDINGS.  SHE WAS NOT SORRY FOR THE EXCUSE.  THEY
WERE ONLY ASKED, SHE WAS SURE, BECAUSE LADY DALRYMPLE BEING KEPT AT
HOME BY A BAD COLD, WAS GLAD TO MAKE USE OF THE RELATIONSHIP WHICH HAD
BEEN SO PRESSED ON HER; AND SHE DECLINED ON HER OWN ACCOUNT WITH GREAT
ALACRITY--"SHE WAS ENGAGED TO SPEND THE EVENING WITH AN OLD
SCHOOLFELLOW."  THEY WERE NOT MUCH INTERESTED IN ANYTHING RELATIVE TO
ANNE; BUT STILL THERE WERE QUESTIONS ENOUGH ASKED, TO MAKE IT
UNDERSTOOD WHAT THIS OLD SCHOOLFELLOW WAS; AND ELIZABETH WAS
DISDAINFUL, AND SIR WALTER SEVERE.

"WESTGATE BUILDINGS!" SAID HE, "AND WHO IS MISS ANNE ELLIOT TO BE
VISITING IN WESTGATE BUILDINGS?  A MRS SMITH.  A WIDOW MRS SMITH; AND
WHO WAS HER HUSBAND?  ONE OF FIVE THOUSAND MR SMITHS WHOSE NAMES ARE TO
BE MET WITH EVERYWHERE.  AND WHAT IS HER ATTRACTION?  THAT SHE IS OLD
AND SICKLY.  UPON MY WORD, MISS ANNE ELLIOT, YOU HAVE THE MOST
EXTRAORDINARY TASTE!  EVERYTHING THAT REVOLTS OTHER PEOPLE, LOW
COMPANY, PALTRY ROOMS, FOUL AIR, DISGUSTING ASSOCIATIONS ARE INVITING
TO YOU.  BUT SURELY YOU MAY PUT OFF THIS OLD LADY TILL TO-MORROW:  SHE
IS NOT SO NEAR HER END, I PRESUME, BUT THAT SHE MAY HOPE TO SEE ANOTHER
DAY.  WHAT IS HER AGE?  FORTY?"

"NO, SIR, SHE IS NOT ONE-AND-THIRTY; BUT I DO NOT THINK I CAN PUT OFF
MY ENGAGEMENT, BECAUSE IT IS THE ONLY EVENING FOR SOME TIME WHICH WILL
AT ONCE SUIT HER AND MYSELF.  SHE GOES INTO THE WARM BATH TO-MORROW,
AND FOR THE REST OF THE WEEK, YOU KNOW, WE ARE ENGAGED."

"BUT WHAT DOES LADY RUSSELL THINK OF THIS ACQUAINTANCE?" ASKED
ELIZABETH.

"SHE SEES NOTHING TO BLAME IN IT," REPLIED ANNE; "ON THE CONTRARY, SHE
APPROVES IT, AND HAS GENERALLY TAKEN ME WHEN I HAVE CALLED ON MRS
SMITH."

"WESTGATE BUILDINGS MUST HAVE BEEN RATHER SURPRISED BY THE APPEARANCE
OF A CARRIAGE DRAWN UP NEAR ITS PAVEMENT," OBSERVED SIR WALTER.  "SIR
HENRY RUSSELL'S WIDOW, INDEED, HAS NO HONOURS TO DISTINGUISH HER ARMS,
BUT STILL IT IS A HANDSOME EQUIPAGE, AND NO DOUBT IS WELL KNOWN TO
CONVEY A MISS ELLIOT.  A WIDOW MRS SMITH LODGING IN WESTGATE BUILDINGS!
A POOR WIDOW BARELY ABLE TO LIVE, BETWEEN THIRTY AND FORTY; A MERE MRS
SMITH, AN EVERY-DAY MRS SMITH, OF ALL PEOPLE AND ALL NAMES IN THE
WORLD, TO BE THE CHOSEN FRIEND OF MISS ANNE ELLIOT, AND TO BE PREFERRED
BY HER TO HER OWN FAMILY CONNECTIONS AMONG THE NOBILITY OF ENGLAND AND
IRELAND!  MRS SMITH!  SUCH A NAME!"

MRS CLAY, WHO HAD BEEN PRESENT WHILE ALL THIS PASSED, NOW THOUGHT IT
ADVISABLE TO LEAVE THE ROOM, AND ANNE COULD HAVE SAID MUCH, AND DID
LONG TO SAY A LITTLE IN DEFENCE OF HER FRIEND'S NOT VERY DISSIMILAR
CLAIMS TO THEIRS, BUT HER SENSE OF PERSONAL RESPECT TO HER FATHER
PREVENTED HER.  SHE MADE NO REPLY.  SHE LEFT IT TO HIMSELF TO
RECOLLECT, THAT MRS SMITH WAS NOT THE ONLY WIDOW IN BATH BETWEEN THIRTY
AND FORTY, WITH LITTLE TO LIVE ON, AND NO SURNAME OF DIGNITY.

ANNE KEPT HER APPOINTMENT; THE OTHERS KEPT THEIRS, AND OF COURSE SHE
HEARD THE NEXT MORNING THAT THEY HAD HAD A DELIGHTFUL EVENING.  SHE HAD
BEEN THE ONLY ONE OF THE SET ABSENT, FOR SIR WALTER AND ELIZABETH HAD
NOT ONLY BEEN QUITE AT HER LADYSHIP'S SERVICE THEMSELVES, BUT HAD
ACTUALLY BEEN HAPPY TO BE EMPLOYED BY HER IN COLLECTING OTHERS, AND HAD
BEEN AT THE TROUBLE OF INVITING BOTH LADY RUSSELL AND MR ELLIOT; AND MR
ELLIOT HAD MADE A POINT OF LEAVING COLONEL WALLIS EARLY, AND LADY
RUSSELL HAD FRESH ARRANGED ALL HER EVENING ENGAGEMENTS IN ORDER TO WAIT
ON HER.  ANNE HAD THE WHOLE HISTORY OF ALL THAT SUCH AN EVENING COULD
SUPPLY FROM LADY RUSSELL.  TO HER, ITS GREATEST INTEREST MUST BE, IN
HAVING BEEN VERY MUCH TALKED OF BETWEEN HER FRIEND AND MR ELLIOT; IN
HAVING BEEN WISHED FOR, REGRETTED, AND AT THE SAME TIME HONOURED FOR
STAYING AWAY IN SUCH A CAUSE.  HER KIND, COMPASSIONATE VISITS TO THIS
OLD SCHOOLFELLOW, SICK AND REDUCED, SEEMED TO HAVE QUITE DELIGHTED MR
ELLIOT.  HE THOUGHT HER A MOST EXTRAORDINARY YOUNG WOMAN; IN HER
TEMPER, MANNERS, MIND, A MODEL OF FEMALE EXCELLENCE.  HE COULD MEET
EVEN LADY RUSSELL IN A DISCUSSION OF HER MERITS; AND ANNE COULD NOT BE
GIVEN TO UNDERSTAND SO MUCH BY HER FRIEND, COULD NOT KNOW HERSELF TO BE
SO HIGHLY RATED BY A SENSIBLE MAN, WITHOUT MANY OF THOSE AGREEABLE
SENSATIONS WHICH HER FRIEND MEANT TO CREATE.

LADY RUSSELL WAS NOW PERFECTLY DECIDED IN HER OPINION OF MR ELLIOT.
SHE WAS AS MUCH CONVINCED OF HIS MEANING TO GAIN ANNE IN TIME AS OF HIS
DESERVING HER, AND WAS BEGINNING TO CALCULATE THE NUMBER OF WEEKS WHICH
WOULD FREE HIM FROM ALL THE REMAINING RESTRAINTS OF WIDOWHOOD, AND
LEAVE HIM AT LIBERTY TO EXERT HIS MOST OPEN POWERS OF PLEASING.  SHE
WOULD NOT SPEAK TO ANNE WITH HALF THE CERTAINTY SHE FELT ON THE
SUBJECT, SHE WOULD VENTURE ON LITTLE MORE THAN HINTS OF WHAT MIGHT BE
HEREAFTER, OF A POSSIBLE ATTACHMENT ON HIS SIDE, OF THE DESIRABLENESS
OF THE ALLIANCE, SUPPOSING SUCH ATTACHMENT TO BE REAL AND RETURNED.
ANNE HEARD HER, AND MADE NO VIOLENT EXCLAMATIONS; SHE ONLY SMILED,
BLUSHED, AND GENTLY SHOOK HER HEAD.

"I AM NO MATCH-MAKER, AS YOU WELL KNOW," SAID LADY RUSSELL, "BEING MUCH
TOO WELL AWARE OF THE UNCERTAINTY OF ALL HUMAN EVENTS AND CALCULATIONS.
I ONLY MEAN THAT IF MR ELLIOT SHOULD SOME TIME HENCE PAY HIS ADDRESSES
TO YOU, AND IF YOU SHOULD BE DISPOSED TO ACCEPT HIM, I THINK THERE
WOULD BE EVERY POSSIBILITY OF YOUR BEING HAPPY TOGETHER.  A MOST
SUITABLE CONNECTION EVERYBODY MUST CONSIDER IT, BUT I THINK IT MIGHT BE
A VERY HAPPY ONE."

"MR ELLIOT IS AN EXCEEDINGLY AGREEABLE MAN, AND IN MANY RESPECTS I
THINK HIGHLY OF HIM," SAID ANNE; "BUT WE SHOULD NOT SUIT."

LADY RUSSELL LET THIS PASS, AND ONLY SAID IN REJOINDER, "I OWN THAT TO
BE ABLE TO REGARD YOU AS THE FUTURE MISTRESS OF KELLYNCH, THE FUTURE
LADY ELLIOT, TO LOOK FORWARD AND SEE YOU OCCUPYING YOUR DEAR MOTHER'S
PLACE, SUCCEEDING TO ALL HER RIGHTS, AND ALL HER POPULARITY, AS WELL AS
TO ALL HER VIRTUES, WOULD BE THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE GRATIFICATION TO ME.
YOU ARE YOUR MOTHER'S SELF IN COUNTENANCE AND DISPOSITION; AND IF I
MIGHT BE ALLOWED TO FANCY YOU SUCH AS SHE WAS, IN SITUATION AND NAME,
AND HOME, PRESIDING AND BLESSING IN THE SAME SPOT, AND ONLY SUPERIOR TO
HER IN BEING MORE HIGHLY VALUED!  MY DEAREST ANNE, IT WOULD GIVE ME
MORE DELIGHT THAN IS OFTEN FELT AT MY TIME OF LIFE!"

ANNE WAS OBLIGED TO TURN AWAY, TO RISE, TO WALK TO A DISTANT TABLE,
AND, LEANING THERE IN PRETENDED EMPLOYMENT, TRY TO SUBDUE THE FEELINGS
THIS PICTURE EXCITED.  FOR A FEW MOMENTS HER IMAGINATION AND HER HEART
WERE BEWITCHED.  THE IDEA OF BECOMING WHAT HER MOTHER HAD BEEN; OF
HAVING THE PRECIOUS NAME OF "LADY ELLIOT" FIRST REVIVED IN HERSELF; OF
BEING RESTORED TO KELLYNCH, CALLING IT HER HOME AGAIN, HER HOME FOR
EVER, WAS A CHARM WHICH SHE COULD NOT IMMEDIATELY RESIST.  LADY RUSSELL
SAID NOT ANOTHER WORD, WILLING TO LEAVE THE MATTER TO ITS OWN
OPERATION; AND BELIEVING THAT, COULD MR ELLIOT AT THAT MOMENT WITH
PROPRIETY HAVE SPOKEN FOR HIMSELF!--SHE BELIEVED, IN SHORT, WHAT ANNE
DID NOT BELIEVE.  THE SAME IMAGE OF MR ELLIOT SPEAKING FOR HIMSELF
BROUGHT ANNE TO COMPOSURE AGAIN.  THE CHARM OF KELLYNCH AND OF "LADY
ELLIOT" ALL FADED AWAY.  SHE NEVER COULD ACCEPT HIM.  AND IT WAS NOT
ONLY THAT HER FEELINGS WERE STILL ADVERSE TO ANY MAN SAVE ONE; HER
JUDGEMENT, ON A SERIOUS CONSIDERATION OF THE POSSIBILITIES OF SUCH A
CASE WAS AGAINST MR ELLIOT.

THOUGH THEY HAD NOW BEEN ACQUAINTED A MONTH, SHE COULD NOT BE SATISFIED
THAT SHE REALLY KNEW HIS CHARACTER.  THAT HE WAS A SENSIBLE MAN, AN
AGREEABLE MAN, THAT HE TALKED WELL, PROFESSED GOOD OPINIONS, SEEMED TO
JUDGE PROPERLY AND AS A MAN OF PRINCIPLE, THIS WAS ALL CLEAR ENOUGH.
HE CERTAINLY KNEW WHAT WAS RIGHT, NOR COULD SHE FIX ON ANY ONE ARTICLE
OF MORAL DUTY EVIDENTLY TRANSGRESSED; BUT YET SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN
AFRAID TO ANSWER FOR HIS CONDUCT.  SHE DISTRUSTED THE PAST, IF NOT THE
PRESENT.  THE NAMES WHICH OCCASIONALLY DROPT OF FORMER ASSOCIATES, THE
ALLUSIONS TO FORMER PRACTICES AND PURSUITS, SUGGESTED SUSPICIONS NOT
FAVOURABLE OF WHAT HE HAD BEEN.  SHE SAW THAT THERE HAD BEEN BAD
HABITS; THAT SUNDAY TRAVELLING HAD BEEN A COMMON THING; THAT THERE HAD
BEEN A PERIOD OF HIS LIFE (AND PROBABLY NOT A SHORT ONE) WHEN HE HAD
BEEN, AT LEAST, CARELESS IN ALL SERIOUS MATTERS; AND, THOUGH HE MIGHT
NOW THINK VERY DIFFERENTLY, WHO COULD ANSWER FOR THE TRUE SENTIMENTS OF
A CLEVER, CAUTIOUS MAN, GROWN OLD ENOUGH TO APPRECIATE A FAIR
CHARACTER?  HOW COULD IT EVER BE ASCERTAINED THAT HIS MIND WAS TRULY
CLEANSED?

MR ELLIOT WAS RATIONAL, DISCREET, POLISHED, BUT HE WAS NOT OPEN.  THERE
WAS NEVER ANY BURST OF FEELING, ANY WARMTH OF INDIGNATION OR DELIGHT,
AT THE EVIL OR GOOD OF OTHERS.  THIS, TO ANNE, WAS A DECIDED
IMPERFECTION.  HER EARLY IMPRESSIONS WERE INCURABLE.  SHE PRIZED THE
FRANK, THE OPEN-HEARTED, THE EAGER CHARACTER BEYOND ALL OTHERS.  WARMTH
AND ENTHUSIASM DID CAPTIVATE HER STILL.  SHE FELT THAT SHE COULD SO
MUCH MORE DEPEND UPON THE SINCERITY OF THOSE WHO SOMETIMES LOOKED OR
SAID A CARELESS OR A HASTY THING, THAN OF THOSE WHOSE PRESENCE OF MIND
NEVER VARIED, WHOSE TONGUE NEVER SLIPPED.

MR ELLIOT WAS TOO GENERALLY AGREEABLE.  VARIOUS AS WERE THE TEMPERS IN
HER FATHER'S HOUSE, HE PLEASED THEM ALL.  HE ENDURED TOO WELL, STOOD
TOO WELL WITH EVERY BODY.  HE HAD SPOKEN TO HER WITH SOME DEGREE OF
OPENNESS OF MRS CLAY; HAD APPEARED COMPLETELY TO SEE WHAT MRS CLAY WAS
ABOUT, AND TO HOLD HER IN CONTEMPT; AND YET MRS CLAY FOUND HIM AS
AGREEABLE AS ANY BODY.

LADY RUSSELL SAW EITHER LESS OR MORE THAN HER YOUNG FRIEND, FOR SHE SAW
NOTHING TO EXCITE DISTRUST.  SHE COULD NOT IMAGINE A MAN MORE EXACTLY
WHAT HE OUGHT TO BE THAN MR ELLIOT; NOR DID SHE EVER ENJOY A SWEETER
FEELING THAN THE HOPE OF SEEING HIM RECEIVE THE HAND OF HER BELOVED
ANNE IN KELLYNCH CHURCH, IN THE COURSE OF THE FOLLOWING AUTUMN.



CHAPTER 18


IT WAS THE BEGINNING OF FEBRUARY; AND ANNE, HAVING BEEN A MONTH IN
BATH, WAS GROWING VERY EAGER FOR NEWS FROM UPPERCROSS AND LYME.  SHE
WANTED TO HEAR MUCH MORE THAN MARY HAD COMMUNICATED.  IT WAS THREE
WEEKS SINCE SHE HAD HEARD AT ALL.  SHE ONLY KNEW THAT HENRIETTA WAS AT
HOME AGAIN; AND THAT LOUISA, THOUGH CONSIDERED TO BE RECOVERING FAST,
WAS STILL IN LYME; AND SHE WAS THINKING OF THEM ALL VERY INTENTLY ONE
EVENING, WHEN A THICKER LETTER THAN USUAL FROM MARY WAS DELIVERED TO
HER; AND, TO QUICKEN THE PLEASURE AND SURPRISE, WITH ADMIRAL AND MRS
CROFT'S COMPLIMENTS.

THE CROFTS MUST BE IN BATH!  A CIRCUMSTANCE TO INTEREST HER.  THEY WERE
PEOPLE WHOM HER HEART TURNED TO VERY NATURALLY.

"WHAT IS THIS?" CRIED SIR WALTER.  "THE CROFTS HAVE ARRIVED IN BATH?
THE CROFTS WHO RENT KELLYNCH?  WHAT HAVE THEY BROUGHT YOU?"

"A LETTER FROM UPPERCROSS COTTAGE, SIR."

"OH! THOSE LETTERS ARE CONVENIENT PASSPORTS.  THEY SECURE AN
INTRODUCTION.  I SHOULD HAVE VISITED ADMIRAL CROFT, HOWEVER, AT ANY
RATE.  I KNOW WHAT IS DUE TO MY TENANT."

ANNE COULD LISTEN NO LONGER; SHE COULD NOT EVEN HAVE TOLD HOW THE POOR
ADMIRAL'S COMPLEXION ESCAPED; HER LETTER ENGROSSED HER.  IT HAD BEEN
BEGUN SEVERAL DAYS BACK.


"FEBRUARY 1ST.

"MY DEAR ANNE,--I MAKE NO APOLOGY FOR MY SILENCE, BECAUSE I KNOW HOW
LITTLE PEOPLE THINK OF LETTERS IN SUCH A PLACE AS BATH.  YOU MUST BE A
GREAT DEAL TOO HAPPY TO CARE FOR UPPERCROSS, WHICH, AS YOU WELL KNOW,
AFFORDS LITTLE TO WRITE ABOUT.  WE HAVE HAD A VERY DULL CHRISTMAS; MR
AND MRS MUSGROVE HAVE NOT HAD ONE DINNER PARTY ALL THE HOLIDAYS.  I DO
NOT RECKON THE HAYTERS AS ANYBODY.  THE HOLIDAYS, HOWEVER, ARE OVER AT
LAST:  I BELIEVE NO CHILDREN EVER HAD SUCH LONG ONES.  I AM SURE I HAD
NOT.  THE HOUSE WAS CLEARED YESTERDAY, EXCEPT OF THE LITTLE HARVILLES;
BUT YOU WILL BE SURPRISED TO HEAR THEY HAVE NEVER GONE HOME.  MRS
HARVILLE MUST BE AN ODD MOTHER TO PART WITH THEM SO LONG.  I DO NOT
UNDERSTAND IT.  THEY ARE NOT AT ALL NICE CHILDREN, IN MY OPINION; BUT
MRS MUSGROVE SEEMS TO LIKE THEM QUITE AS WELL, IF NOT BETTER, THAN HER
GRANDCHILDREN.  WHAT DREADFUL WEATHER WE HAVE HAD!  IT MAY NOT BE FELT
IN BATH, WITH YOUR NICE PAVEMENTS; BUT IN THE COUNTRY IT IS OF SOME
CONSEQUENCE.  I HAVE NOT HAD A CREATURE CALL ON ME SINCE THE SECOND
WEEK IN JANUARY, EXCEPT CHARLES HAYTER, WHO HAD BEEN CALLING MUCH
OFTENER THAN WAS WELCOME.  BETWEEN OURSELVES, I THINK IT A GREAT PITY
HENRIETTA DID NOT REMAIN AT LYME AS LONG AS LOUISA; IT WOULD HAVE KEPT
HER A LITTLE OUT OF HIS WAY.  THE CARRIAGE IS GONE TO-DAY, TO BRING
LOUISA AND THE HARVILLES TO-MORROW.  WE ARE NOT ASKED TO DINE WITH
THEM, HOWEVER, TILL THE DAY AFTER, MRS MUSGROVE IS SO AFRAID OF HER
BEING FATIGUED BY THE JOURNEY, WHICH IS NOT VERY LIKELY, CONSIDERING
THE CARE THAT WILL BE TAKEN OF HER; AND IT WOULD BE MUCH MORE
CONVENIENT TO ME TO DINE THERE TO-MORROW.  I AM GLAD YOU FIND MR ELLIOT
SO AGREEABLE, AND WISH I COULD BE ACQUAINTED WITH HIM TOO; BUT I HAVE
MY USUAL LUCK:  I AM ALWAYS OUT OF THE WAY WHEN ANY THING DESIRABLE IS
GOING ON; ALWAYS THE LAST OF MY FAMILY TO BE NOTICED.  WHAT AN IMMENSE
TIME MRS CLAY HAS BEEN STAYING WITH ELIZABETH!  DOES SHE NEVER MEAN TO
GO AWAY?  BUT PERHAPS IF SHE WERE TO LEAVE THE ROOM VACANT, WE MIGHT
NOT BE INVITED.  LET ME KNOW WHAT YOU THINK OF THIS.  I DO NOT EXPECT
MY CHILDREN TO BE ASKED, YOU KNOW.  I CAN LEAVE THEM AT THE GREAT HOUSE
VERY WELL, FOR A MONTH OR SIX WEEKS.  I HAVE THIS MOMENT HEARD THAT THE
CROFTS ARE GOING TO BATH ALMOST IMMEDIATELY; THEY THINK THE ADMIRAL
GOUTY.  CHARLES HEARD IT QUITE BY CHANCE; THEY HAVE NOT HAD THE
CIVILITY TO GIVE ME ANY NOTICE, OR OF OFFERING TO TAKE ANYTHING.  I DO
NOT THINK THEY IMPROVE AT ALL AS NEIGHBOURS.  WE SEE NOTHING OF THEM,
AND THIS IS REALLY AN INSTANCE OF GROSS INATTENTION.  CHARLES JOINS ME
IN LOVE, AND EVERYTHING PROPER.  YOURS AFFECTIONATELY,

"MARY M---.

"I AM SORRY TO SAY THAT I AM VERY FAR FROM WELL; AND JEMIMA HAS JUST
TOLD ME THAT THE BUTCHER SAYS THERE IS A BAD SORE-THROAT VERY MUCH
ABOUT.  I DARE SAY I SHALL CATCH IT; AND MY SORE-THROATS, YOU KNOW, ARE
ALWAYS WORSE THAN ANYBODY'S."


SO ENDED THE FIRST PART, WHICH HAD BEEN AFTERWARDS PUT INTO AN
ENVELOPE, CONTAINING NEARLY AS MUCH MORE.


"I KEPT MY LETTER OPEN, THAT I MIGHT SEND YOU WORD HOW LOUISA BORE HER
JOURNEY, AND NOW I AM EXTREMELY GLAD I DID, HAVING A GREAT DEAL TO ADD.
IN THE FIRST PLACE, I HAD A NOTE FROM MRS CROFT YESTERDAY, OFFERING TO
CONVEY ANYTHING TO YOU; A VERY KIND, FRIENDLY NOTE INDEED, ADDRESSED TO
ME, JUST AS IT OUGHT; I SHALL THEREFORE BE ABLE TO MAKE MY LETTER AS
LONG AS I LIKE.  THE ADMIRAL DOES NOT SEEM VERY ILL, AND I SINCERELY
HOPE BATH WILL DO HIM ALL THE GOOD HE WANTS.  I SHALL BE TRULY GLAD TO
HAVE THEM BACK AGAIN.  OUR NEIGHBOURHOOD CANNOT SPARE SUCH A PLEASANT
FAMILY.  BUT NOW FOR LOUISA.  I HAVE SOMETHING TO COMMUNICATE THAT WILL
ASTONISH YOU NOT A LITTLE.  SHE AND THE HARVILLES CAME ON TUESDAY VERY
SAFELY, AND IN THE EVENING WE WENT TO ASK HER HOW SHE DID, WHEN WE WERE
RATHER SURPRISED NOT TO FIND CAPTAIN BENWICK OF THE PARTY, FOR HE HAD
BEEN INVITED AS WELL AS THE HARVILLES; AND WHAT DO YOU THINK WAS THE
REASON?  NEITHER MORE NOR LESS THAN HIS BEING IN LOVE WITH LOUISA, AND
NOT CHOOSING TO VENTURE TO UPPERCROSS TILL HE HAD HAD AN ANSWER FROM MR
MUSGROVE; FOR IT WAS ALL SETTLED BETWEEN HIM AND HER BEFORE SHE CAME
AWAY, AND HE HAD WRITTEN TO HER FATHER BY CAPTAIN HARVILLE.  TRUE, UPON
MY HONOUR!  ARE NOT YOU ASTONISHED?  I SHALL BE SURPRISED AT LEAST IF
YOU EVER RECEIVED A HINT OF IT, FOR I NEVER DID.  MRS MUSGROVE PROTESTS
SOLEMNLY THAT SHE KNEW NOTHING OF THE MATTER.  WE ARE ALL VERY WELL
PLEASED, HOWEVER, FOR THOUGH IT IS NOT EQUAL TO HER MARRYING CAPTAIN
WENTWORTH, IT IS INFINITELY BETTER THAN CHARLES HAYTER; AND MR MUSGROVE
HAS WRITTEN HIS CONSENT, AND CAPTAIN BENWICK IS EXPECTED TO-DAY.  MRS
HARVILLE SAYS HER HUSBAND FEELS A GOOD DEAL ON HIS POOR SISTER'S
ACCOUNT; BUT, HOWEVER, LOUISA IS A GREAT FAVOURITE WITH BOTH.  INDEED,
MRS HARVILLE AND I QUITE AGREE THAT WE LOVE HER THE BETTER FOR HAVING
NURSED HER.  CHARLES WONDERS WHAT CAPTAIN WENTWORTH WILL SAY; BUT IF
YOU REMEMBER, I NEVER THOUGHT HIM ATTACHED TO LOUISA; I NEVER COULD SEE
ANYTHING OF IT.  AND THIS IS THE END, YOU SEE, OF CAPTAIN BENWICK'S
BEING SUPPOSED TO BE AN ADMIRER OF YOURS.  HOW CHARLES COULD TAKE SUCH
A THING INTO HIS HEAD WAS ALWAYS INCOMPREHENSIBLE TO ME.  I HOPE HE
WILL BE MORE AGREEABLE NOW.  CERTAINLY NOT A GREAT MATCH FOR LOUISA
MUSGROVE, BUT A MILLION TIMES BETTER THAN MARRYING AMONG THE HAYTERS."


MARY NEED NOT HAVE FEARED HER SISTER'S BEING IN ANY DEGREE PREPARED FOR
THE NEWS.  SHE HAD NEVER IN HER LIFE BEEN MORE ASTONISHED.  CAPTAIN
BENWICK AND LOUISA MUSGROVE!  IT WAS ALMOST TOO WONDERFUL FOR BELIEF,
AND IT WAS WITH THE GREATEST EFFORT THAT SHE COULD REMAIN IN THE ROOM,
PRESERVE AN AIR OF CALMNESS, AND ANSWER THE COMMON QUESTIONS OF THE
MOMENT.  HAPPILY FOR HER, THEY WERE NOT MANY.  SIR WALTER WANTED TO
KNOW WHETHER THE CROFTS TRAVELLED WITH FOUR HORSES, AND WHETHER THEY
WERE LIKELY TO BE SITUATED IN SUCH A PART OF BATH AS IT MIGHT SUIT MISS
ELLIOT AND HIMSELF TO VISIT IN; BUT HAD LITTLE CURIOSITY BEYOND.

"HOW IS MARY?" SAID ELIZABETH; AND WITHOUT WAITING FOR AN ANSWER, "AND
PRAY WHAT BRINGS THE CROFTS TO BATH?"

"THEY COME ON THE ADMIRAL'S ACCOUNT.  HE IS THOUGHT TO BE GOUTY."

"GOUT AND DECREPITUDE!" SAID SIR WALTER.  "POOR OLD GENTLEMAN."

"HAVE THEY ANY ACQUAINTANCE HERE?" ASKED ELIZABETH.

"I DO NOT KNOW; BUT I CAN HARDLY SUPPOSE THAT, AT ADMIRAL CROFT'S TIME
OF LIFE, AND IN HIS PROFESSION, HE SHOULD NOT HAVE MANY ACQUAINTANCE IN
SUCH A PLACE AS THIS."

"I SUSPECT," SAID SIR WALTER COOLLY, "THAT ADMIRAL CROFT WILL BE BEST
KNOWN IN BATH AS THE RENTER OF KELLYNCH HALL.  ELIZABETH, MAY WE
VENTURE TO PRESENT HIM AND HIS WIFE IN LAURA PLACE?"

"OH, NO! I THINK NOT.  SITUATED AS WE ARE WITH LADY DALRYMPLE, COUSINS,
WE OUGHT TO BE VERY CAREFUL NOT TO EMBARRASS HER WITH ACQUAINTANCE SHE
MIGHT NOT APPROVE.  IF WE WERE NOT RELATED, IT WOULD NOT SIGNIFY; BUT
AS COUSINS, SHE WOULD FEEL SCRUPULOUS AS TO ANY PROPOSAL OF OURS.  WE
HAD BETTER LEAVE THE CROFTS TO FIND THEIR OWN LEVEL.  THERE ARE SEVERAL
ODD-LOOKING MEN WALKING ABOUT HERE, WHO, I AM TOLD, ARE SAILORS.  THE
CROFTS WILL ASSOCIATE WITH THEM."

THIS WAS SIR WALTER AND ELIZABETH'S SHARE OF INTEREST IN THE LETTER;
WHEN MRS CLAY HAD PAID HER TRIBUTE OF MORE DECENT ATTENTION, IN AN
ENQUIRY AFTER MRS CHARLES MUSGROVE, AND HER FINE LITTLE BOYS, ANNE WAS
AT LIBERTY.

IN HER OWN ROOM, SHE TRIED TO COMPREHEND IT.  WELL MIGHT CHARLES WONDER
HOW CAPTAIN WENTWORTH WOULD FEEL!  PERHAPS HE HAD QUITTED THE FIELD,
HAD GIVEN LOUISA UP, HAD CEASED TO LOVE, HAD FOUND HE DID NOT LOVE HER.
SHE COULD NOT ENDURE THE IDEA OF TREACHERY OR LEVITY, OR ANYTHING AKIN
TO ILL USAGE BETWEEN HIM AND HIS FRIEND.  SHE COULD NOT ENDURE THAT
SUCH A FRIENDSHIP AS THEIRS SHOULD BE SEVERED UNFAIRLY.

CAPTAIN BENWICK AND LOUISA MUSGROVE!  THE HIGH-SPIRITED, JOYOUS-TALKING
LOUISA MUSGROVE, AND THE DEJECTED, THINKING, FEELING, READING, CAPTAIN
BENWICK, SEEMED EACH OF THEM EVERYTHING THAT WOULD NOT SUIT THE OTHER.
THEIR MINDS MOST DISSIMILAR!  WHERE COULD HAVE BEEN THE ATTRACTION?
THE ANSWER SOON PRESENTED ITSELF.  IT HAD BEEN IN SITUATION.  THEY HAD
BEEN THROWN TOGETHER SEVERAL WEEKS; THEY HAD BEEN LIVING IN THE SAME
SMALL FAMILY PARTY:  SINCE HENRIETTA'S COMING AWAY, THEY MUST HAVE BEEN
DEPENDING ALMOST ENTIRELY ON EACH OTHER, AND LOUISA, JUST RECOVERING
FROM ILLNESS, HAD BEEN IN AN INTERESTING STATE, AND CAPTAIN BENWICK WAS
NOT INCONSOLABLE.  THAT WAS A POINT WHICH ANNE HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO
AVOID SUSPECTING BEFORE; AND INSTEAD OF DRAWING THE SAME CONCLUSION AS
MARY, FROM THE PRESENT COURSE OF EVENTS, THEY SERVED ONLY TO CONFIRM
THE IDEA OF HIS HAVING FELT SOME DAWNING OF TENDERNESS TOWARD HERSELF.
SHE DID NOT MEAN, HOWEVER, TO DERIVE MUCH MORE FROM IT TO GRATIFY HER
VANITY, THAN MARY MIGHT HAVE ALLOWED.  SHE WAS PERSUADED THAT ANY
TOLERABLY PLEASING YOUNG WOMAN WHO HAD LISTENED AND SEEMED TO FEEL FOR
HIM WOULD HAVE RECEIVED THE SAME COMPLIMENT.  HE HAD AN AFFECTIONATE
HEART.  HE MUST LOVE SOMEBODY.

SHE SAW NO REASON AGAINST THEIR BEING HAPPY.  LOUISA HAD FINE NAVAL
FERVOUR TO BEGIN WITH, AND THEY WOULD SOON GROW MORE ALIKE.  HE WOULD
GAIN CHEERFULNESS, AND SHE WOULD LEARN TO BE AN ENTHUSIAST FOR SCOTT
AND LORD BYRON; NAY, THAT WAS PROBABLY LEARNT ALREADY; OF COURSE THEY
HAD FALLEN IN LOVE OVER POETRY.  THE IDEA OF LOUISA MUSGROVE TURNED
INTO A PERSON OF LITERARY TASTE, AND SENTIMENTAL REFLECTION WAS
AMUSING, BUT SHE HAD NO DOUBT OF ITS BEING SO.  THE DAY AT LYME, THE
FALL FROM THE COBB, MIGHT INFLUENCE HER HEALTH, HER NERVES, HER
COURAGE, HER CHARACTER TO THE END OF HER LIFE, AS THOROUGHLY AS IT
APPEARED TO HAVE INFLUENCED HER FATE.

THE CONCLUSION OF THE WHOLE WAS, THAT IF THE WOMAN WHO HAD BEEN
SENSIBLE OF CAPTAIN WENTWORTH'S MERITS COULD BE ALLOWED TO PREFER
ANOTHER MAN, THERE WAS NOTHING IN THE ENGAGEMENT TO EXCITE LASTING
WONDER; AND IF CAPTAIN WENTWORTH LOST NO FRIEND BY IT, CERTAINLY
NOTHING TO BE REGRETTED.  NO, IT WAS NOT REGRET WHICH MADE ANNE'S HEART
BEAT IN SPITE OF HERSELF, AND BROUGHT THE COLOUR INTO HER CHEEKS WHEN
SHE THOUGHT OF CAPTAIN WENTWORTH UNSHACKLED AND FREE.  SHE HAD SOME
FEELINGS WHICH SHE WAS ASHAMED TO INVESTIGATE.  THEY WERE TOO MUCH LIKE
JOY, SENSELESS JOY!

SHE LONGED TO SEE THE CROFTS; BUT WHEN THE MEETING TOOK PLACE, IT WAS
EVIDENT THAT NO RUMOUR OF THE NEWS HAD YET REACHED THEM.  THE VISIT OF
CEREMONY WAS PAID AND RETURNED; AND LOUISA MUSGROVE WAS MENTIONED, AND
CAPTAIN BENWICK, TOO, WITHOUT EVEN HALF A SMILE.

THE CROFTS HAD PLACED THEMSELVES IN LODGINGS IN GAY STREET, PERFECTLY
TO SIR WALTER'S SATISFACTION.  HE WAS NOT AT ALL ASHAMED OF THE
ACQUAINTANCE, AND DID, IN FACT, THINK AND TALK A GREAT DEAL MORE ABOUT
THE ADMIRAL, THAN THE ADMIRAL EVER THOUGHT OR TALKED ABOUT HIM.

THE CROFTS KNEW QUITE AS MANY PEOPLE IN BATH AS THEY WISHED FOR, AND
CONSIDERED THEIR INTERCOURSE WITH THE ELLIOTS AS A MERE MATTER OF FORM,
AND NOT IN THE LEAST LIKELY TO AFFORD THEM ANY PLEASURE.  THEY BROUGHT
WITH THEM THEIR COUNTRY HABIT OF BEING ALMOST ALWAYS TOGETHER.  HE WAS
ORDERED TO WALK TO KEEP OFF THE GOUT, AND MRS CROFT SEEMED TO GO SHARES
WITH HIM IN EVERYTHING, AND TO WALK FOR HER LIFE TO DO HIM GOOD.  ANNE
SAW THEM WHEREVER SHE WENT.  LADY RUSSELL TOOK HER OUT IN HER CARRIAGE
ALMOST EVERY MORNING, AND SHE NEVER FAILED TO THINK OF THEM, AND NEVER
FAILED TO SEE THEM.  KNOWING THEIR FEELINGS AS SHE DID, IT WAS A MOST
ATTRACTIVE PICTURE OF HAPPINESS TO HER.  SHE ALWAYS WATCHED THEM AS
LONG AS SHE COULD, DELIGHTED TO FANCY SHE UNDERSTOOD WHAT THEY MIGHT BE
TALKING OF, AS THEY WALKED ALONG IN HAPPY INDEPENDENCE, OR EQUALLY
DELIGHTED TO SEE THE ADMIRAL'S HEARTY SHAKE OF THE HAND WHEN HE
ENCOUNTERED AN OLD FRIEND, AND OBSERVE THEIR EAGERNESS OF CONVERSATION
WHEN OCCASIONALLY FORMING INTO A LITTLE KNOT OF THE NAVY, MRS CROFT
LOOKING AS INTELLIGENT AND KEEN AS ANY OF THE OFFICERS AROUND HER.

ANNE WAS TOO MUCH ENGAGED WITH LADY RUSSELL TO BE OFTEN WALKING
HERSELF; BUT IT SO HAPPENED THAT ONE MORNING, ABOUT A WEEK OR TEN DAYS
AFTER THE CROFT'S ARRIVAL, IT SUITED HER BEST TO LEAVE HER FRIEND, OR
HER FRIEND'S CARRIAGE, IN THE LOWER PART OF THE TOWN, AND RETURN ALONE
TO CAMDEN PLACE, AND IN WALKING UP MILSOM STREET SHE HAD THE GOOD
FORTUNE TO MEET WITH THE ADMIRAL.  HE WAS STANDING BY HIMSELF AT A
PRINTSHOP WINDOW, WITH HIS HANDS BEHIND HIM, IN EARNEST CONTEMPLATION
OF SOME PRINT, AND SHE NOT ONLY MIGHT HAVE PASSED HIM UNSEEN, BUT WAS
OBLIGED TO TOUCH AS WELL AS ADDRESS HIM BEFORE SHE COULD CATCH HIS
NOTICE.  WHEN HE DID PERCEIVE AND ACKNOWLEDGE HER, HOWEVER, IT WAS DONE
WITH ALL HIS USUAL FRANKNESS AND GOOD HUMOUR.  "HA! IS IT YOU?  THANK
YOU, THANK YOU.  THIS IS TREATING ME LIKE A FRIEND.  HERE I AM, YOU
SEE, STARING AT A PICTURE.  I CAN NEVER GET BY THIS SHOP WITHOUT
STOPPING.  BUT WHAT A THING HERE IS, BY WAY OF A BOAT!  DO LOOK AT IT.
DID YOU EVER SEE THE LIKE?  WHAT QUEER FELLOWS YOUR FINE PAINTERS MUST
BE, TO THINK THAT ANYBODY WOULD VENTURE THEIR LIVES IN SUCH A SHAPELESS
OLD COCKLESHELL AS THAT?  AND YET HERE ARE TWO GENTLEMEN STUCK UP IN IT
MIGHTILY AT THEIR EASE, AND LOOKING ABOUT THEM AT THE ROCKS AND
MOUNTAINS, AS IF THEY WERE NOT TO BE UPSET THE NEXT MOMENT, WHICH THEY
CERTAINLY MUST BE.  I WONDER WHERE THAT BOAT WAS BUILT!" (LAUGHING
HEARTILY); "I WOULD NOT VENTURE OVER A HORSEPOND IN IT.  WELL,"
(TURNING AWAY), "NOW, WHERE ARE YOU BOUND?  CAN I GO ANYWHERE FOR YOU,
OR WITH YOU?  CAN I BE OF ANY USE?"

"NONE, I THANK YOU, UNLESS YOU WILL GIVE ME THE PLEASURE OF YOUR
COMPANY THE LITTLE WAY OUR ROAD LIES TOGETHER.  I AM GOING HOME."


"THAT I WILL, WITH ALL MY HEART, AND FARTHER, TOO.  YES, YES WE WILL
HAVE A SNUG WALK TOGETHER, AND I HAVE SOMETHING TO TELL YOU AS WE GO
ALONG.  THERE, TAKE MY ARM; THAT'S RIGHT; I DO NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE IF
I HAVE NOT A WOMAN THERE.  LORD! WHAT A BOAT IT IS!" TAKING A LAST LOOK
AT THE PICTURE, AS THEY BEGAN TO BE IN MOTION.

"DID YOU SAY THAT YOU HAD SOMETHING TO TELL ME, SIR?"

"YES, I HAVE, PRESENTLY.  BUT HERE COMES A FRIEND, CAPTAIN BRIGDEN; I
SHALL ONLY SAY, 'HOW D'YE DO?' AS WE PASS, HOWEVER.  I SHALL NOT STOP.
'HOW D'YE DO?'  BRIGDEN STARES TO SEE ANYBODY WITH ME BUT MY WIFE.
SHE, POOR SOUL, IS TIED BY THE LEG.  SHE HAS A BLISTER ON ONE OF HER
HEELS, AS LARGE AS A THREE-SHILLING PIECE.  IF YOU LOOK ACROSS THE
STREET, YOU WILL SEE ADMIRAL BRAND COMING DOWN AND HIS BROTHER.  SHABBY
FELLOWS, BOTH OF THEM!  I AM GLAD THEY ARE NOT ON THIS SIDE OF THE WAY.
SOPHY CANNOT BEAR THEM.  THEY PLAYED ME A PITIFUL TRICK ONCE: GOT AWAY
WITH SOME OF MY BEST MEN.  I WILL TELL YOU THE WHOLE STORY ANOTHER
TIME.  THERE COMES OLD SIR ARCHIBALD DREW AND HIS GRANDSON.  LOOK, HE
SEES US; HE KISSES HIS HAND TO YOU; HE TAKES YOU FOR MY WIFE.  AH! THE
PEACE HAS COME TOO SOON FOR THAT YOUNKER.  POOR OLD SIR ARCHIBALD!  HOW
DO YOU LIKE BATH, MISS ELLIOT?  IT SUITS US VERY WELL.  WE ARE ALWAYS
MEETING WITH SOME OLD FRIEND OR OTHER; THE STREETS FULL OF THEM EVERY
MORNING; SURE TO HAVE PLENTY OF CHAT; AND THEN WE GET AWAY FROM THEM
ALL, AND SHUT OURSELVES IN OUR LODGINGS, AND DRAW IN OUR CHAIRS, AND
ARE SNUG AS IF WE WERE AT KELLYNCH, AY, OR AS WE USED TO BE EVEN AT
NORTH YARMOUTH AND DEAL.  WE DO NOT LIKE OUR LODGINGS HERE THE WORSE, I
CAN TELL YOU, FOR PUTTING US IN MIND OF THOSE WE FIRST HAD AT NORTH
YARMOUTH.  THE WIND BLOWS THROUGH ONE OF THE CUPBOARDS JUST IN THE SAME
WAY."

WHEN THEY WERE GOT A LITTLE FARTHER, ANNE VENTURED TO PRESS AGAIN FOR
WHAT HE HAD TO COMMUNICATE.  SHE HOPED WHEN CLEAR OF MILSOM STREET TO
HAVE HER CURIOSITY GRATIFIED; BUT SHE WAS STILL OBLIGED TO WAIT, FOR
THE ADMIRAL HAD MADE UP HIS MIND NOT TO BEGIN TILL THEY HAD GAINED THE
GREATER SPACE AND QUIET OF BELMONT; AND AS SHE WAS NOT REALLY MRS
CROFT, SHE MUST LET HIM HAVE HIS OWN WAY.  AS SOON AS THEY WERE FAIRLY
ASCENDING BELMONT, HE BEGAN--

"WELL, NOW YOU SHALL HEAR SOMETHING THAT WILL SURPRISE YOU.  BUT FIRST
OF ALL, YOU MUST TELL ME THE NAME OF THE YOUNG LADY I AM GOING TO TALK
ABOUT.  THAT YOUNG LADY, YOU KNOW, THAT WE HAVE ALL BEEN SO CONCERNED
FOR.  THE MISS MUSGROVE, THAT ALL THIS HAS BEEN HAPPENING TO.  HER
CHRISTIAN NAME:  I ALWAYS FORGET HER CHRISTIAN NAME."

ANNE HAD BEEN ASHAMED TO APPEAR TO COMPREHEND SO SOON AS SHE REALLY
DID; BUT NOW SHE COULD SAFELY SUGGEST THE NAME OF "LOUISA."

"AY, AY, MISS LOUISA MUSGROVE, THAT IS THE NAME.  I WISH YOUNG LADIES
HAD NOT SUCH A NUMBER OF FINE CHRISTIAN NAMES.  I SHOULD NEVER BE OUT
IF THEY WERE ALL SOPHYS, OR SOMETHING OF THAT SORT.  WELL, THIS MISS
LOUISA, WE ALL THOUGHT, YOU KNOW, WAS TO MARRY FREDERICK.  HE WAS
COURTING HER WEEK AFTER WEEK.  THE ONLY WONDER WAS, WHAT THEY COULD BE
WAITING FOR, TILL THE BUSINESS AT LYME CAME; THEN, INDEED, IT WAS CLEAR
ENOUGH THAT THEY MUST WAIT TILL HER BRAIN WAS SET TO RIGHT.  BUT EVEN
THEN THERE WAS SOMETHING ODD IN THEIR WAY OF GOING ON.  INSTEAD OF
STAYING AT LYME, HE WENT OFF TO PLYMOUTH, AND THEN HE WENT OFF TO SEE
EDWARD.  WHEN WE CAME BACK FROM MINEHEAD HE WAS GONE DOWN TO EDWARD'S,
AND THERE HE HAS BEEN EVER SINCE.  WE HAVE SEEN NOTHING OF HIM SINCE
NOVEMBER.  EVEN SOPHY COULD NOT UNDERSTAND IT.  BUT NOW, THE MATTER HAS
TAKEN THE STRANGEST TURN OF ALL; FOR THIS YOUNG LADY, THE SAME MISS
MUSGROVE, INSTEAD OF BEING TO MARRY FREDERICK, IS TO MARRY JAMES
BENWICK.  YOU KNOW JAMES BENWICK."

"A LITTLE.  I AM A LITTLE ACQUAINTED WITH CAPTAIN BENWICK."

"WELL, SHE IS TO MARRY HIM.  NAY, MOST LIKELY THEY ARE MARRIED ALREADY,
FOR I DO NOT KNOW WHAT THEY SHOULD WAIT FOR."

"I THOUGHT CAPTAIN BENWICK A VERY PLEASING YOUNG MAN," SAID ANNE, "AND
I UNDERSTAND THAT HE BEARS AN EXCELLENT CHARACTER."

"OH! YES, YES, THERE IS NOT A WORD TO BE SAID AGAINST JAMES BENWICK.
HE IS ONLY A COMMANDER, IT IS TRUE, MADE LAST SUMMER, AND THESE ARE BAD
TIMES FOR GETTING ON, BUT HE HAS NOT ANOTHER FAULT THAT I KNOW OF.  AN
EXCELLENT, GOOD-HEARTED FELLOW, I ASSURE YOU; A VERY ACTIVE, ZEALOUS
OFFICER TOO, WHICH IS MORE THAN YOU WOULD THINK FOR, PERHAPS, FOR THAT
SOFT SORT OF MANNER DOES NOT DO HIM JUSTICE."

"INDEED YOU ARE MISTAKEN THERE, SIR; I SHOULD NEVER AUGUR WANT OF
SPIRIT FROM CAPTAIN BENWICK'S MANNERS.  I THOUGHT THEM PARTICULARLY
PLEASING, AND I WILL ANSWER FOR IT, THEY WOULD GENERALLY PLEASE."

"WELL, WELL, LADIES ARE THE BEST JUDGES; BUT JAMES BENWICK IS RATHER
TOO PIANO FOR ME; AND THOUGH VERY LIKELY IT IS ALL OUR PARTIALITY,
SOPHY AND I CANNOT HELP THINKING FREDERICK'S MANNERS BETTER THAN HIS.
THERE IS SOMETHING ABOUT FREDERICK MORE TO OUR TASTE."

ANNE WAS CAUGHT.  SHE HAD ONLY MEANT TO OPPOSE THE TOO COMMON IDEA OF
SPIRIT AND GENTLENESS BEING INCOMPATIBLE WITH EACH OTHER, NOT AT ALL TO
REPRESENT CAPTAIN BENWICK'S MANNERS AS THE VERY BEST THAT COULD
POSSIBLY BE; AND, AFTER A LITTLE HESITATION, SHE WAS BEGINNING TO SAY,
"I WAS NOT ENTERING INTO ANY COMPARISON OF THE TWO FRIENDS," BUT THE
ADMIRAL INTERRUPTED HER WITH--

"AND THE THING IS CERTAINLY TRUE.  IT IS NOT A MERE BIT OF GOSSIP.  WE
HAVE IT FROM FREDERICK HIMSELF.  HIS SISTER HAD A LETTER FROM HIM
YESTERDAY, IN WHICH HE TELLS US OF IT, AND HE HAD JUST HAD IT IN A
LETTER FROM HARVILLE, WRITTEN UPON THE SPOT, FROM UPPERCROSS.  I FANCY
THEY ARE ALL AT UPPERCROSS."

THIS WAS AN OPPORTUNITY WHICH ANNE COULD NOT RESIST; SHE SAID,
THEREFORE, "I HOPE, ADMIRAL, I HOPE THERE IS NOTHING IN THE STYLE OF
CAPTAIN WENTWORTH'S LETTER TO MAKE YOU AND MRS CROFT PARTICULARLY
UNEASY.  IT DID SEEM, LAST AUTUMN, AS IF THERE WERE AN ATTACHMENT
BETWEEN HIM AND LOUISA MUSGROVE; BUT I HOPE IT MAY BE UNDERSTOOD TO
HAVE WORN OUT ON EACH SIDE EQUALLY, AND WITHOUT VIOLENCE.  I HOPE HIS
LETTER DOES NOT BREATHE THE SPIRIT OF AN ILL-USED MAN."

"NOT AT ALL, NOT AT ALL; THERE IS NOT AN OATH OR A MURMUR FROM
BEGINNING TO END."

ANNE LOOKED DOWN TO HIDE HER SMILE.

"NO, NO; FREDERICK IS NOT A MAN TO WHINE AND COMPLAIN; HE HAS TOO MUCH
SPIRIT FOR THAT.  IF THE GIRL LIKES ANOTHER MAN BETTER, IT IS VERY FIT
SHE SHOULD HAVE HIM."

"CERTAINLY.  BUT WHAT I MEAN IS, THAT I HOPE THERE IS NOTHING IN
CAPTAIN WENTWORTH'S MANNER OF WRITING TO MAKE YOU SUPPOSE HE THINKS
HIMSELF ILL-USED BY HIS FRIEND, WHICH MIGHT APPEAR, YOU KNOW, WITHOUT
ITS BEING ABSOLUTELY SAID.  I SHOULD BE VERY SORRY THAT SUCH A
FRIENDSHIP AS HAS SUBSISTED BETWEEN HIM AND CAPTAIN BENWICK SHOULD BE
DESTROYED, OR EVEN WOUNDED, BY A CIRCUMSTANCE OF THIS SORT."

"YES, YES, I UNDERSTAND YOU.  BUT THERE IS NOTHING AT ALL OF THAT
NATURE IN THE LETTER.  HE DOES NOT GIVE THE LEAST FLING AT BENWICK;
DOES NOT SO MUCH AS SAY, 'I WONDER AT IT, I HAVE A REASON OF MY OWN FOR
WONDERING AT IT.'  NO, YOU WOULD NOT GUESS, FROM HIS WAY OF WRITING,
THAT HE HAD EVER THOUGHT OF THIS MISS (WHAT'S HER NAME?) FOR HIMSELF.
HE VERY HANDSOMELY HOPES THEY WILL BE HAPPY TOGETHER; AND THERE IS
NOTHING VERY UNFORGIVING IN THAT, I THINK."

ANNE DID NOT RECEIVE THE PERFECT CONVICTION WHICH THE ADMIRAL MEANT TO
CONVEY, BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN USELESS TO PRESS THE ENQUIRY FARTHER.
SHE THEREFORE SATISFIED HERSELF WITH COMMON-PLACE REMARKS OR QUIET
ATTENTION, AND THE ADMIRAL HAD IT ALL HIS OWN WAY.

"POOR FREDERICK!" SAID HE AT LAST.  "NOW HE MUST BEGIN ALL OVER AGAIN
WITH SOMEBODY ELSE.  I THINK WE MUST GET HIM TO BATH.  SOPHY MUST
WRITE, AND BEG HIM TO COME TO BATH.  HERE ARE PRETTY GIRLS ENOUGH, I AM
SURE.  IT WOULD BE OF NO USE TO GO TO UPPERCROSS AGAIN, FOR THAT OTHER
MISS MUSGROVE, I FIND, IS BESPOKE BY HER COUSIN, THE YOUNG PARSON.  DO
NOT YOU THINK, MISS ELLIOT, WE HAD BETTER TRY TO GET HIM TO BATH?"



CHAPTER 19


WHILE ADMIRAL CROFT WAS TAKING THIS WALK WITH ANNE, AND EXPRESSING HIS
WISH OF GETTING CAPTAIN WENTWORTH TO BATH, CAPTAIN WENTWORTH WAS
ALREADY ON HIS WAY THITHER.  BEFORE MRS CROFT HAD WRITTEN, HE WAS
ARRIVED, AND THE VERY NEXT TIME ANNE WALKED OUT, SHE SAW HIM.

MR ELLIOT WAS ATTENDING HIS TWO COUSINS AND MRS CLAY.  THEY WERE IN
MILSOM STREET.  IT BEGAN TO RAIN, NOT MUCH, BUT ENOUGH TO MAKE SHELTER
DESIRABLE FOR WOMEN, AND QUITE ENOUGH TO MAKE IT VERY DESIRABLE FOR
MISS ELLIOT TO HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF BEING CONVEYED HOME IN LADY
DALRYMPLE'S CARRIAGE, WHICH WAS SEEN WAITING AT A LITTLE DISTANCE; SHE,
ANNE, AND MRS CLAY, THEREFORE, TURNED INTO MOLLAND'S, WHILE MR ELLIOT
STEPPED TO LADY DALRYMPLE, TO REQUEST HER ASSISTANCE.  HE SOON JOINED
THEM AGAIN, SUCCESSFUL, OF COURSE; LADY DALRYMPLE WOULD BE MOST HAPPY
TO TAKE THEM HOME, AND WOULD CALL FOR THEM IN A FEW MINUTES.

HER LADYSHIP'S CARRIAGE WAS A BAROUCHE, AND DID NOT HOLD MORE THAN FOUR
WITH ANY COMFORT.  MISS CARTERET WAS WITH HER MOTHER; CONSEQUENTLY IT
WAS NOT REASONABLE TO EXPECT ACCOMMODATION FOR ALL THE THREE CAMDEN
PLACE LADIES.  THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT AS TO MISS ELLIOT.  WHOEVER
SUFFERED INCONVENIENCE, SHE MUST SUFFER NONE, BUT IT OCCUPIED A LITTLE
TIME TO SETTLE THE POINT OF CIVILITY BETWEEN THE OTHER TWO.  THE RAIN
WAS A MERE TRIFLE, AND ANNE WAS MOST SINCERE IN PREFERRING A WALK WITH
MR ELLIOT.  BUT THE RAIN WAS ALSO A MERE TRIFLE TO MRS CLAY; SHE WOULD
HARDLY ALLOW IT EVEN TO DROP AT ALL, AND HER BOOTS WERE SO THICK! MUCH
THICKER THAN MISS ANNE'S; AND, IN SHORT, HER CIVILITY RENDERED HER
QUITE AS ANXIOUS TO BE LEFT TO WALK WITH MR ELLIOT AS ANNE COULD BE,
AND IT WAS DISCUSSED BETWEEN THEM WITH A GENEROSITY SO POLITE AND SO
DETERMINED, THAT THE OTHERS WERE OBLIGED TO SETTLE IT FOR THEM; MISS
ELLIOT MAINTAINING THAT MRS CLAY HAD A LITTLE COLD ALREADY, AND MR
ELLIOT DECIDING ON APPEAL, THAT HIS COUSIN ANNE'S BOOTS WERE RATHER THE
THICKEST.

IT WAS FIXED ACCORDINGLY, THAT MRS CLAY SHOULD BE OF THE PARTY IN THE
CARRIAGE; AND THEY HAD JUST REACHED THIS POINT, WHEN ANNE, AS SHE SAT
NEAR THE WINDOW, DESCRIED, MOST DECIDEDLY AND DISTINCTLY, CAPTAIN
WENTWORTH WALKING DOWN THE STREET.

HER START WAS PERCEPTIBLE ONLY TO HERSELF; BUT SHE INSTANTLY FELT THAT
SHE WAS THE GREATEST SIMPLETON IN THE WORLD, THE MOST UNACCOUNTABLE AND
ABSURD!  FOR A FEW MINUTES SHE SAW NOTHING BEFORE HER; IT WAS ALL
CONFUSION.  SHE WAS LOST, AND WHEN SHE HAD SCOLDED BACK HER SENSES, SHE
FOUND THE OTHERS STILL WAITING FOR THE CARRIAGE, AND MR ELLIOT (ALWAYS
OBLIGING) JUST SETTING OFF FOR UNION STREET ON A COMMISSION OF MRS
CLAY'S.

SHE NOW FELT A GREAT INCLINATION TO GO TO THE OUTER DOOR; SHE WANTED TO
SEE IF IT RAINED.  WHY WAS SHE TO SUSPECT HERSELF OF ANOTHER MOTIVE?
CAPTAIN WENTWORTH MUST BE OUT OF SIGHT.  SHE LEFT HER SEAT, SHE WOULD
GO; ONE HALF OF HER SHOULD NOT BE ALWAYS SO MUCH WISER THAN THE OTHER
HALF, OR ALWAYS SUSPECTING THE OTHER OF BEING WORSE THAN IT WAS.  SHE
WOULD SEE IF IT RAINED.  SHE WAS SENT BACK, HOWEVER, IN A MOMENT BY THE
ENTRANCE OF CAPTAIN WENTWORTH HIMSELF, AMONG A PARTY OF GENTLEMEN AND
LADIES, EVIDENTLY HIS ACQUAINTANCE, AND WHOM HE MUST HAVE JOINED A
LITTLE BELOW MILSOM STREET.  HE WAS MORE OBVIOUSLY STRUCK AND CONFUSED
BY THE SIGHT OF HER THAN SHE HAD EVER OBSERVED BEFORE; HE LOOKED QUITE
RED.  FOR THE FIRST TIME, SINCE THEIR RENEWED ACQUAINTANCE, SHE FELT
THAT SHE WAS BETRAYING THE LEAST SENSIBILITY OF THE TWO.  SHE HAD THE
ADVANTAGE OF HIM IN THE PREPARATION OF THE LAST FEW MOMENTS.  ALL THE
OVERPOWERING, BLINDING, BEWILDERING, FIRST EFFECTS OF STRONG SURPRISE
WERE OVER WITH HER.  STILL, HOWEVER, SHE HAD ENOUGH TO FEEL!  IT WAS
AGITATION, PAIN, PLEASURE, A SOMETHING BETWEEN DELIGHT AND MISERY.

HE SPOKE TO HER, AND THEN TURNED AWAY.  THE CHARACTER OF HIS MANNER WAS
EMBARRASSMENT.  SHE COULD NOT HAVE CALLED IT EITHER COLD OR FRIENDLY,
OR ANYTHING SO CERTAINLY AS EMBARRASSED.

AFTER A SHORT INTERVAL, HOWEVER, HE CAME TOWARDS HER, AND SPOKE AGAIN.
MUTUAL ENQUIRIES ON COMMON SUBJECTS PASSED:  NEITHER OF THEM, PROBABLY,
MUCH THE WISER FOR WHAT THEY HEARD, AND ANNE CONTINUING FULLY SENSIBLE
OF HIS BEING LESS AT EASE THAN FORMERLY.  THEY HAD BY DINT OF BEING SO
VERY MUCH TOGETHER, GOT TO SPEAK TO EACH OTHER WITH A CONSIDERABLE
PORTION OF APPARENT INDIFFERENCE AND CALMNESS; BUT HE COULD NOT DO IT
NOW.  TIME HAD CHANGED HIM, OR LOUISA HAD CHANGED HIM.  THERE WAS
CONSCIOUSNESS OF SOME SORT OR OTHER.  HE LOOKED VERY WELL, NOT AS IF HE
HAD BEEN SUFFERING IN HEALTH OR SPIRITS, AND HE TALKED OF UPPERCROSS,
OF THE MUSGROVES, NAY, EVEN OF LOUISA, AND HAD EVEN A MOMENTARY LOOK OF
HIS OWN ARCH SIGNIFICANCE AS HE NAMED HER; BUT YET IT WAS CAPTAIN
WENTWORTH NOT COMFORTABLE, NOT EASY, NOT ABLE TO FEIGN THAT HE WAS.

IT DID NOT SURPRISE, BUT IT GRIEVED ANNE TO OBSERVE THAT ELIZABETH
WOULD NOT KNOW HIM.  SHE SAW THAT HE SAW ELIZABETH, THAT ELIZABETH SAW
HIM, THAT THERE WAS COMPLETE INTERNAL RECOGNITION ON EACH SIDE; SHE WAS
CONVINCED THAT HE WAS READY TO BE ACKNOWLEDGED AS AN ACQUAINTANCE,
EXPECTING IT, AND SHE HAD THE PAIN OF SEEING HER SISTER TURN AWAY WITH
UNALTERABLE COLDNESS.

LADY DALRYMPLE'S CARRIAGE, FOR WHICH MISS ELLIOT WAS GROWING VERY
IMPATIENT, NOW DREW UP; THE SERVANT CAME IN TO ANNOUNCE IT.  IT WAS
BEGINNING TO RAIN AGAIN, AND ALTOGETHER THERE WAS A DELAY, AND A
BUSTLE, AND A TALKING, WHICH MUST MAKE ALL THE LITTLE CROWD IN THE SHOP
UNDERSTAND THAT LADY DALRYMPLE WAS CALLING TO CONVEY MISS ELLIOT.  AT
LAST MISS ELLIOT AND HER FRIEND, UNATTENDED BUT BY THE SERVANT, (FOR
THERE WAS NO COUSIN RETURNED), WERE WALKING OFF; AND CAPTAIN WENTWORTH,
WATCHING THEM, TURNED AGAIN TO ANNE, AND BY MANNER, RATHER THAN WORDS,
WAS OFFERING HIS SERVICES TO HER.

"I AM MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU," WAS HER ANSWER, "BUT I AM NOT GOING WITH
THEM.  THE CARRIAGE WOULD NOT ACCOMMODATE SO MANY.  I WALK:  I PREFER
WALKING."

"BUT IT RAINS."

"OH! VERY LITTLE,  NOTHING THAT I REGARD."

AFTER A MOMENT'S PAUSE HE SAID:  "THOUGH I CAME ONLY YESTERDAY, I HAVE
EQUIPPED MYSELF PROPERLY FOR BATH ALREADY, YOU SEE," (POINTING TO A NEW
UMBRELLA); "I WISH YOU WOULD MAKE USE OF IT, IF YOU ARE DETERMINED TO
WALK; THOUGH I THINK IT WOULD BE MORE PRUDENT TO LET ME GET YOU A
CHAIR."

SHE WAS VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO HIM, BUT DECLINED IT ALL, REPEATING HER
CONVICTION, THAT THE RAIN WOULD COME TO NOTHING AT PRESENT, AND ADDING,
"I AM ONLY WAITING FOR MR ELLIOT.  HE WILL BE HERE IN A MOMENT, I AM
SURE."

SHE HAD HARDLY SPOKEN THE WORDS WHEN MR ELLIOT WALKED IN.  CAPTAIN
WENTWORTH RECOLLECTED HIM PERFECTLY.  THERE WAS NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
HIM AND THE MAN WHO HAD STOOD ON THE STEPS AT LYME, ADMIRING ANNE AS
SHE PASSED, EXCEPT IN THE AIR AND LOOK AND MANNER OF THE PRIVILEGED
RELATION AND FRIEND.  HE CAME IN WITH EAGERNESS, APPEARED TO SEE AND
THINK ONLY OF HER, APOLOGISED FOR HIS STAY, WAS GRIEVED TO HAVE KEPT
HER WAITING, AND ANXIOUS TO GET HER AWAY WITHOUT FURTHER LOSS OF TIME
AND BEFORE THE RAIN INCREASED; AND IN ANOTHER MOMENT THEY WALKED OFF
TOGETHER, HER ARM UNDER HIS, A GENTLE AND EMBARRASSED GLANCE, AND A
"GOOD MORNING TO YOU!" BEING ALL THAT SHE HAD TIME FOR, AS SHE PASSED
AWAY.

AS SOON AS THEY WERE OUT OF SIGHT, THE LADIES OF CAPTAIN WENTWORTH'S
PARTY BEGAN TALKING OF THEM.

"MR ELLIOT DOES NOT DISLIKE HIS COUSIN, I FANCY?"

"OH! NO, THAT IS CLEAR ENOUGH.  ONE CAN GUESS WHAT WILL HAPPEN THERE.
HE IS ALWAYS WITH THEM; HALF LIVES IN THE FAMILY, I BELIEVE.  WHAT A
VERY GOOD-LOOKING MAN!"

"YES, AND MISS ATKINSON, WHO DINED WITH HIM ONCE AT THE WALLISES, SAYS
HE IS THE MOST AGREEABLE MAN SHE EVER WAS IN COMPANY WITH."

"SHE IS PRETTY, I THINK; ANNE ELLIOT; VERY PRETTY, WHEN ONE COMES TO
LOOK AT HER.  IT IS NOT THE FASHION TO SAY SO, BUT I CONFESS I ADMIRE
HER MORE THAN HER SISTER."

"OH! SO DO I."

"AND SO DO I.  NO COMPARISON.  BUT THE MEN ARE ALL WILD AFTER MISS
ELLIOT.  ANNE IS TOO DELICATE FOR THEM."

ANNE WOULD HAVE BEEN PARTICULARLY OBLIGED TO HER COUSIN, IF HE WOULD
HAVE WALKED BY HER SIDE ALL THE WAY TO CAMDEN PLACE, WITHOUT SAYING A
WORD.  SHE HAD NEVER FOUND IT SO DIFFICULT TO LISTEN TO HIM, THOUGH
NOTHING COULD EXCEED HIS SOLICITUDE AND CARE, AND THOUGH HIS SUBJECTS
WERE PRINCIPALLY SUCH AS WERE WONT TO BE ALWAYS INTERESTING: PRAISE,
WARM, JUST, AND DISCRIMINATING, OF LADY RUSSELL, AND INSINUATIONS
HIGHLY RATIONAL AGAINST MRS CLAY.  BUT JUST NOW SHE COULD THINK ONLY OF
CAPTAIN WENTWORTH.  SHE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND HIS PRESENT FEELINGS,
WHETHER HE WERE REALLY SUFFERING MUCH FROM DISAPPOINTMENT OR NOT; AND
TILL THAT POINT WERE SETTLED, SHE COULD NOT BE QUITE HERSELF.

SHE HOPED TO BE WISE AND REASONABLE IN TIME; BUT ALAS! ALAS!  SHE MUST
CONFESS TO HERSELF THAT SHE WAS NOT WISE YET.

ANOTHER CIRCUMSTANCE VERY ESSENTIAL FOR HER TO KNOW, WAS HOW LONG HE
MEANT TO BE IN BATH; HE HAD NOT MENTIONED IT, OR SHE COULD NOT
RECOLLECT IT.  HE MIGHT BE ONLY PASSING THROUGH.  BUT IT WAS MORE
PROBABLE THAT HE SHOULD BE COME TO STAY.  IN THAT CASE, SO LIABLE AS
EVERY BODY WAS TO MEET EVERY BODY IN BATH, LADY RUSSELL WOULD IN ALL
LIKELIHOOD SEE HIM SOMEWHERE.  WOULD SHE RECOLLECT HIM?  HOW WOULD IT
ALL BE?

SHE HAD ALREADY BEEN OBLIGED TO TELL LADY RUSSELL THAT LOUISA MUSGROVE
WAS TO MARRY CAPTAIN BENWICK.  IT HAD COST HER SOMETHING TO ENCOUNTER
LADY RUSSELL'S SURPRISE; AND NOW, IF SHE WERE BY ANY CHANCE TO BE
THROWN INTO COMPANY WITH CAPTAIN WENTWORTH, HER IMPERFECT KNOWLEDGE OF
THE MATTER MIGHT ADD ANOTHER SHADE OF PREJUDICE AGAINST HIM.

THE FOLLOWING MORNING ANNE WAS OUT WITH HER FRIEND, AND FOR THE FIRST
HOUR, IN AN INCESSANT AND FEARFUL SORT OF WATCH FOR HIM IN VAIN; BUT AT
LAST, IN RETURNING DOWN PULTENEY STREET, SHE DISTINGUISHED HIM ON THE
RIGHT HAND PAVEMENT AT SUCH A DISTANCE AS TO HAVE HIM IN VIEW THE
GREATER PART OF THE STREET.  THERE WERE MANY OTHER MEN ABOUT HIM, MANY
GROUPS WALKING THE SAME WAY, BUT THERE WAS NO MISTAKING HIM.  SHE
LOOKED INSTINCTIVELY AT LADY RUSSELL; BUT NOT FROM ANY MAD IDEA OF HER
RECOGNISING HIM SO SOON AS SHE DID HERSELF.  NO, IT WAS NOT TO BE
SUPPOSED THAT LADY RUSSELL WOULD PERCEIVE HIM TILL THEY WERE NEARLY
OPPOSITE.  SHE LOOKED AT HER HOWEVER, FROM TIME TO TIME, ANXIOUSLY; AND
WHEN THE MOMENT APPROACHED WHICH MUST POINT HIM OUT, THOUGH NOT DARING
TO LOOK AGAIN (FOR HER OWN COUNTENANCE SHE KNEW WAS UNFIT TO BE SEEN),
SHE WAS YET PERFECTLY CONSCIOUS OF LADY RUSSELL'S EYES BEING TURNED
EXACTLY IN THE DIRECTION FOR HIM--OF HER BEING, IN SHORT, INTENTLY
OBSERVING HIM.  SHE COULD THOROUGHLY COMPREHEND THE SORT OF FASCINATION
HE MUST POSSESS OVER LADY RUSSELL'S MIND, THE DIFFICULTY IT MUST BE FOR
HER TO WITHDRAW HER EYES, THE ASTONISHMENT SHE MUST BE FEELING THAT
EIGHT OR NINE YEARS SHOULD HAVE PASSED OVER HIM, AND IN FOREIGN CLIMES
AND IN ACTIVE SERVICE TOO, WITHOUT ROBBING HIM OF ONE PERSONAL GRACE!

AT LAST, LADY RUSSELL DREW BACK HER HEAD.  "NOW, HOW WOULD SHE SPEAK OF
HIM?"

"YOU WILL WONDER," SAID SHE, "WHAT HAS BEEN FIXING MY EYE SO LONG; BUT
I WAS LOOKING AFTER SOME WINDOW-CURTAINS, WHICH LADY ALICIA AND MRS
FRANKLAND WERE TELLING ME OF LAST NIGHT.  THEY DESCRIBED THE
DRAWING-ROOM WINDOW-CURTAINS OF ONE OF THE HOUSES ON THIS SIDE OF THE
WAY, AND THIS PART OF THE STREET, AS BEING THE HANDSOMEST AND BEST HUNG
OF ANY IN BATH, BUT COULD NOT RECOLLECT THE EXACT NUMBER, AND I HAVE
BEEN TRYING TO FIND OUT WHICH IT COULD BE; BUT I CONFESS I CAN SEE NO
CURTAINS HEREABOUTS THAT ANSWER THEIR DESCRIPTION."

ANNE SIGHED AND BLUSHED AND SMILED, IN PITY AND DISDAIN, EITHER AT HER
FRIEND OR HERSELF.  THE PART WHICH PROVOKED HER MOST, WAS THAT IN ALL
THIS WASTE OF FORESIGHT AND CAUTION, SHE SHOULD HAVE LOST THE RIGHT
MOMENT FOR SEEING WHETHER HE SAW THEM.

A DAY OR TWO PASSED WITHOUT PRODUCING ANYTHING.  THE THEATRE OR THE
ROOMS, WHERE HE WAS MOST LIKELY TO BE, WERE NOT FASHIONABLE ENOUGH FOR
THE ELLIOTS, WHOSE EVENING AMUSEMENTS WERE SOLELY IN THE ELEGANT
STUPIDITY OF PRIVATE PARTIES, IN WHICH THEY WERE GETTING MORE AND MORE
ENGAGED; AND ANNE, WEARIED OF SUCH A STATE OF STAGNATION, SICK OF
KNOWING NOTHING, AND FANCYING HERSELF STRONGER BECAUSE HER STRENGTH WAS
NOT TRIED, WAS QUITE IMPATIENT FOR THE CONCERT EVENING.  IT WAS A
CONCERT FOR THE BENEFIT OF A PERSON PATRONISED BY LADY DALRYMPLE.  OF
COURSE THEY MUST ATTEND.  IT WAS REALLY EXPECTED TO BE A GOOD ONE, AND
CAPTAIN WENTWORTH WAS VERY FOND OF MUSIC.  IF SHE COULD ONLY HAVE A FEW
MINUTES CONVERSATION WITH HIM AGAIN, SHE FANCIED SHE SHOULD BE
SATISFIED; AND AS TO THE POWER OF ADDRESSING HIM, SHE FELT ALL OVER
COURAGE IF THE OPPORTUNITY OCCURRED.  ELIZABETH HAD TURNED FROM HIM,
LADY RUSSELL OVERLOOKED HIM; HER NERVES WERE STRENGTHENED BY THESE
CIRCUMSTANCES; SHE FELT THAT SHE OWED HIM ATTENTION.

SHE HAD ONCE PARTLY PROMISED MRS SMITH TO SPEND THE EVENING WITH HER;
BUT IN A SHORT HURRIED CALL SHE EXCUSED HERSELF AND PUT IT OFF, WITH
THE MORE DECIDED PROMISE OF A LONGER VISIT ON THE MORROW.  MRS SMITH
GAVE A MOST GOOD-HUMOURED ACQUIESCENCE.

"BY ALL MEANS," SAID SHE; "ONLY TELL ME ALL ABOUT IT, WHEN YOU DO COME.
WHO IS YOUR PARTY?"

ANNE NAMED THEM ALL.  MRS SMITH MADE NO REPLY; BUT WHEN SHE WAS LEAVING
HER SAID, AND WITH AN EXPRESSION HALF SERIOUS, HALF ARCH, "WELL, I
HEARTILY WISH YOUR CONCERT MAY ANSWER; AND DO NOT FAIL ME TO-MORROW IF
YOU CAN COME; FOR I BEGIN TO HAVE A FOREBODING THAT I MAY NOT HAVE MANY
MORE VISITS FROM YOU."

ANNE WAS STARTLED AND CONFUSED; BUT AFTER STANDING IN A MOMENT'S
SUSPENSE, WAS OBLIGED, AND NOT SORRY TO BE OBLIGED, TO HURRY AWAY.



CHAPTER 20


SIR WALTER, HIS TWO DAUGHTERS, AND MRS CLAY, WERE THE EARLIEST OF ALL
THEIR PARTY AT THE ROOMS IN THE EVENING; AND AS LADY DALRYMPLE MUST BE
WAITED FOR, THEY TOOK THEIR STATION BY ONE OF THE FIRES IN THE OCTAGON
ROOM.  BUT HARDLY WERE THEY SO SETTLED, WHEN THE DOOR OPENED AGAIN, AND
CAPTAIN WENTWORTH WALKED IN ALONE.  ANNE WAS THE NEAREST TO HIM, AND
MAKING YET A LITTLE ADVANCE, SHE INSTANTLY SPOKE.  HE WAS PREPARING
ONLY TO BOW AND PASS ON, BUT HER GENTLE "HOW DO YOU DO?" BROUGHT HIM
OUT OF THE STRAIGHT LINE TO STAND NEAR HER, AND MAKE ENQUIRIES IN
RETURN, IN SPITE OF THE FORMIDABLE FATHER AND SISTER IN THE BACK
GROUND.  THEIR BEING IN THE BACK GROUND WAS A SUPPORT TO ANNE; SHE KNEW
NOTHING OF THEIR LOOKS, AND FELT EQUAL TO EVERYTHING WHICH SHE BELIEVED
RIGHT TO BE DONE.

WHILE THEY WERE SPEAKING, A WHISPERING BETWEEN HER FATHER AND ELIZABETH
CAUGHT HER EAR.  SHE COULD NOT DISTINGUISH, BUT SHE MUST GUESS THE
SUBJECT; AND ON CAPTAIN WENTWORTH'S MAKING A DISTANT BOW, SHE
COMPREHENDED THAT HER FATHER HAD JUDGED SO WELL AS TO GIVE HIM THAT
SIMPLE ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF ACQUAINTANCE, AND SHE WAS JUST IN TIME BY A
SIDE GLANCE TO SEE A SLIGHT CURTSEY FROM ELIZABETH HERSELF.  THIS,
THOUGH LATE, AND RELUCTANT, AND UNGRACIOUS, WAS YET BETTER THAN
NOTHING, AND HER SPIRITS IMPROVED.

AFTER TALKING, HOWEVER, OF THE WEATHER, AND BATH, AND THE CONCERT,
THEIR CONVERSATION BEGAN TO FLAG, AND SO LITTLE WAS SAID AT LAST, THAT
SHE WAS EXPECTING HIM TO GO EVERY MOMENT, BUT HE DID NOT; HE SEEMED IN
NO HURRY TO LEAVE HER; AND PRESENTLY WITH RENEWED SPIRIT, WITH A LITTLE
SMILE, A LITTLE GLOW, HE SAID--

"I HAVE HARDLY SEEN YOU SINCE OUR DAY AT LYME.  I AM AFRAID YOU MUST
HAVE SUFFERED FROM THE SHOCK, AND THE MORE FROM ITS NOT OVERPOWERING
YOU AT THE TIME."

SHE ASSURED HIM THAT SHE HAD NOT.

"IT WAS A FRIGHTFUL HOUR," SAID HE, "A FRIGHTFUL DAY!" AND HE PASSED
HIS HAND ACROSS HIS EYES, AS IF THE REMEMBRANCE WERE STILL TOO PAINFUL,
BUT IN A MOMENT, HALF SMILING AGAIN, ADDED, "THE DAY HAS PRODUCED SOME
EFFECTS HOWEVER; HAS HAD SOME CONSEQUENCES WHICH MUST BE CONSIDERED AS
THE VERY REVERSE OF FRIGHTFUL.  WHEN YOU HAD THE PRESENCE OF MIND TO
SUGGEST THAT BENWICK WOULD BE THE PROPEREST PERSON TO FETCH A SURGEON,
YOU COULD HAVE LITTLE IDEA OF HIS BEING EVENTUALLY ONE OF THOSE MOST
CONCERNED IN HER RECOVERY."

"CERTAINLY I COULD HAVE NONE.  BUT IT APPEARS--I SHOULD HOPE IT WOULD
BE A VERY HAPPY MATCH.  THERE ARE ON BOTH SIDES GOOD PRINCIPLES AND
GOOD TEMPER."

"YES," SAID HE, LOOKING NOT EXACTLY FORWARD; "BUT THERE, I THINK, ENDS
THE RESEMBLANCE.  WITH ALL MY SOUL I WISH THEM HAPPY, AND REJOICE OVER
EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE IN FAVOUR OF IT.  THEY HAVE NO DIFFICULTIES TO
CONTEND WITH AT HOME, NO OPPOSITION, NO CAPRICE, NO DELAYS.  THE
MUSGROVES ARE BEHAVING LIKE THEMSELVES, MOST HONOURABLY AND KINDLY,
ONLY ANXIOUS WITH TRUE PARENTAL HEARTS TO PROMOTE THEIR DAUGHTER'S
COMFORT.  ALL THIS IS MUCH, VERY MUCH IN FAVOUR OF THEIR HAPPINESS;
MORE THAN PERHAPS--"

HE STOPPED.  A SUDDEN RECOLLECTION SEEMED TO OCCUR, AND TO GIVE HIM
SOME TASTE OF THAT EMOTION WHICH WAS REDDENING ANNE'S CHEEKS AND FIXING
HER EYES ON THE GROUND.  AFTER CLEARING HIS THROAT, HOWEVER, HE
PROCEEDED THUS--

"I CONFESS THAT I DO THINK THERE IS A DISPARITY, TOO GREAT A DISPARITY,
AND IN A POINT NO LESS ESSENTIAL THAN MIND.  I REGARD LOUISA MUSGROVE
AS A VERY AMIABLE, SWEET-TEMPERED GIRL, AND NOT DEFICIENT IN
UNDERSTANDING, BUT BENWICK IS SOMETHING MORE.  HE IS A CLEVER MAN, A
READING MAN; AND I CONFESS, THAT I DO CONSIDER HIS ATTACHING HIMSELF TO
HER WITH SOME SURPRISE.  HAD IT BEEN THE EFFECT OF GRATITUDE, HAD HE
LEARNT TO LOVE HER, BECAUSE HE BELIEVED HER TO BE PREFERRING HIM, IT
WOULD HAVE BEEN ANOTHER THING.  BUT I HAVE NO REASON TO SUPPOSE IT SO.
IT SEEMS, ON THE CONTRARY, TO HAVE BEEN A PERFECTLY SPONTANEOUS,
UNTAUGHT FEELING ON HIS SIDE, AND THIS SURPRISES ME.  A MAN LIKE HIM,
IN HIS SITUATION! WITH A HEART PIERCED, WOUNDED, ALMOST BROKEN!  FANNY
HARVILLE WAS A VERY SUPERIOR CREATURE, AND HIS ATTACHMENT TO HER WAS
INDEED ATTACHMENT.  A MAN DOES NOT RECOVER FROM SUCH A DEVOTION OF THE
HEART TO SUCH A WOMAN.  HE OUGHT NOT; HE DOES NOT."

EITHER FROM THE CONSCIOUSNESS, HOWEVER, THAT HIS FRIEND HAD RECOVERED,
OR FROM OTHER CONSCIOUSNESS, HE WENT NO FARTHER; AND ANNE WHO, IN SPITE
OF THE AGITATED VOICE IN WHICH THE LATTER PART HAD BEEN UTTERED, AND IN
SPITE OF ALL THE VARIOUS NOISES OF THE ROOM, THE ALMOST CEASELESS SLAM
OF THE DOOR, AND CEASELESS BUZZ OF PERSONS WALKING THROUGH, HAD
DISTINGUISHED EVERY WORD, WAS STRUCK, GRATIFIED, CONFUSED, AND
BEGINNING TO BREATHE VERY QUICK, AND FEEL AN HUNDRED THINGS IN A
MOMENT.  IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HER TO ENTER ON SUCH A SUBJECT; AND YET,
AFTER A PAUSE, FEELING THE NECESSITY OF SPEAKING, AND HAVING NOT THE
SMALLEST WISH FOR A TOTAL CHANGE, SHE ONLY DEVIATED SO FAR AS TO SAY--

"YOU WERE A GOOD WHILE AT LYME, I THINK?"

"ABOUT A FORTNIGHT.  I COULD NOT LEAVE IT TILL LOUISA'S DOING WELL WAS
QUITE ASCERTAINED.  I HAD BEEN TOO DEEPLY CONCERNED IN THE MISCHIEF TO
BE SOON AT PEACE.  IT HAD BEEN MY DOING, SOLELY MINE.  SHE WOULD NOT
HAVE BEEN OBSTINATE IF I HAD NOT BEEN WEAK.  THE COUNTRY ROUND LYME IS
VERY FINE.  I WALKED AND RODE A GREAT DEAL; AND THE MORE I SAW, THE
MORE I FOUND TO ADMIRE."

"I SHOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO SEE LYME AGAIN," SAID ANNE.

"INDEED!  I SHOULD NOT HAVE SUPPOSED THAT YOU COULD HAVE FOUND ANYTHING
IN LYME TO INSPIRE SUCH A FEELING.  THE HORROR AND DISTRESS YOU WERE
INVOLVED IN, THE STRETCH OF MIND, THE WEAR OF SPIRITS!  I SHOULD HAVE
THOUGHT YOUR LAST IMPRESSIONS OF LYME MUST HAVE BEEN STRONG DISGUST."

"THE LAST HOURS WERE CERTAINLY VERY PAINFUL," REPLIED ANNE; "BUT WHEN
PAIN IS OVER, THE REMEMBRANCE OF IT OFTEN BECOMES A PLEASURE.  ONE DOES
NOT LOVE A PLACE THE LESS FOR HAVING SUFFERED IN IT, UNLESS IT HAS BEEN
ALL SUFFERING, NOTHING BUT SUFFERING, WHICH WAS BY NO MEANS THE CASE AT
LYME.  WE WERE ONLY IN ANXIETY AND DISTRESS DURING THE LAST TWO HOURS,
AND PREVIOUSLY THERE HAD BEEN A GREAT DEAL OF ENJOYMENT.  SO MUCH
NOVELTY AND BEAUTY! I HAVE TRAVELLED SO LITTLE, THAT EVERY FRESH PLACE
WOULD BE INTERESTING TO ME; BUT THERE IS REAL BEAUTY AT LYME; AND IN
SHORT" (WITH A FAINT BLUSH AT SOME RECOLLECTIONS), "ALTOGETHER MY
IMPRESSIONS OF THE PLACE ARE VERY AGREEABLE."

AS SHE CEASED, THE ENTRANCE DOOR OPENED AGAIN, AND THE VERY PARTY
APPEARED FOR WHOM THEY WERE WAITING.  "LADY DALRYMPLE, LADY DALRYMPLE,"
WAS THE REJOICING SOUND; AND WITH ALL THE EAGERNESS COMPATIBLE WITH
ANXIOUS ELEGANCE, SIR WALTER AND HIS TWO LADIES STEPPED FORWARD TO MEET
HER.  LADY DALRYMPLE AND MISS CARTERET, ESCORTED BY MR ELLIOT AND
COLONEL WALLIS, WHO HAD HAPPENED TO ARRIVE NEARLY AT THE SAME INSTANT,
ADVANCED INTO THE ROOM.  THE OTHERS JOINED THEM, AND IT WAS A GROUP IN
WHICH ANNE FOUND HERSELF ALSO NECESSARILY INCLUDED.  SHE WAS DIVIDED
FROM CAPTAIN WENTWORTH.  THEIR INTERESTING, ALMOST TOO INTERESTING
CONVERSATION MUST BE BROKEN UP FOR A TIME, BUT SLIGHT WAS THE PENANCE
COMPARED WITH THE HAPPINESS WHICH BROUGHT IT ON!  SHE HAD LEARNT, IN
THE LAST TEN MINUTES, MORE OF HIS FEELINGS TOWARDS LOUISA, MORE OF ALL
HIS FEELINGS THAN SHE DARED TO THINK OF; AND SHE GAVE HERSELF UP TO THE
DEMANDS OF THE PARTY, TO THE NEEDFUL CIVILITIES OF THE MOMENT, WITH
EXQUISITE, THOUGH AGITATED SENSATIONS.  SHE WAS IN GOOD HUMOUR WITH
ALL.  SHE HAD RECEIVED IDEAS WHICH DISPOSED HER TO BE COURTEOUS AND
KIND TO ALL, AND TO PITY EVERY ONE, AS BEING LESS HAPPY THAN HERSELF.

THE DELIGHTFUL EMOTIONS WERE A LITTLE SUBDUED, WHEN ON STEPPING BACK
FROM THE GROUP, TO BE JOINED AGAIN BY CAPTAIN WENTWORTH, SHE SAW THAT
HE WAS GONE.  SHE WAS JUST IN TIME TO SEE HIM TURN INTO THE CONCERT
ROOM.  HE WAS GONE; HE HAD DISAPPEARED, SHE FELT A MOMENT'S REGRET.
BUT "THEY SHOULD MEET AGAIN.  HE WOULD LOOK FOR HER, HE WOULD FIND HER
OUT BEFORE THE EVENING WERE OVER, AND AT PRESENT, PERHAPS, IT WAS AS
WELL TO BE ASUNDER.  SHE WAS IN NEED OF A LITTLE INTERVAL FOR
RECOLLECTION."

UPON LADY RUSSELL'S APPEARANCE SOON AFTERWARDS, THE WHOLE PARTY WAS
COLLECTED, AND ALL THAT REMAINED WAS TO MARSHAL THEMSELVES, AND PROCEED
INTO THE CONCERT ROOM; AND BE OF ALL THE CONSEQUENCE IN THEIR POWER,
DRAW AS MANY EYES, EXCITE AS MANY WHISPERS, AND DISTURB AS MANY PEOPLE
AS THEY COULD.

VERY, VERY HAPPY WERE BOTH ELIZABETH AND ANNE ELLIOT AS THEY WALKED IN.
ELIZABETH ARM IN ARM WITH MISS CARTERET, AND LOOKING ON THE BROAD BACK
OF THE DOWAGER VISCOUNTESS DALRYMPLE BEFORE HER, HAD NOTHING TO WISH
FOR WHICH DID NOT SEEM WITHIN HER REACH; AND ANNE--BUT IT WOULD BE AN
INSULT TO THE NATURE OF ANNE'S FELICITY, TO DRAW ANY COMPARISON BETWEEN
IT AND HER SISTER'S; THE ORIGIN OF ONE ALL SELFISH VANITY, OF THE OTHER
ALL GENEROUS ATTACHMENT.

ANNE SAW NOTHING, THOUGHT NOTHING OF THE BRILLIANCY OF THE ROOM.  HER
HAPPINESS WAS FROM WITHIN.  HER EYES WERE BRIGHT AND HER CHEEKS GLOWED;
BUT SHE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT IT.  SHE WAS THINKING ONLY OF THE LAST HALF
HOUR, AND AS THEY PASSED TO THEIR SEATS, HER MIND TOOK A HASTY RANGE
OVER IT.  HIS CHOICE OF SUBJECTS, HIS EXPRESSIONS, AND STILL MORE HIS
MANNER AND LOOK, HAD BEEN SUCH AS SHE COULD SEE IN ONLY ONE LIGHT.  HIS
OPINION OF LOUISA MUSGROVE'S INFERIORITY, AN OPINION WHICH HE HAD
SEEMED SOLICITOUS TO GIVE, HIS WONDER AT CAPTAIN BENWICK, HIS FEELINGS
AS TO A FIRST, STRONG ATTACHMENT; SENTENCES BEGUN WHICH HE COULD NOT
FINISH, HIS HALF AVERTED EYES AND MORE THAN HALF EXPRESSIVE GLANCE,
ALL, ALL DECLARED THAT HE HAD A HEART RETURNING TO HER AT LEAST; THAT
ANGER, RESENTMENT, AVOIDANCE, WERE NO MORE; AND THAT THEY WERE
SUCCEEDED, NOT MERELY BY FRIENDSHIP AND REGARD, BUT BY THE TENDERNESS
OF THE PAST.  YES, SOME SHARE OF THE TENDERNESS OF THE PAST.  SHE COULD
NOT CONTEMPLATE THE CHANGE AS IMPLYING LESS.  HE MUST LOVE HER.

THESE WERE THOUGHTS, WITH THEIR ATTENDANT VISIONS, WHICH OCCUPIED AND
FLURRIED HER TOO MUCH TO LEAVE HER ANY POWER OF OBSERVATION; AND SHE
PASSED ALONG THE ROOM WITHOUT HAVING A GLIMPSE OF HIM, WITHOUT EVEN
TRYING TO DISCERN HIM.  WHEN THEIR PLACES WERE DETERMINED ON, AND THEY
WERE ALL PROPERLY ARRANGED, SHE LOOKED ROUND TO SEE IF HE SHOULD HAPPEN
TO BE IN THE SAME PART OF THE ROOM, BUT HE WAS NOT; HER EYE COULD NOT
REACH HIM; AND THE CONCERT BEING JUST OPENING, SHE MUST CONSENT FOR A
TIME TO BE HAPPY IN A HUMBLER WAY.

THE PARTY WAS DIVIDED AND DISPOSED OF ON TWO CONTIGUOUS BENCHES: ANNE
WAS AMONG THOSE ON THE FOREMOST, AND MR ELLIOT HAD MANOEUVRED SO WELL,
WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF HIS FRIEND COLONEL WALLIS, AS TO HAVE A SEAT BY
HER.  MISS ELLIOT, SURROUNDED BY HER COUSINS, AND THE PRINCIPAL OBJECT
OF COLONEL WALLIS'S GALLANTRY, WAS QUITE CONTENTED.

ANNE'S MIND WAS IN A MOST FAVOURABLE STATE FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT OF THE
EVENING; IT WAS JUST OCCUPATION ENOUGH:  SHE HAD FEELINGS FOR THE
TENDER, SPIRITS FOR THE GAY, ATTENTION FOR THE SCIENTIFIC, AND PATIENCE
FOR THE WEARISOME; AND HAD NEVER LIKED A CONCERT BETTER, AT LEAST
DURING THE FIRST ACT.  TOWARDS THE CLOSE OF IT, IN THE INTERVAL
SUCCEEDING AN ITALIAN SONG, SHE EXPLAINED THE WORDS OF THE SONG TO MR
ELLIOT.  THEY HAD A CONCERT BILL BETWEEN THEM.

"THIS," SAID SHE, "IS NEARLY THE SENSE, OR RATHER THE MEANING OF THE
WORDS, FOR CERTAINLY THE SENSE OF AN ITALIAN LOVE-SONG MUST NOT BE
TALKED OF, BUT IT IS AS NEARLY THE MEANING AS I CAN GIVE; FOR I DO NOT
PRETEND TO UNDERSTAND THE LANGUAGE.  I AM A VERY POOR ITALIAN SCHOLAR."

"YES, YES, I SEE YOU ARE.  I SEE YOU KNOW NOTHING OF THE MATTER.  YOU
HAVE ONLY KNOWLEDGE ENOUGH OF THE LANGUAGE TO TRANSLATE AT SIGHT THESE
INVERTED, TRANSPOSED, CURTAILED ITALIAN LINES, INTO CLEAR,
COMPREHENSIBLE, ELEGANT ENGLISH.  YOU NEED NOT SAY ANYTHING MORE OF
YOUR IGNORANCE.  HERE IS COMPLETE PROOF."

"I WILL NOT OPPOSE SUCH KIND POLITENESS; BUT I SHOULD BE SORRY TO BE
EXAMINED BY A REAL PROFICIENT."

"I HAVE NOT HAD THE PLEASURE OF VISITING IN CAMDEN PLACE SO LONG,"
REPLIED HE, "WITHOUT KNOWING SOMETHING OF MISS ANNE ELLIOT; AND I DO
REGARD HER AS ONE WHO IS TOO MODEST FOR THE WORLD IN GENERAL TO BE
AWARE OF HALF HER ACCOMPLISHMENTS, AND TOO HIGHLY ACCOMPLISHED FOR
MODESTY TO BE NATURAL IN ANY OTHER WOMAN."

"FOR SHAME! FOR SHAME! THIS IS TOO MUCH FLATTERY.  I FORGET WHAT WE ARE
TO HAVE NEXT," TURNING TO THE BILL.

"PERHAPS," SAID MR ELLIOT, SPEAKING LOW, "I HAVE HAD A LONGER
ACQUAINTANCE WITH YOUR CHARACTER THAN YOU ARE AWARE OF."

"INDEED!  HOW SO?  YOU CAN HAVE BEEN ACQUAINTED WITH IT ONLY SINCE I
CAME TO BATH, EXCEPTING AS YOU MIGHT HEAR ME PREVIOUSLY SPOKEN OF IN MY
OWN FAMILY."

"I KNEW YOU BY REPORT LONG BEFORE YOU CAME TO BATH.  I HAD HEARD YOU
DESCRIBED BY THOSE WHO KNEW YOU INTIMATELY.  I HAVE BEEN ACQUAINTED
WITH YOU BY CHARACTER MANY YEARS.  YOUR PERSON, YOUR DISPOSITION,
ACCOMPLISHMENTS, MANNER; THEY WERE ALL PRESENT TO ME."

MR ELLIOT WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED IN THE INTEREST HE HOPED TO RAISE.  NO
ONE CAN WITHSTAND THE CHARM OF SUCH A MYSTERY.  TO HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED
LONG AGO TO A RECENT ACQUAINTANCE, BY NAMELESS PEOPLE, IS IRRESISTIBLE;
AND ANNE WAS ALL CURIOSITY.  SHE WONDERED, AND QUESTIONED HIM EAGERLY;
BUT IN VAIN.  HE DELIGHTED IN BEING ASKED, BUT HE WOULD NOT TELL.

"NO, NO, SOME TIME OR OTHER, PERHAPS, BUT NOT NOW.  HE WOULD MENTION NO
NAMES NOW; BUT SUCH, HE COULD ASSURE HER, HAD BEEN THE FACT.  HE HAD
MANY YEARS AGO RECEIVED SUCH A DESCRIPTION OF MISS ANNE ELLIOT AS HAD
INSPIRED HIM WITH THE HIGHEST IDEA OF HER MERIT, AND EXCITED THE
WARMEST CURIOSITY TO KNOW HER."

ANNE COULD THINK OF NO ONE SO LIKELY TO HAVE SPOKEN WITH PARTIALITY OF
HER MANY YEARS AGO AS THE MR WENTWORTH OF MONKFORD, CAPTAIN WENTWORTH'S
BROTHER.  HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN MR ELLIOT'S COMPANY, BUT SHE HAD NOT
COURAGE TO ASK THE QUESTION.

"THE NAME OF ANNE ELLIOT," SAID HE, "HAS LONG HAD AN INTERESTING SOUND
TO ME.  VERY LONG HAS IT POSSESSED A CHARM OVER MY FANCY; AND, IF I
DARED, I WOULD BREATHE MY WISHES THAT THE NAME MIGHT NEVER CHANGE."

SUCH, SHE BELIEVED, WERE HIS WORDS; BUT SCARCELY HAD SHE RECEIVED THEIR
SOUND, THAN HER ATTENTION WAS CAUGHT BY OTHER SOUNDS IMMEDIATELY BEHIND
HER, WHICH RENDERED EVERY THING ELSE TRIVIAL.  HER FATHER AND LADY
DALRYMPLE WERE SPEAKING.

"A WELL-LOOKING MAN," SAID SIR WALTER, "A VERY WELL-LOOKING MAN."

"A VERY FINE YOUNG MAN INDEED!" SAID LADY DALRYMPLE.  "MORE AIR THAN
ONE OFTEN SEES IN BATH.  IRISH, I DARE SAY."

"NO, I JUST KNOW HIS NAME.  A BOWING ACQUAINTANCE.  WENTWORTH; CAPTAIN
WENTWORTH OF THE NAVY.  HIS SISTER MARRIED MY TENANT IN SOMERSETSHIRE,
THE CROFT, WHO RENTS KELLYNCH."

BEFORE SIR WALTER HAD REACHED THIS POINT, ANNE'S EYES HAD CAUGHT THE
RIGHT DIRECTION, AND DISTINGUISHED CAPTAIN WENTWORTH STANDING AMONG A
CLUSTER OF MEN AT A LITTLE DISTANCE.  AS HER EYES FELL ON HIM, HIS
SEEMED TO BE WITHDRAWN FROM HER.  IT HAD THAT APPEARANCE.  IT SEEMED AS
IF SHE HAD BEEN ONE MOMENT TOO LATE; AND AS LONG AS SHE DARED OBSERVE,
HE DID NOT LOOK AGAIN:  BUT THE PERFORMANCE WAS RECOMMENCING, AND SHE
WAS FORCED TO SEEM TO RESTORE HER ATTENTION TO THE ORCHESTRA AND LOOK
STRAIGHT FORWARD.

WHEN SHE COULD GIVE ANOTHER GLANCE, HE HAD MOVED AWAY.  HE COULD NOT
HAVE COME NEARER TO HER IF HE WOULD; SHE WAS SO SURROUNDED AND SHUT IN:
BUT SHE WOULD RATHER HAVE CAUGHT HIS EYE.

MR ELLIOT'S SPEECH, TOO, DISTRESSED HER.  SHE HAD NO LONGER ANY
INCLINATION TO TALK TO HIM.  SHE WISHED HIM NOT SO NEAR HER.

THE FIRST ACT WAS OVER.  NOW SHE HOPED FOR SOME BENEFICIAL CHANGE; AND,
AFTER A PERIOD OF NOTHING-SAYING AMONGST THE PARTY, SOME OF THEM DID
DECIDE ON GOING IN QUEST OF TEA.  ANNE WAS ONE OF THE FEW WHO DID NOT
CHOOSE TO MOVE.  SHE REMAINED IN HER SEAT, AND SO DID LADY RUSSELL; BUT
SHE HAD THE PLEASURE OF GETTING RID OF MR ELLIOT; AND SHE DID NOT MEAN,
WHATEVER SHE MIGHT FEEL ON LADY RUSSELL'S ACCOUNT, TO SHRINK FROM
CONVERSATION WITH CAPTAIN WENTWORTH, IF HE GAVE HER THE OPPORTUNITY.
SHE WAS PERSUADED BY LADY RUSSELL'S COUNTENANCE THAT SHE HAD SEEN HIM.

HE DID NOT COME HOWEVER.  ANNE SOMETIMES FANCIED SHE DISCERNED HIM AT A
DISTANCE, BUT HE NEVER CAME.  THE ANXIOUS INTERVAL WORE AWAY
UNPRODUCTIVELY.  THE OTHERS RETURNED, THE ROOM FILLED AGAIN, BENCHES
WERE RECLAIMED AND REPOSSESSED, AND ANOTHER HOUR OF PLEASURE OR OF
PENANCE WAS TO BE SAT OUT, ANOTHER HOUR OF MUSIC WAS TO GIVE DELIGHT OR
THE GAPES, AS REAL OR AFFECTED TASTE FOR IT PREVAILED.  TO ANNE, IT
CHIEFLY WORE THE PROSPECT OF AN HOUR OF AGITATION.  SHE COULD NOT QUIT
THAT ROOM IN PEACE WITHOUT SEEING CAPTAIN WENTWORTH ONCE MORE, WITHOUT
THE INTERCHANGE OF ONE FRIENDLY LOOK.

IN RE-SETTLING THEMSELVES THERE WERE NOW MANY CHANGES, THE RESULT OF
WHICH WAS FAVOURABLE FOR HER.  COLONEL WALLIS DECLINED SITTING DOWN
AGAIN, AND MR ELLIOT WAS INVITED BY ELIZABETH AND MISS CARTERET, IN A
MANNER NOT TO BE REFUSED, TO SIT BETWEEN THEM; AND BY SOME OTHER
REMOVALS, AND A LITTLE SCHEMING OF HER OWN,  ANNE WAS ENABLED TO PLACE
HERSELF MUCH NEARER THE END OF THE BENCH THAN SHE HAD BEEN BEFORE, MUCH
MORE WITHIN REACH OF A PASSER-BY.  SHE COULD NOT DO SO, WITHOUT
COMPARING HERSELF WITH MISS LAROLLES, THE INIMITABLE MISS LAROLLES; BUT
STILL SHE DID IT, AND NOT WITH MUCH HAPPIER EFFECT; THOUGH BY WHAT
SEEMED PROSPERITY IN THE SHAPE OF AN EARLY ABDICATION IN HER NEXT
NEIGHBOURS, SHE FOUND HERSELF AT THE VERY END OF THE BENCH BEFORE THE
CONCERT CLOSED.

SUCH WAS HER SITUATION, WITH A VACANT SPACE AT HAND, WHEN CAPTAIN
WENTWORTH WAS AGAIN IN SIGHT.  SHE SAW HIM NOT FAR OFF.  HE SAW HER
TOO; YET HE LOOKED GRAVE, AND SEEMED IRRESOLUTE, AND ONLY BY VERY SLOW
DEGREES CAME AT LAST NEAR ENOUGH TO SPEAK TO HER.  SHE FELT THAT
SOMETHING MUST BE THE MATTER.  THE CHANGE WAS INDUBITABLE.  THE
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HIS PRESENT AIR AND WHAT IT HAD BEEN IN THE OCTAGON
ROOM WAS STRIKINGLY GREAT.  WHY WAS IT?  SHE THOUGHT OF HER FATHER, OF
LADY RUSSELL.  COULD THERE HAVE BEEN ANY UNPLEASANT GLANCES?  HE BEGAN
BY SPEAKING OF THE CONCERT GRAVELY, MORE LIKE THE CAPTAIN WENTWORTH OF
UPPERCROSS; OWNED HIMSELF DISAPPOINTED, HAD EXPECTED SINGING; AND IN
SHORT, MUST CONFESS THAT HE SHOULD NOT BE SORRY WHEN IT WAS OVER.  ANNE
REPLIED, AND SPOKE IN DEFENCE OF THE PERFORMANCE SO WELL, AND YET IN
ALLOWANCE FOR HIS FEELINGS SO PLEASANTLY, THAT HIS COUNTENANCE
IMPROVED, AND HE REPLIED AGAIN WITH ALMOST A SMILE.  THEY TALKED FOR A
FEW MINUTES MORE; THE IMPROVEMENT HELD; HE EVEN LOOKED DOWN TOWARDS THE
BENCH, AS IF HE SAW A PLACE ON IT WELL WORTH OCCUPYING; WHEN AT THAT
MOMENT A TOUCH ON HER SHOULDER OBLIGED ANNE TO TURN ROUND.  IT CAME
FROM MR ELLIOT.  HE BEGGED HER PARDON, BUT SHE MUST BE APPLIED TO, TO
EXPLAIN ITALIAN AGAIN.  MISS CARTERET WAS VERY ANXIOUS TO HAVE A
GENERAL IDEA OF WHAT WAS NEXT TO BE SUNG.  ANNE COULD NOT REFUSE; BUT
NEVER HAD SHE SACRIFICED TO POLITENESS WITH A MORE SUFFERING SPIRIT.

A FEW MINUTES, THOUGH AS FEW AS POSSIBLE, WERE INEVITABLY CONSUMED; AND
WHEN HER OWN MISTRESS AGAIN, WHEN ABLE TO TURN AND LOOK AS SHE HAD DONE
BEFORE, SHE FOUND HERSELF ACCOSTED BY CAPTAIN WENTWORTH, IN A RESERVED
YET HURRIED SORT OF FAREWELL.  "HE MUST WISH HER GOOD NIGHT; HE WAS
GOING; HE SHOULD GET HOME AS FAST AS HE COULD."

"IS NOT THIS SONG WORTH STAYING FOR?" SAID ANNE, SUDDENLY STRUCK BY AN
IDEA WHICH MADE HER YET MORE ANXIOUS TO BE ENCOURAGING.

"NO!" HE REPLIED IMPRESSIVELY, "THERE IS NOTHING WORTH MY STAYING FOR;"
AND HE WAS GONE DIRECTLY.

JEALOUSY OF MR ELLIOT!  IT WAS THE ONLY INTELLIGIBLE MOTIVE.  CAPTAIN
WENTWORTH JEALOUS OF HER AFFECTION!  COULD SHE HAVE BELIEVED IT A WEEK
AGO; THREE HOURS AGO!  FOR A MOMENT THE GRATIFICATION WAS EXQUISITE.
BUT, ALAS! THERE WERE VERY DIFFERENT THOUGHTS TO SUCCEED.  HOW WAS SUCH
JEALOUSY TO BE QUIETED?  HOW WAS THE TRUTH TO REACH HIM?  HOW, IN ALL
THE PECULIAR DISADVANTAGES OF THEIR RESPECTIVE SITUATIONS, WOULD HE
EVER LEARN OF HER REAL SENTIMENTS?  IT WAS MISERY TO THINK OF MR
ELLIOT'S ATTENTIONS.  THEIR EVIL WAS INCALCULABLE.



CHAPTER 21


ANNE RECOLLECTED WITH PLEASURE THE NEXT MORNING HER PROMISE OF GOING TO
MRS SMITH, MEANING THAT IT SHOULD ENGAGE HER FROM HOME AT THE TIME WHEN
MR ELLIOT WOULD BE MOST LIKELY TO CALL; FOR TO AVOID MR ELLIOT WAS
ALMOST A FIRST OBJECT.

SHE FELT A GREAT DEAL OF GOOD-WILL TOWARDS HIM.  IN SPITE OF THE
MISCHIEF OF HIS ATTENTIONS, SHE OWED HIM GRATITUDE AND REGARD, PERHAPS
COMPASSION.  SHE COULD NOT HELP THINKING MUCH OF THE EXTRAORDINARY
CIRCUMSTANCES ATTENDING THEIR ACQUAINTANCE, OF THE RIGHT WHICH HE
SEEMED TO HAVE TO INTEREST HER, BY EVERYTHING IN SITUATION, BY HIS OWN
SENTIMENTS, BY HIS EARLY PREPOSSESSION.  IT WAS ALTOGETHER VERY
EXTRAORDINARY; FLATTERING, BUT PAINFUL.  THERE WAS MUCH TO REGRET.  HOW
SHE MIGHT HAVE FELT HAD THERE BEEN NO CAPTAIN WENTWORTH IN THE CASE,
WAS NOT WORTH ENQUIRY; FOR THERE WAS A CAPTAIN WENTWORTH; AND BE THE
CONCLUSION OF THE PRESENT SUSPENSE GOOD OR BAD, HER AFFECTION WOULD BE
HIS FOR EVER.  THEIR UNION, SHE BELIEVED, COULD NOT DIVIDE HER MORE
FROM OTHER MEN, THAN THEIR FINAL SEPARATION.

PRETTIER MUSINGS OF HIGH-WROUGHT LOVE AND ETERNAL CONSTANCY, COULD
NEVER HAVE PASSED ALONG THE STREETS OF BATH, THAN ANNE WAS SPORTING
WITH FROM CAMDEN PLACE TO WESTGATE BUILDINGS.  IT WAS ALMOST ENOUGH TO
SPREAD PURIFICATION AND PERFUME ALL THE WAY.

SHE WAS SURE OF A PLEASANT RECEPTION; AND HER FRIEND SEEMED THIS
MORNING PARTICULARLY OBLIGED TO HER FOR COMING, SEEMED HARDLY TO HAVE
EXPECTED HER, THOUGH IT HAD BEEN AN APPOINTMENT.

AN ACCOUNT OF THE CONCERT WAS IMMEDIATELY CLAIMED; AND ANNE'S
RECOLLECTIONS OF THE CONCERT WERE QUITE HAPPY ENOUGH TO ANIMATE HER
FEATURES AND MAKE HER REJOICE TO TALK OF IT.  ALL THAT SHE COULD TELL
SHE TOLD MOST GLADLY, BUT THE ALL WAS LITTLE FOR ONE WHO HAD BEEN
THERE, AND UNSATISFACTORY FOR SUCH AN ENQUIRER AS MRS SMITH, WHO HAD
ALREADY HEARD, THROUGH THE SHORT CUT OF A LAUNDRESS AND A WAITER,
RATHER MORE OF THE GENERAL SUCCESS AND PRODUCE OF THE EVENING THAN ANNE
COULD RELATE, AND WHO NOW ASKED IN VAIN FOR SEVERAL PARTICULARS OF THE
COMPANY.  EVERYBODY OF ANY CONSEQUENCE OR NOTORIETY IN BATH WAS WELL
KNOW BY NAME TO MRS SMITH.

"THE LITTLE DURANDS WERE THERE, I CONCLUDE," SAID SHE, "WITH THEIR
MOUTHS OPEN TO CATCH THE MUSIC, LIKE UNFLEDGED SPARROWS READY TO BE
FED.  THEY NEVER MISS A CONCERT."

"YES; I DID NOT SEE THEM MYSELF, BUT I HEARD MR ELLIOT SAY THEY WERE IN
THE ROOM."

"THE IBBOTSONS, WERE THEY THERE? AND THE TWO NEW BEAUTIES, WITH THE
TALL IRISH OFFICER, WHO IS TALKED OF FOR ONE OF THEM."

"I DO NOT KNOW.  I DO NOT THINK THEY WERE."

"OLD LADY MARY MACLEAN?  I NEED NOT ASK AFTER HER.  SHE NEVER MISSES, I
KNOW; AND YOU MUST HAVE SEEN HER.  SHE MUST HAVE BEEN IN YOUR OWN
CIRCLE; FOR AS YOU WENT WITH LADY DALRYMPLE, YOU WERE IN THE SEATS OF
GRANDEUR, ROUND THE ORCHESTRA, OF COURSE."

"NO, THAT WAS WHAT I DREADED.  IT WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY UNPLEASANT TO ME
IN EVERY RESPECT.  BUT HAPPILY LADY DALRYMPLE ALWAYS CHOOSES TO BE
FARTHER OFF; AND WE WERE EXCEEDINGLY WELL PLACED, THAT IS, FOR HEARING;
I MUST NOT SAY FOR SEEING, BECAUSE I APPEAR TO HAVE SEEN VERY LITTLE."

"OH! YOU SAW ENOUGH FOR YOUR OWN AMUSEMENT.  I CAN UNDERSTAND.  THERE
IS A SORT OF DOMESTIC ENJOYMENT TO BE KNOWN EVEN IN A CROWD, AND THIS
YOU HAD.  YOU WERE A LARGE PARTY IN YOURSELVES, AND YOU WANTED NOTHING
BEYOND."

"BUT I OUGHT TO HAVE LOOKED ABOUT ME MORE," SAID ANNE, CONSCIOUS WHILE
SHE SPOKE THAT THERE HAD IN FACT BEEN NO WANT OF LOOKING ABOUT, THAT
THE OBJECT ONLY HAD BEEN DEFICIENT.

"NO, NO; YOU WERE BETTER EMPLOYED.  YOU NEED NOT TELL ME THAT YOU HAD A
PLEASANT EVENING.  I SEE IT IN YOUR EYE.  I PERFECTLY SEE HOW THE HOURS
PASSED:  THAT YOU HAD ALWAYS SOMETHING AGREEABLE TO LISTEN TO.  IN THE
INTERVALS OF THE CONCERT IT WAS CONVERSATION."

ANNE HALF SMILED AND SAID, "DO YOU SEE THAT IN MY EYE?"

"YES, I DO.  YOUR COUNTENANCE PERFECTLY INFORMS ME THAT YOU WERE IN
COMPANY LAST NIGHT WITH THE PERSON WHOM YOU THINK THE MOST AGREEABLE IN
THE WORLD, THE PERSON WHO INTERESTS YOU AT THIS PRESENT TIME MORE THAN
ALL THE REST OF THE WORLD PUT TOGETHER."

A BLUSH OVERSPREAD ANNE'S CHEEKS.  SHE COULD SAY NOTHING.

"AND SUCH BEING THE CASE," CONTINUED MRS SMITH, AFTER A SHORT PAUSE, "I
HOPE YOU BELIEVE THAT I DO KNOW HOW TO VALUE YOUR KINDNESS IN COMING TO
ME THIS MORNING.  IT IS REALLY VERY GOOD OF YOU TO COME AND SIT WITH
ME, WHEN YOU MUST HAVE SO MANY PLEASANTER DEMANDS UPON YOUR TIME."

ANNE HEARD NOTHING OF THIS.  SHE WAS STILL IN THE ASTONISHMENT AND
CONFUSION EXCITED BY HER FRIEND'S PENETRATION, UNABLE TO IMAGINE HOW
ANY REPORT OF CAPTAIN WENTWORTH COULD HAVE REACHED HER.  AFTER ANOTHER
SHORT SILENCE--

"PRAY," SAID MRS SMITH, "IS MR ELLIOT AWARE OF YOUR ACQUAINTANCE WITH
ME?  DOES HE KNOW THAT I AM IN BATH?"

"MR ELLIOT!" REPEATED ANNE, LOOKING UP SURPRISED.  A MOMENT'S
REFLECTION SHEWED HER THE MISTAKE SHE HAD BEEN UNDER.  SHE CAUGHT IT
INSTANTANEOUSLY; AND RECOVERING HER COURAGE WITH THE FEELING OF SAFETY,
SOON ADDED, MORE COMPOSEDLY, "ARE YOU ACQUAINTED WITH MR ELLIOT?"

"I HAVE BEEN A GOOD DEAL ACQUAINTED WITH HIM," REPLIED MRS SMITH,
GRAVELY, "BUT IT SEEMS WORN OUT NOW.  IT IS A GREAT WHILE SINCE WE MET."

"I WAS NOT AT ALL AWARE OF THIS.  YOU NEVER MENTIONED IT BEFORE.  HAD I
KNOWN IT, I WOULD HAVE HAD THE PLEASURE OF TALKING TO HIM ABOUT YOU."

"TO CONFESS THE TRUTH," SAID MRS SMITH, ASSUMING HER USUAL AIR OF
CHEERFULNESS, "THAT IS EXACTLY THE PLEASURE I WANT YOU TO HAVE.  I WANT
YOU TO TALK ABOUT ME TO MR ELLIOT.  I WANT YOUR INTEREST WITH HIM.  HE
CAN BE OF ESSENTIAL SERVICE TO ME; AND IF YOU WOULD HAVE THE GOODNESS,
MY DEAR MISS ELLIOT, TO MAKE IT AN OBJECT TO YOURSELF, OF COURSE IT IS
DONE."

"I SHOULD BE EXTREMELY HAPPY; I HOPE YOU CANNOT DOUBT MY WILLINGNESS TO
BE OF EVEN THE SLIGHTEST USE TO YOU," REPLIED ANNE; "BUT I SUSPECT THAT
YOU ARE CONSIDERING ME AS HAVING A HIGHER CLAIM ON MR ELLIOT, A GREATER
RIGHT TO INFLUENCE HIM, THAN IS REALLY THE CASE.  I AM SURE YOU HAVE,
SOMEHOW OR OTHER, IMBIBED SUCH A NOTION.  YOU MUST CONSIDER ME ONLY AS
MR ELLIOT'S RELATION.  IF IN THAT LIGHT THERE IS ANYTHING WHICH YOU
SUPPOSE HIS COUSIN MIGHT FAIRLY ASK OF HIM, I BEG YOU WOULD NOT
HESITATE TO EMPLOY ME."

MRS SMITH GAVE HER A PENETRATING GLANCE, AND THEN, SMILING, SAID--

"I HAVE BEEN A LITTLE PREMATURE, I PERCEIVE; I BEG YOUR PARDON.  I
OUGHT TO HAVE WAITED FOR OFFICIAL INFORMATION,  BUT NOW, MY DEAR MISS
ELLIOT, AS AN OLD FRIEND, DO GIVE ME A HINT AS TO WHEN I MAY SPEAK.
NEXT WEEK?  TO BE SURE BY NEXT WEEK I MAY BE ALLOWED TO THINK IT ALL
SETTLED, AND BUILD MY OWN SELFISH SCHEMES ON MR ELLIOT'S GOOD FORTUNE."

"NO," REPLIED ANNE, "NOR NEXT WEEK, NOR NEXT, NOR NEXT.  I ASSURE YOU
THAT NOTHING OF THE SORT YOU ARE THINKING OF WILL BE SETTLED ANY WEEK.
I AM NOT GOING TO MARRY MR ELLIOT.  I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHY YOU
IMAGINE I AM?"

MRS SMITH LOOKED AT HER AGAIN, LOOKED EARNESTLY, SMILED, SHOOK HER
HEAD, AND EXCLAIMED--

"NOW, HOW I DO WISH I UNDERSTOOD YOU!  HOW I DO WISH I KNEW WHAT YOU
WERE AT!  I HAVE A GREAT IDEA THAT YOU DO NOT DESIGN TO BE CRUEL, WHEN
THE RIGHT MOMENT OCCURS.  TILL IT DOES COME, YOU KNOW, WE WOMEN NEVER
MEAN TO HAVE ANYBODY.  IT IS A THING OF COURSE AMONG US, THAT EVERY MAN
IS REFUSED, TILL HE OFFERS.  BUT WHY SHOULD YOU BE CRUEL?  LET ME PLEAD
FOR MY--PRESENT FRIEND I CANNOT CALL HIM, BUT FOR MY FORMER FRIEND.
WHERE CAN YOU LOOK FOR A MORE SUITABLE MATCH?  WHERE COULD YOU EXPECT A
MORE GENTLEMANLIKE, AGREEABLE MAN?  LET ME RECOMMEND MR ELLIOT.  I AM
SURE YOU HEAR NOTHING BUT GOOD OF HIM FROM COLONEL WALLIS; AND WHO CAN
KNOW HIM BETTER THAN COLONEL WALLIS?"

"MY DEAR MRS SMITH, MR ELLIOT'S WIFE HAS NOT BEEN DEAD MUCH ABOVE HALF
A YEAR.  HE OUGHT NOT TO BE SUPPOSED TO BE PAYING HIS ADDRESSES TO ANY
ONE."

"OH! IF THESE ARE YOUR ONLY OBJECTIONS," CRIED MRS SMITH, ARCHLY, "MR
ELLIOT IS SAFE, AND I SHALL GIVE MYSELF NO MORE TROUBLE ABOUT HIM.  DO
NOT FORGET ME WHEN YOU ARE MARRIED, THAT'S ALL.  LET HIM KNOW ME TO BE
A FRIEND OF YOURS, AND THEN HE WILL THINK LITTLE OF THE TROUBLE
REQUIRED, WHICH IT IS VERY NATURAL FOR HIM NOW, WITH SO MANY AFFAIRS
AND ENGAGEMENTS OF HIS OWN, TO AVOID AND GET RID OF AS HE CAN; VERY
NATURAL, PERHAPS.  NINETY-NINE OUT OF A HUNDRED WOULD DO THE SAME.  OF
COURSE, HE CANNOT BE AWARE OF THE IMPORTANCE TO ME.  WELL, MY DEAR MISS
ELLIOT, I HOPE AND TRUST YOU WILL BE VERY HAPPY.  MR ELLIOT HAS SENSE
TO UNDERSTAND THE VALUE OF SUCH A WOMAN.  YOUR PEACE WILL NOT BE
SHIPWRECKED AS MINE HAS BEEN.  YOU ARE SAFE IN ALL WORLDLY MATTERS, AND
SAFE IN HIS CHARACTER.  HE WILL NOT BE LED ASTRAY; HE WILL NOT BE
MISLED BY OTHERS TO HIS RUIN."

"NO," SAID ANNE, "I CAN READILY BELIEVE ALL THAT OF MY COUSIN.  HE
SEEMS TO HAVE A CALM DECIDED TEMPER, NOT AT ALL OPEN TO DANGEROUS
IMPRESSIONS.  I CONSIDER HIM WITH GREAT RESPECT.  I HAVE NO REASON,
FROM ANY THING THAT HAS FALLEN WITHIN MY OBSERVATION, TO DO OTHERWISE.
BUT I HAVE NOT KNOWN HIM LONG; AND HE IS NOT A MAN, I THINK, TO BE
KNOWN INTIMATELY SOON.  WILL NOT THIS MANNER OF SPEAKING OF HIM, MRS
SMITH, CONVINCE YOU THAT HE IS NOTHING TO ME?  SURELY THIS MUST BE CALM
ENOUGH.  AND, UPON MY WORD, HE IS NOTHING TO ME.  SHOULD HE EVER
PROPOSE TO ME (WHICH I HAVE VERY LITTLE REASON TO IMAGINE HE HAS ANY
THOUGHT OF DOING), I SHALL NOT ACCEPT HIM.  I ASSURE YOU I SHALL NOT.
I ASSURE YOU, MR ELLIOT HAD NOT THE SHARE WHICH YOU HAVE BEEN
SUPPOSING, IN WHATEVER PLEASURE THE CONCERT OF LAST NIGHT MIGHT AFFORD:
NOT MR ELLIOT; IT IS NOT MR ELLIOT THAT--"

SHE STOPPED, REGRETTING WITH A DEEP BLUSH THAT SHE HAD IMPLIED SO MUCH;
BUT LESS WOULD HARDLY HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENT.  MRS SMITH WOULD HARDLY
HAVE BELIEVED SO SOON IN MR ELLIOT'S FAILURE, BUT FROM THE PERCEPTION
OF THERE BEING A SOMEBODY ELSE.  AS IT WAS, SHE INSTANTLY SUBMITTED,
AND WITH ALL THE SEMBLANCE OF SEEING NOTHING BEYOND; AND ANNE, EAGER TO
ESCAPE FARTHER NOTICE, WAS IMPATIENT TO KNOW WHY MRS SMITH SHOULD HAVE
FANCIED SHE WAS TO MARRY MR ELLIOT; WHERE SHE COULD HAVE RECEIVED THE
IDEA, OR FROM WHOM SHE COULD HAVE HEARD IT.

"DO TELL ME HOW IT FIRST CAME INTO YOUR HEAD."

"IT FIRST CAME INTO MY HEAD," REPLIED MRS SMITH, "UPON FINDING HOW MUCH
YOU WERE TOGETHER, AND FEELING IT TO BE THE MOST PROBABLE THING IN THE
WORLD TO BE WISHED FOR BY EVERYBODY BELONGING TO EITHER OF YOU; AND YOU
MAY DEPEND UPON IT THAT ALL YOUR ACQUAINTANCE HAVE DISPOSED OF YOU IN
THE SAME WAY.  BUT I NEVER HEARD IT SPOKEN OF TILL TWO DAYS AGO."

"AND HAS IT INDEED BEEN SPOKEN OF?"

"DID YOU OBSERVE THE WOMAN WHO OPENED THE DOOR TO YOU WHEN YOU CALLED
YESTERDAY?"

"NO.  WAS NOT IT MRS SPEED, AS USUAL, OR THE MAID?  I OBSERVED NO ONE
IN PARTICULAR."

"IT WAS MY FRIEND MRS ROOKE; NURSE ROOKE; WHO, BY-THE-BYE, HAD A GREAT
CURIOSITY TO SEE YOU, AND WAS DELIGHTED TO BE IN THE WAY TO LET YOU IN.
SHE CAME AWAY FROM MARLBOROUGH BUILDINGS ONLY ON SUNDAY; AND SHE IT WAS
WHO TOLD ME YOU WERE TO MARRY MR ELLIOT.  SHE HAD HAD IT FROM MRS
WALLIS HERSELF, WHICH DID NOT SEEM BAD AUTHORITY.  SHE SAT AN HOUR WITH
ME ON MONDAY EVENING, AND GAVE ME THE WHOLE HISTORY." "THE WHOLE
HISTORY," REPEATED ANNE, LAUGHING.  "SHE COULD NOT MAKE A VERY LONG
HISTORY, I THINK, OF ONE SUCH LITTLE ARTICLE OF UNFOUNDED NEWS."

MRS SMITH SAID NOTHING.

"BUT," CONTINUED ANNE, PRESENTLY, "THOUGH THERE IS NO TRUTH IN MY
HAVING THIS CLAIM ON MR ELLIOT, I SHOULD BE EXTREMELY HAPPY TO BE OF
USE TO YOU IN ANY WAY THAT I COULD.  SHALL I MENTION TO HIM YOUR BEING
IN BATH?  SHALL I TAKE ANY MESSAGE?"

"NO, I THANK YOU:  NO, CERTAINLY NOT.  IN THE WARMTH OF THE MOMENT, AND
UNDER A MISTAKEN IMPRESSION, I MIGHT, PERHAPS, HAVE ENDEAVOURED TO
INTEREST YOU IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES; BUT NOT NOW.  NO, I THANK YOU, I
HAVE NOTHING TO TROUBLE YOU WITH."

"I THINK YOU SPOKE OF HAVING KNOWN MR ELLIOT MANY YEARS?"

"I DID."

"NOT BEFORE HE WAS MARRIED, I SUPPOSE?"

"YES; HE WAS NOT MARRIED WHEN I KNEW HIM FIRST."

"AND--WERE YOU MUCH ACQUAINTED?"

"INTIMATELY."

"INDEED!  THEN DO TELL ME WHAT HE WAS AT THAT TIME OF LIFE.  I HAVE A
GREAT CURIOSITY TO KNOW WHAT MR ELLIOT WAS AS A VERY YOUNG MAN.  WAS HE
AT ALL SUCH AS HE APPEARS NOW?"

"I HAVE NOT SEEN MR ELLIOT THESE THREE YEARS," WAS MRS SMITH'S ANSWER,
GIVEN SO GRAVELY THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO PURSUE THE SUBJECT FARTHER;
AND ANNE FELT THAT SHE HAD GAINED NOTHING BUT AN INCREASE OF CURIOSITY.
THEY WERE BOTH SILENT:  MRS SMITH VERY THOUGHTFUL.  AT LAST--

"I BEG YOUR PARDON, MY DEAR MISS ELLIOT," SHE CRIED, IN HER NATURAL
TONE OF CORDIALITY, "I BEG YOUR PARDON FOR THE SHORT ANSWERS I HAVE
BEEN GIVING YOU, BUT I HAVE BEEN UNCERTAIN WHAT I OUGHT TO DO.  I HAVE
BEEN DOUBTING AND CONSIDERING AS TO WHAT I OUGHT TO TELL YOU.  THERE
WERE MANY THINGS TO BE TAKEN INTO THE ACCOUNT.  ONE HATES TO BE
OFFICIOUS, TO BE GIVING BAD IMPRESSIONS, MAKING MISCHIEF.  EVEN THE
SMOOTH SURFACE OF FAMILY-UNION SEEMS WORTH PRESERVING, THOUGH THERE MAY
BE NOTHING DURABLE BENEATH.  HOWEVER, I HAVE DETERMINED; I THINK I AM
RIGHT; I THINK YOU OUGHT TO BE MADE ACQUAINTED WITH MR ELLIOT'S REAL
CHARACTER.  THOUGH I FULLY BELIEVE THAT, AT PRESENT, YOU HAVE NOT THE
SMALLEST INTENTION OF ACCEPTING HIM, THERE IS NO SAYING WHAT MAY
HAPPEN.  YOU MIGHT, SOME TIME OR OTHER, BE DIFFERENTLY AFFECTED TOWARDS
HIM.  HEAR THE TRUTH, THEREFORE, NOW, WHILE YOU ARE UNPREJUDICED.  MR
ELLIOT IS A MAN WITHOUT HEART OR CONSCIENCE; A DESIGNING, WARY,
COLD-BLOODED BEING, WHO THINKS ONLY OF HIMSELF; WHOM FOR HIS OWN
INTEREST OR EASE, WOULD BE GUILTY OF ANY CRUELTY, OR ANY TREACHERY,
THAT COULD BE PERPETRATED WITHOUT RISK OF HIS GENERAL CHARACTER.  HE
HAS NO FEELING FOR OTHERS.  THOSE WHOM HE HAS BEEN THE CHIEF CAUSE OF
LEADING INTO RUIN, HE CAN NEGLECT AND DESERT WITHOUT THE SMALLEST
COMPUNCTION.  HE IS TOTALLY BEYOND THE REACH OF ANY SENTIMENT OF
JUSTICE OR COMPASSION.  OH! HE IS BLACK AT HEART, HOLLOW AND BLACK!"

ANNE'S ASTONISHED AIR, AND EXCLAMATION OF WONDER, MADE HER PAUSE, AND
IN A CALMER MANNER, SHE ADDED,

"MY EXPRESSIONS STARTLE YOU.  YOU MUST ALLOW FOR AN INJURED, ANGRY
WOMAN.  BUT I WILL TRY TO COMMAND MYSELF.  I WILL NOT ABUSE HIM.  I
WILL ONLY TELL YOU WHAT I HAVE FOUND HIM.  FACTS SHALL SPEAK.  HE WAS
THE INTIMATE FRIEND OF MY DEAR HUSBAND, WHO TRUSTED AND LOVED HIM, AND
THOUGHT HIM AS GOOD AS HIMSELF.  THE INTIMACY HAD BEEN FORMED BEFORE
OUR MARRIAGE.  I FOUND THEM MOST INTIMATE FRIENDS; AND I, TOO, BECAME
EXCESSIVELY PLEASED WITH MR ELLIOT, AND ENTERTAINED THE HIGHEST OPINION
OF HIM.  AT NINETEEN, YOU KNOW, ONE DOES NOT THINK VERY SERIOUSLY; BUT
MR ELLIOT APPEARED TO ME QUITE AS GOOD AS OTHERS, AND MUCH MORE
AGREEABLE THAN MOST OTHERS, AND WE WERE ALMOST ALWAYS TOGETHER.  WE
WERE PRINCIPALLY IN TOWN, LIVING IN VERY GOOD STYLE.  HE WAS THEN THE
INFERIOR IN CIRCUMSTANCES; HE WAS THEN THE POOR ONE; HE HAD CHAMBERS IN
THE TEMPLE, AND IT WAS AS MUCH AS HE COULD DO TO SUPPORT THE APPEARANCE
OF A GENTLEMAN.  HE HAD ALWAYS A HOME WITH US WHENEVER HE CHOSE IT; HE
WAS ALWAYS WELCOME; HE WAS LIKE A BROTHER.  MY POOR CHARLES, WHO HAD
THE FINEST, MOST GENEROUS SPIRIT IN THE WORLD, WOULD HAVE DIVIDED HIS
LAST FARTHING WITH HIM; AND I KNOW THAT HIS PURSE WAS OPEN TO HIM; I
KNOW THAT HE OFTEN ASSISTED HIM."

"THIS MUST HAVE BEEN ABOUT THAT VERY PERIOD OF MR ELLIOT'S LIFE," SAID
ANNE, "WHICH HAS ALWAYS EXCITED MY PARTICULAR CURIOSITY.  IT MUST HAVE
BEEN ABOUT THE SAME TIME THAT HE BECAME KNOWN TO MY FATHER AND SISTER.
I NEVER KNEW HIM MYSELF; I ONLY HEARD OF HIM; BUT THERE WAS A SOMETHING
IN HIS CONDUCT THEN, WITH REGARD TO MY FATHER AND SISTER, AND
AFTERWARDS IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF HIS MARRIAGE, WHICH I NEVER COULD
QUITE RECONCILE WITH PRESENT TIMES.  IT SEEMED TO ANNOUNCE A DIFFERENT
SORT OF MAN."

"I KNOW IT ALL, I KNOW IT ALL," CRIED MRS SMITH.  "HE HAD BEEN
INTRODUCED TO SIR WALTER AND YOUR SISTER BEFORE I WAS ACQUAINTED WITH
HIM, BUT I HEARD HIM SPEAK OF THEM FOR EVER.  I KNOW HE WAS INVITED AND
ENCOURAGED, AND I KNOW HE DID NOT CHOOSE TO GO.  I CAN SATISFY YOU,
PERHAPS, ON POINTS WHICH YOU WOULD LITTLE EXPECT; AND AS TO HIS
MARRIAGE, I KNEW ALL ABOUT IT AT THE TIME.  I WAS PRIVY TO ALL THE FORS
AND AGAINSTS; I WAS THE FRIEND TO WHOM HE CONFIDED HIS HOPES AND PLANS;
AND THOUGH I DID NOT KNOW HIS WIFE PREVIOUSLY, HER INFERIOR SITUATION
IN SOCIETY, INDEED, RENDERED THAT IMPOSSIBLE, YET I KNEW HER ALL HER
LIFE AFTERWARDS, OR AT LEAST TILL WITHIN THE LAST TWO YEARS OF HER
LIFE, AND CAN ANSWER ANY QUESTION YOU MAY WISH TO PUT."

"NAY," SAID ANNE, "I HAVE NO PARTICULAR ENQUIRY TO MAKE ABOUT HER.  I
HAVE ALWAYS UNDERSTOOD THEY WERE NOT A HAPPY COUPLE.  BUT I SHOULD LIKE
TO KNOW WHY, AT THAT TIME OF HIS LIFE, HE SHOULD SLIGHT MY FATHER'S
ACQUAINTANCE AS HE DID.  MY FATHER WAS CERTAINLY DISPOSED TO TAKE VERY
KIND AND PROPER NOTICE OF HIM.  WHY DID MR ELLIOT DRAW BACK?"

"MR ELLIOT," REPLIED MRS SMITH, "AT THAT PERIOD OF HIS LIFE, HAD ONE
OBJECT IN VIEW:  TO MAKE HIS FORTUNE, AND BY A RATHER QUICKER PROCESS
THAN THE LAW.  HE WAS DETERMINED TO MAKE IT BY MARRIAGE.  HE WAS
DETERMINED, AT LEAST, NOT TO MAR IT BY AN IMPRUDENT MARRIAGE; AND I
KNOW IT WAS HIS BELIEF (WHETHER JUSTLY OR NOT, OF COURSE I CANNOT
DECIDE), THAT YOUR FATHER AND SISTER, IN THEIR CIVILITIES AND
INVITATIONS, WERE DESIGNING A MATCH BETWEEN THE HEIR AND THE YOUNG
LADY, AND IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE THAT SUCH A MATCH SHOULD HAVE ANSWERED HIS
IDEAS OF WEALTH AND INDEPENDENCE.  THAT WAS HIS MOTIVE FOR DRAWING
BACK, I CAN ASSURE YOU.  HE TOLD ME THE WHOLE STORY.  HE HAD NO
CONCEALMENTS WITH ME.  IT WAS CURIOUS, THAT HAVING JUST LEFT YOU BEHIND
ME IN BATH, MY FIRST AND PRINCIPAL ACQUAINTANCE ON MARRYING SHOULD BE
YOUR COUSIN; AND THAT, THROUGH HIM, I SHOULD BE CONTINUALLY HEARING OF
YOUR FATHER AND SISTER.  HE DESCRIBED ONE MISS ELLIOT, AND I THOUGHT
VERY AFFECTIONATELY OF THE OTHER."

"PERHAPS," CRIED ANNE, STRUCK BY A SUDDEN IDEA, "YOU SOMETIMES SPOKE OF
ME TO MR ELLIOT?"

"TO BE SURE I DID; VERY OFTEN.  I USED TO BOAST OF MY OWN ANNE ELLIOT,
AND VOUCH FOR YOUR BEING A VERY DIFFERENT CREATURE FROM--"

SHE CHECKED HERSELF JUST IN TIME.

"THIS ACCOUNTS FOR SOMETHING WHICH MR ELLIOT SAID LAST NIGHT," CRIED
ANNE.  "THIS EXPLAINS IT.  I FOUND HE HAD BEEN USED TO HEAR OF ME.  I
COULD NOT COMPREHEND HOW.  WHAT WILD IMAGINATIONS ONE FORMS WHERE DEAR
SELF IS CONCERNED!  HOW SURE TO BE MISTAKEN!  BUT I BEG YOUR PARDON; I
HAVE INTERRUPTED YOU.  MR ELLIOT MARRIED THEN COMPLETELY FOR MONEY?
THE CIRCUMSTANCES, PROBABLY, WHICH FIRST OPENED YOUR EYES TO HIS
CHARACTER."

MRS SMITH HESITATED A LITTLE HERE.  "OH! THOSE THINGS ARE TOO COMMON.
WHEN ONE LIVES IN THE WORLD, A MAN OR WOMAN'S MARRYING FOR MONEY IS TOO
COMMON TO STRIKE ONE AS IT OUGHT.  I WAS VERY YOUNG, AND ASSOCIATED
ONLY WITH THE YOUNG, AND WE WERE A THOUGHTLESS, GAY SET, WITHOUT ANY
STRICT RULES OF CONDUCT.  WE LIVED FOR ENJOYMENT.  I THINK DIFFERENTLY
NOW; TIME AND SICKNESS AND SORROW HAVE GIVEN ME OTHER NOTIONS; BUT AT
THAT PERIOD I MUST OWN I SAW NOTHING REPREHENSIBLE IN WHAT MR ELLIOT
WAS DOING.  'TO DO THE BEST FOR HIMSELF,' PASSED AS A DUTY."

"BUT WAS NOT SHE A VERY LOW WOMAN?"

"YES; WHICH I OBJECTED TO, BUT HE WOULD NOT REGARD.  MONEY, MONEY, WAS
ALL THAT HE WANTED.  HER FATHER WAS A GRAZIER, HER GRANDFATHER HAD BEEN
A BUTCHER, BUT THAT WAS ALL NOTHING.  SHE WAS A FINE WOMAN, HAD HAD A
DECENT EDUCATION, WAS BROUGHT FORWARD BY SOME COUSINS, THROWN BY CHANCE
INTO MR ELLIOT'S COMPANY, AND FELL IN LOVE WITH HIM; AND NOT A
DIFFICULTY OR A SCRUPLE WAS THERE ON HIS SIDE, WITH RESPECT TO HER
BIRTH.  ALL HIS CAUTION WAS SPENT IN BEING SECURED OF THE REAL AMOUNT
OF HER FORTUNE, BEFORE HE COMMITTED HIMSELF.  DEPEND UPON IT, WHATEVER
ESTEEM MR ELLIOT MAY HAVE FOR HIS OWN SITUATION IN LIFE NOW, AS A YOUNG
MAN HE HAD NOT THE SMALLEST VALUE FOR IT.  HIS CHANCE FOR THE KELLYNCH
ESTATE WAS SOMETHING, BUT ALL THE HONOUR OF THE FAMILY HE HELD AS CHEAP
AS DIRT.  I HAVE OFTEN HEARD HIM DECLARE, THAT IF BARONETCIES WERE
SALEABLE, ANYBODY SHOULD HAVE HIS FOR FIFTY POUNDS, ARMS AND MOTTO,
NAME AND LIVERY INCLUDED; BUT I WILL NOT PRETEND TO REPEAT HALF THAT I
USED TO HEAR HIM SAY ON THAT SUBJECT.  IT WOULD NOT BE FAIR; AND YET
YOU OUGHT TO HAVE PROOF, FOR WHAT IS ALL THIS BUT ASSERTION, AND YOU
SHALL HAVE PROOF."

"INDEED, MY DEAR MRS SMITH, I WANT NONE," CRIED ANNE.  "YOU HAVE
ASSERTED NOTHING CONTRADICTORY TO WHAT MR ELLIOT APPEARED TO BE SOME
YEARS AGO.  THIS IS ALL IN CONFIRMATION, RATHER, OF WHAT WE USED TO
HEAR AND BELIEVE.  I AM MORE CURIOUS TO KNOW WHY HE SHOULD BE SO
DIFFERENT NOW."

"BUT FOR MY SATISFACTION, IF YOU WILL HAVE THE GOODNESS TO RING FOR
MARY; STAY:  I AM SURE YOU WILL HAVE THE STILL GREATER GOODNESS OF
GOING YOURSELF INTO MY BEDROOM, AND BRINGING ME THE SMALL INLAID BOX
WHICH YOU WILL FIND ON THE UPPER SHELF OF THE CLOSET."

ANNE, SEEING HER FRIEND TO BE EARNESTLY BENT ON IT, DID AS SHE WAS
DESIRED.  THE BOX WAS BROUGHT AND PLACED BEFORE HER, AND MRS SMITH,
SIGHING OVER IT AS SHE UNLOCKED IT, SAID--

"THIS IS FULL OF PAPERS BELONGING TO HIM, TO MY HUSBAND; A SMALL
PORTION ONLY OF WHAT I HAD TO LOOK OVER WHEN I LOST HIM.  THE LETTER I
AM LOOKING FOR WAS ONE WRITTEN BY MR ELLIOT TO HIM BEFORE OUR MARRIAGE,
AND HAPPENED TO BE SAVED; WHY, ONE CAN HARDLY IMAGINE.  BUT HE WAS
CARELESS AND IMMETHODICAL, LIKE OTHER MEN, ABOUT THOSE THINGS; AND WHEN
I CAME TO EXAMINE HIS PAPERS, I FOUND IT WITH OTHERS STILL MORE
TRIVIAL, FROM DIFFERENT PEOPLE SCATTERED HERE AND THERE, WHILE MANY
LETTERS AND MEMORANDUMS OF REAL IMPORTANCE HAD BEEN DESTROYED.  HERE IT
IS; I WOULD NOT BURN IT, BECAUSE BEING EVEN THEN VERY LITTLE SATISFIED
WITH MR ELLIOT, I WAS DETERMINED TO PRESERVE EVERY DOCUMENT OF FORMER
INTIMACY.  I HAVE NOW ANOTHER MOTIVE FOR BEING GLAD THAT I CAN PRODUCE
IT."

THIS WAS THE LETTER, DIRECTED TO "CHARLES SMITH, ESQ. TUNBRIDGE WELLS,"
AND DATED FROM LONDON, AS FAR BACK AS JULY, 1803:--

"DEAR SMITH,--I HAVE RECEIVED YOURS.  YOUR KINDNESS ALMOST OVERPOWERS
ME.  I WISH NATURE HAD MADE SUCH HEARTS AS YOURS MORE COMMON, BUT I
HAVE LIVED THREE-AND-TWENTY YEARS IN THE WORLD, AND HAVE SEEN NONE LIKE
IT.  AT PRESENT, BELIEVE ME, I HAVE NO NEED OF YOUR SERVICES, BEING IN
CASH AGAIN.  GIVE ME JOY:  I HAVE GOT RID OF SIR WALTER AND MISS.  THEY
ARE GONE BACK TO KELLYNCH, AND ALMOST MADE ME SWEAR TO VISIT THEM THIS
SUMMER; BUT MY FIRST VISIT TO KELLYNCH WILL BE WITH A SURVEYOR, TO TELL
ME HOW TO BRING IT WITH BEST ADVANTAGE TO THE HAMMER.  THE BARONET,
NEVERTHELESS, IS NOT UNLIKELY TO MARRY AGAIN; HE IS QUITE FOOL ENOUGH.
IF HE DOES, HOWEVER, THEY WILL LEAVE ME IN PEACE, WHICH MAY BE A DECENT
EQUIVALENT  FOR THE REVERSION.  HE IS WORSE THAN LAST YEAR.

"I WISH I HAD ANY NAME BUT ELLIOT.  I AM SICK OF IT.  THE NAME OF
WALTER I CAN DROP, THANK GOD! AND I DESIRE YOU WILL NEVER INSULT ME
WITH MY SECOND W. AGAIN, MEANING, FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE, TO BE ONLY
YOURS TRULY,--WM. ELLIOT."

SUCH A LETTER COULD NOT BE READ WITHOUT PUTTING ANNE IN A GLOW; AND MRS
SMITH, OBSERVING THE HIGH COLOUR IN HER FACE, SAID--

"THE LANGUAGE, I KNOW, IS HIGHLY DISRESPECTFUL.  THOUGH I HAVE FORGOT
THE EXACT TERMS, I HAVE A PERFECT IMPRESSION OF THE GENERAL MEANING.
BUT IT SHOWS YOU THE MAN.  MARK HIS PROFESSIONS TO MY POOR HUSBAND.
CAN ANY THING BE STRONGER?"

ANNE COULD NOT IMMEDIATELY GET OVER THE SHOCK AND MORTIFICATION OF
FINDING SUCH WORDS APPLIED TO HER FATHER.  SHE WAS OBLIGED TO RECOLLECT
THAT HER SEEING THE LETTER WAS A VIOLATION OF THE LAWS OF HONOUR, THAT
NO ONE OUGHT TO BE JUDGED OR TO BE KNOWN BY SUCH TESTIMONIES, THAT NO
PRIVATE CORRESPONDENCE COULD BEAR THE EYE OF OTHERS, BEFORE SHE COULD
RECOVER CALMNESS ENOUGH TO RETURN THE LETTER WHICH SHE HAD BEEN
MEDITATING OVER, AND SAY--

"THANK YOU.  THIS IS FULL PROOF UNDOUBTEDLY; PROOF OF EVERY THING YOU
WERE SAYING.  BUT WHY BE ACQUAINTED WITH US NOW?"

"I CAN EXPLAIN THIS TOO," CRIED MRS SMITH, SMILING.

"CAN YOU REALLY?"

"YES.  I HAVE SHEWN YOU MR ELLIOT AS HE WAS A DOZEN YEARS AGO, AND I
WILL SHEW HIM AS HE IS NOW.  I CANNOT PRODUCE WRITTEN PROOF AGAIN, BUT
I CAN GIVE AS AUTHENTIC ORAL TESTIMONY AS YOU CAN DESIRE, OF WHAT HE IS
NOW WANTING, AND WHAT HE IS NOW DOING.  HE IS NO HYPOCRITE NOW.  HE
TRULY WANTS TO MARRY YOU.  HIS PRESENT ATTENTIONS TO YOUR FAMILY ARE
VERY SINCERE:  QUITE FROM THE HEART.  I WILL GIVE YOU MY AUTHORITY: HIS
FRIEND COLONEL WALLIS."

"COLONEL WALLIS! YOU ARE ACQUAINTED WITH HIM?"

"NO.  IT DOES NOT COME TO ME IN QUITE SO DIRECT A LINE AS THAT; IT
TAKES A BEND OR TWO, BUT NOTHING OF CONSEQUENCE.  THE STREAM IS AS GOOD
AS AT FIRST; THE LITTLE RUBBISH IT COLLECTS IN THE TURNINGS IS EASILY
MOVED AWAY.  MR ELLIOT TALKS UNRESERVEDLY TO COLONEL WALLIS OF HIS
VIEWS ON YOU, WHICH SAID COLONEL WALLIS, I IMAGINE TO BE, IN HIMSELF, A
SENSIBLE, CAREFUL, DISCERNING SORT OF CHARACTER; BUT COLONEL WALLIS HAS
A VERY PRETTY SILLY WIFE, TO WHOM HE TELLS THINGS WHICH HE HAD BETTER
NOT, AND HE REPEATS IT ALL TO HER.  SHE IN THE OVERFLOWING SPIRITS OF
HER RECOVERY, REPEATS IT ALL TO HER NURSE; AND THE NURSE  KNOWING MY
ACQUAINTANCE WITH YOU, VERY NATURALLY BRINGS IT ALL TO ME.  ON MONDAY
EVENING, MY GOOD FRIEND MRS ROOKE LET ME THUS MUCH INTO THE SECRETS OF
MARLBOROUGH BUILDINGS.  WHEN I TALKED OF A WHOLE HISTORY, THEREFORE,
YOU SEE I WAS NOT ROMANCING SO MUCH AS YOU SUPPOSED."

"MY DEAR MRS SMITH, YOUR AUTHORITY IS DEFICIENT.  THIS WILL NOT DO.  MR
ELLIOT'S HAVING ANY VIEWS ON ME WILL NOT IN THE LEAST ACCOUNT FOR THE
EFFORTS HE MADE TOWARDS A RECONCILIATION WITH MY FATHER.  THAT WAS ALL
PRIOR TO MY COMING TO BATH.  I FOUND THEM ON THE MOST FRIENDLY TERMS
WHEN I ARRIVED."

"I KNOW YOU DID; I KNOW IT ALL PERFECTLY, BUT--"

"INDEED, MRS SMITH, WE MUST NOT EXPECT TO GET REAL INFORMATION IN SUCH
A LINE.  FACTS OR OPINIONS WHICH ARE TO PASS THROUGH THE HANDS OF SO
MANY, TO BE MISCONCEIVED BY FOLLY IN ONE, AND IGNORANCE IN ANOTHER, CAN
HARDLY HAVE MUCH TRUTH LEFT."

"ONLY GIVE ME A HEARING.  YOU WILL SOON BE ABLE TO JUDGE OF THE GENERAL
CREDIT DUE, BY LISTENING TO SOME PARTICULARS WHICH YOU CAN YOURSELF
IMMEDIATELY CONTRADICT OR CONFIRM.  NOBODY SUPPOSES THAT YOU WERE HIS
FIRST INDUCEMENT.  HE HAD SEEN YOU INDEED, BEFORE HE CAME TO BATH, AND
ADMIRED YOU, BUT WITHOUT KNOWING IT TO BE YOU.  SO SAYS MY HISTORIAN,
AT LEAST.  IS THIS TRUE?  DID HE SEE YOU LAST SUMMER OR AUTUMN,
'SOMEWHERE DOWN IN THE WEST,' TO USE HER OWN WORDS, WITHOUT KNOWING IT
TO BE YOU?"

"HE CERTAINLY DID.  SO FAR IT IS VERY TRUE.  AT LYME.  I HAPPENED TO BE
AT LYME."

"WELL," CONTINUED MRS SMITH, TRIUMPHANTLY, "GRANT MY FRIEND THE CREDIT
DUE TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE FIRST POINT ASSERTED.  HE SAW YOU THEN
AT LYME, AND LIKED YOU SO WELL AS TO BE EXCEEDINGLY PLEASED TO MEET
WITH YOU AGAIN IN CAMDEN PLACE, AS MISS ANNE ELLIOT, AND FROM THAT
MOMENT, I HAVE NO DOUBT, HAD A DOUBLE MOTIVE IN HIS VISITS THERE.  BUT
THERE WAS ANOTHER, AND AN EARLIER, WHICH I WILL NOW EXPLAIN.  IF THERE
IS ANYTHING IN MY STORY WHICH YOU KNOW TO BE EITHER FALSE OR
IMPROBABLE, STOP ME.  MY ACCOUNT STATES, THAT YOUR SISTER'S FRIEND, THE
LADY NOW STAYING WITH YOU, WHOM I HAVE HEARD YOU MENTION, CAME TO BATH
WITH MISS ELLIOT AND SIR WALTER AS LONG AGO AS SEPTEMBER (IN SHORT WHEN
THEY FIRST CAME THEMSELVES), AND HAS BEEN STAYING THERE EVER SINCE;
THAT SHE IS A CLEVER, INSINUATING, HANDSOME WOMAN, POOR AND PLAUSIBLE,
AND ALTOGETHER SUCH IN SITUATION AND MANNER, AS TO GIVE A GENERAL IDEA,
AMONG SIR WALTER'S ACQUAINTANCE, OF HER MEANING TO BE LADY ELLIOT, AND
AS GENERAL A SURPRISE THAT MISS ELLIOT SHOULD BE APPARENTLY, BLIND TO
THE DANGER."

HERE MRS SMITH PAUSED A MOMENT; BUT ANNE HAD NOT A WORD TO SAY, AND SHE
CONTINUED--

"THIS WAS THE LIGHT IN WHICH IT APPEARED TO THOSE WHO KNEW THE FAMILY,
LONG BEFORE YOU RETURNED TO IT; AND COLONEL WALLIS HAD HIS EYE UPON
YOUR FATHER ENOUGH TO BE SENSIBLE OF IT, THOUGH HE DID NOT THEN VISIT
IN CAMDEN PLACE; BUT HIS REGARD FOR MR ELLIOT GAVE HIM AN INTEREST IN
WATCHING ALL THAT WAS GOING ON THERE, AND WHEN MR ELLIOT CAME TO BATH
FOR A DAY OR TWO, AS HE HAPPENED TO DO A LITTLE BEFORE CHRISTMAS,
COLONEL WALLIS MADE HIM ACQUAINTED WITH THE APPEARANCE OF THINGS, AND
THE REPORTS BEGINNING TO PREVAIL.  NOW YOU ARE TO UNDERSTAND, THAT TIME
HAD WORKED A VERY MATERIAL CHANGE IN MR ELLIOT'S OPINIONS AS TO THE
VALUE OF A BARONETCY.  UPON ALL POINTS OF BLOOD AND CONNEXION HE IS A
COMPLETELY ALTERED MAN.  HAVING LONG HAD AS MUCH MONEY AS HE COULD
SPEND, NOTHING TO WISH FOR ON THE SIDE OF AVARICE OR INDULGENCE, HE HAS
BEEN GRADUALLY LEARNING TO PIN HIS HAPPINESS UPON THE CONSEQUENCE HE IS
HEIR TO.  I THOUGHT IT COMING ON BEFORE OUR ACQUAINTANCE CEASED, BUT IT
IS NOW A CONFIRMED FEELING.  HE CANNOT BEAR THE IDEA OF NOT BEING SIR
WILLIAM.  YOU MAY GUESS, THEREFORE, THAT THE NEWS HE HEARD FROM HIS
FRIEND COULD NOT BE VERY AGREEABLE, AND YOU MAY GUESS WHAT IT PRODUCED;
THE RESOLUTION OF COMING BACK TO BATH AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, AND OF
FIXING HIMSELF HERE FOR A TIME, WITH THE VIEW OF RENEWING HIS FORMER
ACQUAINTANCE, AND RECOVERING SUCH A FOOTING IN THE FAMILY AS MIGHT GIVE
HIM THE MEANS OF ASCERTAINING THE DEGREE OF HIS DANGER, AND OF
CIRCUMVENTING THE LADY IF HE FOUND IT MATERIAL.  THIS WAS AGREED UPON
BETWEEN THE TWO FRIENDS AS THE ONLY THING TO BE DONE; AND COLONEL
WALLIS WAS TO ASSIST IN EVERY WAY THAT HE COULD.  HE WAS TO BE
INTRODUCED, AND MRS WALLIS WAS TO BE INTRODUCED, AND EVERYBODY WAS TO
BE INTRODUCED.  MR ELLIOT CAME BACK ACCORDINGLY; AND ON APPLICATION WAS
FORGIVEN, AS YOU KNOW, AND RE-ADMITTED INTO THE FAMILY; AND THERE IT
WAS HIS CONSTANT OBJECT, AND HIS ONLY OBJECT (TILL YOUR ARRIVAL ADDED
ANOTHER MOTIVE), TO WATCH SIR WALTER AND MRS CLAY.  HE OMITTED NO
OPPORTUNITY OF BEING WITH THEM, THREW HIMSELF IN THEIR WAY, CALLED AT
ALL HOURS; BUT I NEED NOT BE PARTICULAR ON THIS SUBJECT.  YOU CAN
IMAGINE WHAT AN ARTFUL MAN WOULD DO; AND WITH THIS GUIDE, PERHAPS, MAY
RECOLLECT WHAT YOU HAVE SEEN HIM DO."

"YES," SAID ANNE, "YOU TELL ME NOTHING WHICH DOES NOT ACCORD WITH WHAT
I HAVE KNOWN, OR COULD IMAGINE.  THERE IS ALWAYS SOMETHING OFFENSIVE IN
THE DETAILS OF CUNNING.  THE MANOEUVRES OF SELFISHNESS AND DUPLICITY
MUST EVER BE REVOLTING, BUT I HAVE HEARD NOTHING WHICH REALLY SURPRISES
ME.  I KNOW THOSE WHO WOULD BE SHOCKED BY SUCH A REPRESENTATION OF MR
ELLIOT, WHO WOULD HAVE DIFFICULTY IN BELIEVING IT; BUT I HAVE NEVER
BEEN SATISFIED.  I HAVE ALWAYS WANTED SOME OTHER MOTIVE FOR HIS CONDUCT
THAN APPEARED.  I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW HIS PRESENT OPINION, AS TO THE
PROBABILITY OF THE EVENT HE HAS BEEN IN DREAD OF; WHETHER HE CONSIDERS
THE DANGER TO BE LESSENING OR NOT."

"LESSENING, I UNDERSTAND," REPLIED MRS SMITH.  "HE THINKS MRS CLAY
AFRAID OF HIM, AWARE THAT HE SEES THROUGH HER, AND NOT DARING TO
PROCEED AS SHE MIGHT DO IN HIS ABSENCE.  BUT SINCE HE MUST BE ABSENT
SOME TIME OR OTHER, I DO NOT PERCEIVE HOW HE CAN EVER BE SECURE WHILE
SHE HOLDS HER PRESENT INFLUENCE.  MRS WALLIS HAS AN AMUSING IDEA, AS
NURSE TELLS ME, THAT IT IS TO BE PUT INTO THE MARRIAGE ARTICLES WHEN
YOU AND MR ELLIOT MARRY, THAT YOUR FATHER IS NOT TO MARRY MRS CLAY.  A
SCHEME, WORTHY OF MRS WALLIS'S UNDERSTANDING, BY ALL ACCOUNTS; BUT MY
SENSIBLE NURSE ROOKE SEES THE ABSURDITY OF IT.  'WHY, TO BE SURE,
MA'AM,' SAID SHE, 'IT WOULD NOT PREVENT HIS MARRYING ANYBODY ELSE.'
AND, INDEED, TO OWN THE TRUTH, I DO NOT THINK NURSE, IN HER HEART, IS A
VERY STRENUOUS OPPOSER OF SIR WALTER'S MAKING A SECOND MATCH.  SHE MUST
BE ALLOWED TO BE A FAVOURER OF MATRIMONY, YOU KNOW; AND (SINCE SELF
WILL INTRUDE) WHO CAN SAY THAT SHE MAY NOT HAVE SOME FLYING VISIONS OF
ATTENDING THE NEXT LADY ELLIOT, THROUGH MRS WALLIS'S RECOMMENDATION?"

"I AM VERY GLAD TO KNOW ALL THIS," SAID ANNE, AFTER A LITTLE
THOUGHTFULNESS.  "IT WILL BE MORE PAINFUL TO ME IN SOME RESPECTS TO BE
IN COMPANY WITH HIM, BUT I SHALL KNOW BETTER WHAT TO DO.  MY LINE OF
CONDUCT WILL BE MORE DIRECT.  MR ELLIOT IS EVIDENTLY A DISINGENUOUS,
ARTIFICIAL, WORLDLY MAN, WHO HAS NEVER HAD ANY BETTER PRINCIPLE TO
GUIDE HIM THAN SELFISHNESS."

BUT MR ELLIOT WAS NOT DONE WITH.  MRS SMITH HAD BEEN CARRIED AWAY FROM
HER FIRST DIRECTION, AND ANNE HAD FORGOTTEN, IN THE INTEREST OF HER OWN
FAMILY CONCERNS, HOW MUCH HAD BEEN ORIGINALLY IMPLIED AGAINST HIM; BUT
HER ATTENTION WAS NOW CALLED TO THE EXPLANATION OF THOSE FIRST HINTS,
AND SHE LISTENED TO A RECITAL WHICH, IF IT DID NOT PERFECTLY JUSTIFY
THE UNQUALIFIED BITTERNESS OF MRS SMITH, PROVED HIM TO HAVE BEEN VERY
UNFEELING IN HIS CONDUCT TOWARDS HER; VERY DEFICIENT BOTH IN JUSTICE
AND COMPASSION.

SHE LEARNED THAT (THE INTIMACY BETWEEN THEM CONTINUING UNIMPAIRED BY MR
ELLIOT'S MARRIAGE) THEY HAD BEEN AS BEFORE ALWAYS TOGETHER, AND MR
ELLIOT HAD LED HIS FRIEND INTO EXPENSES MUCH BEYOND HIS FORTUNE.  MRS
SMITH DID NOT WANT TO TAKE BLAME TO HERSELF, AND WAS MOST TENDER OF
THROWING ANY ON HER HUSBAND; BUT ANNE COULD COLLECT THAT THEIR INCOME
HAD NEVER BEEN EQUAL TO THEIR STYLE OF LIVING, AND THAT FROM THE FIRST
THERE HAD BEEN A GREAT DEAL OF GENERAL AND JOINT EXTRAVAGANCE.  FROM
HIS WIFE'S ACCOUNT OF HIM SHE COULD DISCERN MR SMITH TO HAVE BEEN A MAN
OF WARM FEELINGS, EASY TEMPER, CARELESS HABITS, AND NOT STRONG
UNDERSTANDING, MUCH MORE AMIABLE THAN HIS FRIEND, AND VERY UNLIKE HIM,
LED BY HIM, AND PROBABLY DESPISED BY HIM.  MR ELLIOT, RAISED BY HIS
MARRIAGE TO GREAT AFFLUENCE, AND DISPOSED TO EVERY GRATIFICATION OF
PLEASURE AND VANITY WHICH COULD BE COMMANDED WITHOUT INVOLVING HIMSELF,
(FOR WITH ALL HIS SELF-INDULGENCE HE HAD BECOME A PRUDENT MAN), AND
BEGINNING TO BE RICH, JUST AS HIS FRIEND OUGHT TO HAVE FOUND HIMSELF TO
BE POOR, SEEMED TO HAVE HAD NO CONCERN AT ALL FOR THAT FRIEND'S
PROBABLE FINANCES, BUT, ON THE CONTRARY, HAD BEEN PROMPTING AND
ENCOURAGING EXPENSES WHICH COULD END ONLY IN RUIN; AND THE SMITHS
ACCORDINGLY HAD BEEN RUINED.

THE HUSBAND HAD DIED JUST IN TIME TO BE SPARED THE FULL KNOWLEDGE OF
IT.  THEY HAD PREVIOUSLY KNOWN EMBARRASSMENTS ENOUGH TO TRY THE
FRIENDSHIP OF THEIR FRIENDS, AND TO PROVE THAT MR ELLIOT'S HAD BETTER
NOT BE TRIED; BUT IT WAS NOT TILL HIS DEATH THAT THE WRETCHED STATE OF
HIS AFFAIRS WAS FULLY KNOWN.  WITH A CONFIDENCE IN MR ELLIOT'S REGARD,
MORE CREDITABLE TO HIS FEELINGS THAN HIS JUDGEMENT, MR SMITH HAD
APPOINTED HIM THE EXECUTOR OF HIS WILL; BUT MR ELLIOT WOULD NOT ACT,
AND THE DIFFICULTIES AND DISTRESS WHICH THIS REFUSAL HAD HEAPED ON HER,
IN ADDITION TO THE INEVITABLE SUFFERINGS OF HER SITUATION, HAD BEEN
SUCH AS COULD NOT BE RELATED WITHOUT ANGUISH OF SPIRIT, OR LISTENED TO
WITHOUT CORRESPONDING INDIGNATION.

ANNE WAS SHEWN SOME LETTERS OF HIS ON THE OCCASION, ANSWERS TO URGENT
APPLICATIONS FROM MRS SMITH, WHICH ALL BREATHED THE SAME STERN
RESOLUTION OF NOT ENGAGING IN A FRUITLESS TROUBLE, AND, UNDER A COLD
CIVILITY, THE SAME HARD-HEARTED INDIFFERENCE TO ANY OF THE EVILS IT
MIGHT BRING ON HER.  IT WAS A DREADFUL PICTURE OF INGRATITUDE AND
INHUMANITY; AND ANNE FELT, AT SOME MOMENTS, THAT NO FLAGRANT OPEN CRIME
COULD HAVE BEEN WORSE.  SHE HAD A GREAT DEAL TO LISTEN TO; ALL THE
PARTICULARS OF PAST SAD SCENES, ALL THE MINUTIAE OF DISTRESS UPON
DISTRESS, WHICH IN FORMER CONVERSATIONS HAD BEEN MERELY HINTED AT, WERE
DWELT ON NOW WITH A NATURAL INDULGENCE.  ANNE COULD PERFECTLY
COMPREHEND THE EXQUISITE RELIEF, AND WAS ONLY THE MORE INCLINED TO
WONDER AT THE COMPOSURE OF HER FRIEND'S USUAL STATE OF MIND.

THERE WAS ONE CIRCUMSTANCE IN THE HISTORY OF HER GRIEVANCES OF
PARTICULAR IRRITATION.  SHE HAD GOOD REASON TO BELIEVE THAT SOME
PROPERTY OF HER HUSBAND IN THE WEST INDIES, WHICH HAD BEEN FOR MANY
YEARS UNDER A SORT OF SEQUESTRATION FOR THE PAYMENT OF ITS OWN
INCUMBRANCES, MIGHT BE RECOVERABLE BY PROPER MEASURES; AND THIS
PROPERTY, THOUGH NOT LARGE, WOULD BE ENOUGH TO MAKE HER COMPARATIVELY
RICH.  BUT THERE WAS NOBODY TO STIR IN IT.  MR ELLIOT WOULD DO NOTHING,
AND SHE COULD DO NOTHING HERSELF, EQUALLY DISABLED FROM PERSONAL
EXERTION BY HER STATE OF BODILY WEAKNESS, AND FROM EMPLOYING OTHERS BY
HER WANT OF MONEY.  SHE HAD NO NATURAL CONNEXIONS TO ASSIST HER EVEN
WITH THEIR COUNSEL, AND SHE COULD NOT AFFORD TO PURCHASE THE ASSISTANCE
OF THE LAW.  THIS WAS A CRUEL AGGRAVATION OF ACTUALLY STRAITENED MEANS.
TO FEEL THAT SHE OUGHT TO BE IN BETTER CIRCUMSTANCES, THAT A LITTLE
TROUBLE IN THE RIGHT PLACE MIGHT DO IT, AND TO FEAR THAT DELAY MIGHT BE
EVEN WEAKENING HER CLAIMS, WAS HARD TO BEAR.

IT WAS ON THIS POINT THAT SHE HAD HOPED TO ENGAGE ANNE'S GOOD OFFICES
WITH MR ELLIOT.  SHE HAD PREVIOUSLY, IN THE ANTICIPATION OF THEIR
MARRIAGE, BEEN VERY APPREHENSIVE OF LOSING HER FRIEND BY IT; BUT ON
BEING ASSURED THAT HE COULD HAVE MADE NO ATTEMPT OF THAT NATURE, SINCE
HE DID NOT EVEN KNOW HER TO BE IN BATH, IT IMMEDIATELY OCCURRED, THAT
SOMETHING MIGHT BE DONE IN HER FAVOUR BY THE INFLUENCE OF THE WOMAN HE
LOVED, AND SHE HAD BEEN HASTILY PREPARING TO INTEREST ANNE'S FEELINGS,
AS FAR AS THE OBSERVANCES DUE TO MR ELLIOT'S CHARACTER WOULD ALLOW,
WHEN ANNE'S REFUTATION OF THE SUPPOSED ENGAGEMENT CHANGED THE FACE OF
EVERYTHING; AND WHILE IT TOOK FROM HER THE NEW-FORMED HOPE OF
SUCCEEDING IN THE OBJECT OF HER FIRST ANXIETY, LEFT HER AT LEAST THE
COMFORT OF TELLING THE WHOLE STORY HER OWN WAY.

AFTER LISTENING TO THIS FULL DESCRIPTION OF MR ELLIOT, ANNE COULD NOT
BUT EXPRESS SOME SURPRISE AT MRS SMITH'S HAVING SPOKEN OF HIM SO
FAVOURABLY IN THE BEGINNING OF THEIR CONVERSATION.  "SHE HAD SEEMED TO
RECOMMEND AND PRAISE HIM!"

"MY DEAR," WAS MRS SMITH'S REPLY, "THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE TO BE DONE.
I CONSIDERED YOUR MARRYING HIM AS CERTAIN, THOUGH HE MIGHT NOT YET HAVE
MADE THE OFFER, AND I COULD NO MORE SPEAK THE TRUTH OF HIM, THAN IF HE
HAD BEEN YOUR HUSBAND.  MY HEART BLED FOR YOU, AS I TALKED OF
HAPPINESS; AND YET HE IS SENSIBLE, HE IS AGREEABLE, AND WITH SUCH A
WOMAN AS YOU, IT WAS NOT ABSOLUTELY HOPELESS.  HE WAS VERY UNKIND TO
HIS FIRST WIFE.  THEY WERE WRETCHED TOGETHER.  BUT SHE WAS TOO IGNORANT
AND GIDDY FOR RESPECT, AND HE HAD NEVER LOVED HER.  I WAS WILLING TO
HOPE THAT YOU MUST FARE BETTER."

ANNE COULD JUST ACKNOWLEDGE WITHIN HERSELF SUCH A POSSIBILITY OF HAVING
BEEN INDUCED TO MARRY HIM, AS MADE HER SHUDDER AT THE IDEA OF THE
MISERY WHICH MUST HAVE FOLLOWED.  IT WAS JUST POSSIBLE THAT SHE MIGHT
HAVE BEEN PERSUADED BY LADY RUSSELL!  AND UNDER SUCH A SUPPOSITION,
WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN MOST MISERABLE, WHEN TIME HAD DISCLOSED ALL, TOO
LATE?

IT WAS VERY DESIRABLE THAT LADY RUSSELL SHOULD BE NO LONGER DECEIVED;
AND ONE OF THE CONCLUDING ARRANGEMENTS OF THIS IMPORTANT CONFERENCE,
WHICH CARRIED THEM THROUGH THE GREATER PART OF THE MORNING, WAS, THAT
ANNE HAD FULL LIBERTY TO COMMUNICATE TO HER FRIEND EVERYTHING RELATIVE
TO MRS SMITH, IN WHICH HIS CONDUCT WAS INVOLVED.



CHAPTER 22


ANNE WENT HOME TO THINK OVER ALL THAT SHE HAD HEARD.  IN ONE POINT, HER
FEELINGS WERE RELIEVED BY THIS KNOWLEDGE OF MR ELLIOT.  THERE WAS NO
LONGER ANYTHING OF TENDERNESS DUE TO HIM.  HE STOOD AS OPPOSED TO
CAPTAIN WENTWORTH, IN ALL HIS OWN UNWELCOME OBTRUSIVENESS; AND THE EVIL
OF HIS ATTENTIONS LAST NIGHT, THE IRREMEDIABLE MISCHIEF HE MIGHT HAVE
DONE, WAS CONSIDERED WITH SENSATIONS UNQUALIFIED, UNPERPLEXED.  PITY
FOR HIM WAS ALL OVER.  BUT THIS WAS THE ONLY POINT OF RELIEF.  IN EVERY
OTHER RESPECT, IN LOOKING AROUND HER, OR PENETRATING FORWARD, SHE SAW
MORE TO DISTRUST AND TO APPREHEND.  SHE WAS CONCERNED FOR THE
DISAPPOINTMENT AND PAIN LADY RUSSELL WOULD BE FEELING; FOR THE
MORTIFICATIONS WHICH MUST BE HANGING OVER HER FATHER AND SISTER, AND
HAD ALL THE DISTRESS OF FORESEEING MANY EVILS, WITHOUT KNOWING HOW TO
AVERT ANY ONE OF THEM.  SHE WAS MOST THANKFUL FOR HER OWN KNOWLEDGE OF
HIM.  SHE HAD NEVER CONSIDERED HERSELF AS ENTITLED TO REWARD FOR NOT
SLIGHTING AN OLD FRIEND LIKE MRS SMITH, BUT HERE WAS A REWARD INDEED
SPRINGING FROM IT!  MRS SMITH HAD BEEN ABLE TO TELL HER WHAT NO ONE
ELSE COULD HAVE DONE.  COULD THE KNOWLEDGE HAVE BEEN EXTENDED THROUGH
HER FAMILY?  BUT THIS WAS A VAIN IDEA.  SHE MUST TALK TO LADY RUSSELL,
TELL HER, CONSULT WITH HER, AND HAVING DONE HER BEST, WAIT THE EVENT
WITH AS MUCH COMPOSURE AS POSSIBLE; AND AFTER ALL, HER GREATEST WANT OF
COMPOSURE WOULD BE IN THAT QUARTER OF THE MIND WHICH COULD NOT BE
OPENED TO LADY RUSSELL; IN THAT FLOW OF ANXIETIES AND FEARS WHICH MUST
BE ALL TO HERSELF.


SHE FOUND, ON REACHING HOME, THAT SHE HAD, AS SHE INTENDED, ESCAPED
SEEING MR ELLIOT; THAT HE HAD CALLED AND PAID THEM A LONG MORNING
VISIT; BUT HARDLY HAD SHE CONGRATULATED HERSELF, AND FELT SAFE, WHEN
SHE HEARD THAT HE WAS COMING AGAIN IN THE EVENING.

"I HAD NOT THE SMALLEST INTENTION OF ASKING HIM," SAID ELIZABETH, WITH
AFFECTED CARELESSNESS, "BUT HE GAVE SO MANY HINTS; SO MRS CLAY SAYS, AT
LEAST."

"INDEED, I DO SAY IT.  I NEVER SAW ANYBODY IN MY LIFE SPELL HARDER FOR
AN INVITATION.  POOR MAN!  I WAS REALLY IN PAIN FOR HIM; FOR YOUR
HARD-HEARTED SISTER, MISS ANNE, SEEMS BENT ON CRUELTY."

"OH!" CRIED ELIZABETH, "I HAVE BEEN RATHER TOO MUCH USED TO THE GAME TO
BE SOON OVERCOME BY A GENTLEMAN'S HINTS.  HOWEVER, WHEN I FOUND HOW
EXCESSIVELY HE WAS REGRETTING THAT HE SHOULD MISS MY FATHER THIS
MORNING, I GAVE WAY IMMEDIATELY, FOR I WOULD NEVER REALLY OMIT AN
OPPORTUNITY OF BRING HIM AND SIR WALTER TOGETHER.  THEY APPEAR TO SO
MUCH ADVANTAGE IN COMPANY WITH EACH OTHER.  EACH BEHAVING SO
PLEASANTLY.  MR ELLIOT LOOKING UP WITH SO MUCH RESPECT."

"QUITE DELIGHTFUL!" CRIED MRS CLAY, NOT DARING, HOWEVER, TO TURN HER
EYES TOWARDS ANNE.  "EXACTLY LIKE FATHER AND SON!  DEAR MISS ELLIOT,
MAY I NOT SAY FATHER AND SON?"

"OH! I LAY NO EMBARGO ON ANY BODY'S WORDS.  IF YOU WILL HAVE SUCH
IDEAS!  BUT, UPON MY WORD, I AM SCARCELY SENSIBLE OF HIS ATTENTIONS
BEING BEYOND THOSE OF OTHER MEN."

"MY DEAR MISS ELLIOT!" EXCLAIMED MRS CLAY, LIFTING HER HANDS AND EYES,
AND SINKING ALL THE REST OF HER ASTONISHMENT IN A CONVENIENT SILENCE.

"WELL, MY DEAR PENELOPE, YOU NEED NOT BE SO ALARMED ABOUT HIM.  I DID
INVITE HIM, YOU KNOW.  I SENT HIM AWAY WITH SMILES.  WHEN I FOUND HE
WAS REALLY GOING TO HIS FRIENDS AT THORNBERRY PARK FOR THE WHOLE DAY
TO-MORROW, I HAD COMPASSION ON HIM."

ANNE ADMIRED THE GOOD ACTING OF THE FRIEND, IN BEING ABLE TO SHEW SUCH
PLEASURE AS SHE DID, IN THE EXPECTATION AND IN THE ACTUAL ARRIVAL OF
THE VERY PERSON WHOSE PRESENCE MUST REALLY BE INTERFERING WITH HER
PRIME OBJECT.  IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE BUT THAT MRS CLAY MUST HATE THE SIGHT
OF MR ELLIOT; AND YET SHE COULD ASSUME A MOST OBLIGING, PLACID LOOK,
AND APPEAR QUITE SATISFIED WITH THE CURTAILED LICENSE OF DEVOTING
HERSELF ONLY HALF AS MUCH TO SIR WALTER AS SHE WOULD HAVE DONE
OTHERWISE.

TO ANNE HERSELF IT WAS MOST DISTRESSING TO SEE MR ELLIOT ENTER THE
ROOM; AND QUITE PAINFUL TO HAVE HIM APPROACH AND SPEAK TO HER.  SHE HAD
BEEN USED BEFORE TO FEEL THAT HE COULD NOT BE ALWAYS QUITE SINCERE, BUT
NOW SHE SAW INSINCERITY IN EVERYTHING.  HIS ATTENTIVE DEFERENCE TO HER
FATHER, CONTRASTED WITH HIS FORMER LANGUAGE, WAS ODIOUS; AND WHEN SHE
THOUGHT OF HIS CRUEL CONDUCT TOWARDS MRS SMITH, SHE COULD HARDLY BEAR
THE SIGHT OF HIS PRESENT SMILES AND MILDNESS, OR THE SOUND OF HIS
ARTIFICIAL GOOD SENTIMENTS.

SHE MEANT TO AVOID ANY SUCH ALTERATION OF MANNERS AS MIGHT PROVOKE A
REMONSTRANCE ON HIS SIDE.  IT WAS A GREAT OBJECT TO HER TO ESCAPE ALL
ENQUIRY OR ECLAT; BUT IT WAS HER INTENTION TO BE AS DECIDEDLY COOL TO
HIM AS MIGHT BE COMPATIBLE WITH THEIR RELATIONSHIP; AND TO RETRACE, AS
QUIETLY AS SHE COULD, THE FEW STEPS OF UNNECESSARY INTIMACY SHE HAD
BEEN GRADUALLY LED ALONG.  SHE WAS ACCORDINGLY MORE GUARDED, AND MORE
COOL, THAN SHE HAD BEEN THE NIGHT BEFORE.

HE WANTED TO ANIMATE HER CURIOSITY AGAIN AS TO HOW AND WHERE HE COULD
HAVE HEARD HER FORMERLY PRAISED; WANTED VERY MUCH TO BE GRATIFIED BY
MORE SOLICITATION; BUT THE CHARM WAS BROKEN: HE FOUND THAT THE HEAT AND
ANIMATION OF A PUBLIC ROOM WAS NECESSARY TO KINDLE HIS MODEST COUSIN'S
VANITY; HE FOUND, AT LEAST, THAT IT WAS NOT TO BE DONE NOW, BY ANY OF
THOSE ATTEMPTS WHICH HE COULD HAZARD AMONG THE TOO-COMMANDING CLAIMS OF
THE OTHERS.  HE LITTLE SURMISED THAT IT WAS A SUBJECT ACTING NOW
EXACTLY AGAINST HIS INTEREST, BRINGING IMMEDIATELY TO HER THOUGHTS ALL
THOSE PARTS OF HIS CONDUCT WHICH WERE LEAST EXCUSABLE.

SHE HAD SOME SATISFACTION IN FINDING THAT HE WAS REALLY GOING OUT OF
BATH THE NEXT MORNING, GOING EARLY, AND THAT HE WOULD BE GONE THE
GREATER PART OF TWO DAYS.  HE WAS INVITED AGAIN TO CAMDEN PLACE THE
VERY EVENING OF HIS RETURN; BUT FROM THURSDAY TO SATURDAY EVENING HIS
ABSENCE WAS CERTAIN.  IT WAS BAD ENOUGH THAT A MRS CLAY SHOULD BE
ALWAYS BEFORE HER; BUT THAT A DEEPER HYPOCRITE SHOULD BE ADDED TO THEIR
PARTY, SEEMED THE DESTRUCTION OF EVERYTHING LIKE PEACE AND COMFORT.  IT
WAS SO HUMILIATING TO REFLECT ON THE CONSTANT DECEPTION PRACTISED ON
HER FATHER AND ELIZABETH; TO CONSIDER THE VARIOUS SOURCES OF
MORTIFICATION PREPARING FOR THEM!  MRS CLAY'S SELFISHNESS WAS NOT SO
COMPLICATE NOR SO REVOLTING AS HIS; AND ANNE WOULD HAVE COMPOUNDED FOR
THE MARRIAGE AT ONCE, WITH ALL ITS EVILS, TO BE CLEAR OF MR ELLIOT'S
SUBTLETIES IN ENDEAVOURING TO PREVENT IT.

ON FRIDAY MORNING SHE MEANT TO GO VERY EARLY TO LADY RUSSELL, AND
ACCOMPLISH THE NECESSARY COMMUNICATION; AND SHE WOULD HAVE GONE
DIRECTLY AFTER BREAKFAST, BUT THAT MRS CLAY WAS ALSO GOING OUT ON SOME
OBLIGING PURPOSE OF SAVING HER SISTER TROUBLE, WHICH DETERMINED HER TO
WAIT TILL SHE MIGHT BE SAFE FROM SUCH A COMPANION.  SHE SAW MRS CLAY
FAIRLY OFF, THEREFORE, BEFORE SHE BEGAN TO TALK OF SPENDING THE MORNING
IN RIVERS STREET.

"VERY WELL," SAID ELIZABETH, "I HAVE NOTHING TO SEND BUT MY LOVE.  OH!
YOU MAY AS WELL TAKE BACK THAT TIRESOME BOOK SHE WOULD LEND ME, AND
PRETEND I HAVE READ IT THROUGH.  I REALLY CANNOT BE PLAGUING MYSELF FOR
EVER WITH ALL THE NEW POEMS AND STATES OF THE NATION THAT COME OUT.
LADY RUSSELL QUITE BORES ONE WITH HER NEW PUBLICATIONS.  YOU NEED NOT
TELL HER SO, BUT I THOUGHT HER DRESS HIDEOUS THE OTHER NIGHT.  I USED
TO THINK SHE HAD SOME TASTE IN DRESS, BUT I WAS ASHAMED OF HER AT THE
CONCERT.  SOMETHING SO FORMAL AND ARRANGE IN HER AIR!  AND SHE SITS SO
UPRIGHT!  MY BEST LOVE, OF COURSE."

"AND MINE," ADDED SIR WALTER.  "KINDEST REGARDS.  AND YOU MAY SAY, THAT
I MEAN TO CALL UPON HER SOON.  MAKE A CIVIL MESSAGE; BUT I SHALL ONLY
LEAVE MY CARD.  MORNING VISITS ARE NEVER FAIR BY WOMEN AT HER TIME OF
LIFE, WHO MAKE THEMSELVES UP SO LITTLE.  IF SHE WOULD ONLY WEAR ROUGE
SHE WOULD NOT BE AFRAID OF BEING SEEN; BUT LAST TIME I CALLED, I
OBSERVED THE BLINDS WERE LET DOWN IMMEDIATELY."

WHILE HER FATHER SPOKE, THERE WAS A KNOCK AT THE DOOR.  WHO COULD IT
BE?  ANNE, REMEMBERING THE PRECONCERTED VISITS, AT ALL HOURS, OF MR
ELLIOT, WOULD HAVE EXPECTED HIM, BUT FOR HIS KNOWN ENGAGEMENT SEVEN
MILES OFF.  AFTER THE USUAL PERIOD OF SUSPENSE, THE USUAL SOUNDS OF
APPROACH WERE HEARD, AND "MR AND MRS CHARLES MUSGROVE" WERE USHERED
INTO THE ROOM.

SURPRISE WAS THE STRONGEST EMOTION RAISED BY THEIR APPEARANCE; BUT ANNE
WAS REALLY GLAD TO SEE THEM; AND THE OTHERS WERE NOT SO SORRY BUT THAT
THEY COULD PUT ON A DECENT AIR OF WELCOME; AND AS SOON AS IT BECAME
CLEAR THAT THESE, THEIR NEAREST RELATIONS, WERE NOT ARRIVED WITH ANY
VIEWS OF ACCOMMODATION IN THAT HOUSE, SIR WALTER AND ELIZABETH WERE
ABLE TO RISE IN CORDIALITY, AND DO THE HONOURS OF IT VERY WELL.  THEY
WERE COME TO BATH FOR A FEW DAYS WITH MRS MUSGROVE, AND WERE AT THE
WHITE HART.  SO MUCH WAS PRETTY SOON UNDERSTOOD; BUT TILL SIR WALTER
AND ELIZABETH WERE WALKING MARY INTO THE OTHER DRAWING-ROOM, AND
REGALING THEMSELVES WITH HER ADMIRATION, ANNE COULD NOT DRAW UPON
CHARLES'S BRAIN FOR A REGULAR HISTORY OF THEIR COMING, OR AN
EXPLANATION OF SOME SMILING HINTS OF PARTICULAR BUSINESS, WHICH HAD
BEEN OSTENTATIOUSLY DROPPED BY MARY, AS WELL AS OF SOME APPARENT
CONFUSION AS TO WHOM THEIR PARTY CONSISTED OF.

SHE THEN FOUND THAT IT CONSISTED OF MRS MUSGROVE, HENRIETTA, AND
CAPTAIN HARVILLE, BESIDE THEIR TWO SELVES.  HE GAVE HER A VERY PLAIN,
INTELLIGIBLE ACCOUNT OF THE WHOLE; A NARRATION IN WHICH SHE SAW A GREAT
DEAL OF MOST CHARACTERISTIC PROCEEDING.  THE SCHEME HAD RECEIVED ITS
FIRST IMPULSE BY CAPTAIN HARVILLE'S WANTING TO COME TO BATH ON
BUSINESS.  HE HAD BEGUN TO TALK OF IT A WEEK AGO; AND BY WAY OF DOING
SOMETHING, AS SHOOTING WAS OVER, CHARLES HAD PROPOSED COMING WITH HIM,
AND MRS HARVILLE HAD SEEMED TO LIKE THE IDEA OF IT VERY MUCH, AS AN
ADVANTAGE TO HER HUSBAND; BUT MARY COULD NOT BEAR TO BE LEFT, AND HAD
MADE HERSELF SO UNHAPPY ABOUT IT, THAT FOR A DAY OR TWO EVERYTHING
SEEMED TO BE IN SUSPENSE, OR AT AN END.  BUT THEN, IT HAD BEEN TAKEN UP
BY HIS FATHER AND MOTHER.  HIS MOTHER HAD SOME OLD FRIENDS IN BATH WHOM
SHE WANTED TO SEE; IT WAS THOUGHT A GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR HENRIETTA TO
COME AND BUY WEDDING-CLOTHES FOR HERSELF AND HER SISTER; AND, IN SHORT,
IT ENDED IN BEING HIS MOTHER'S PARTY, THAT EVERYTHING MIGHT BE
COMFORTABLE AND EASY TO CAPTAIN HARVILLE; AND HE AND MARY WERE INCLUDED
IN IT BY WAY OF GENERAL CONVENIENCE.  THEY HAD ARRIVED LATE THE NIGHT
BEFORE.  MRS HARVILLE, HER CHILDREN, AND CAPTAIN BENWICK, REMAINED WITH
MR MUSGROVE AND LOUISA AT UPPERCROSS.

ANNE'S ONLY SURPRISE WAS, THAT AFFAIRS SHOULD BE IN FORWARDNESS ENOUGH
FOR HENRIETTA'S WEDDING-CLOTHES TO BE TALKED OF.  SHE HAD IMAGINED SUCH
DIFFICULTIES OF FORTUNE TO EXIST THERE AS MUST PREVENT THE MARRIAGE
FROM BEING NEAR AT HAND; BUT SHE LEARNED FROM CHARLES THAT, VERY
RECENTLY, (SINCE MARY'S LAST LETTER TO HERSELF), CHARLES HAYTER HAD
BEEN APPLIED TO BY A FRIEND TO HOLD A LIVING FOR A YOUTH WHO COULD NOT
POSSIBLY CLAIM IT UNDER MANY YEARS; AND THAT ON THE STRENGTH OF HIS
PRESENT INCOME, WITH ALMOST A CERTAINTY OF SOMETHING MORE PERMANENT
LONG BEFORE THE TERM IN QUESTION, THE TWO FAMILIES HAD CONSENTED TO THE
YOUNG PEOPLE'S WISHES, AND THAT THEIR MARRIAGE WAS LIKELY TO TAKE PLACE
IN A FEW MONTHS, QUITE AS SOON AS LOUISA'S.  "AND A VERY GOOD LIVING IT
WAS," CHARLES ADDED:  "ONLY FIVE-AND-TWENTY MILES FROM UPPERCROSS, AND
IN A VERY FINE COUNTRY: FINE PART OF DORSETSHIRE.  IN THE CENTRE OF
SOME OF THE BEST PRESERVES IN THE KINGDOM, SURROUNDED BY THREE GREAT
PROPRIETORS, EACH MORE CAREFUL AND JEALOUS THAN THE OTHER; AND TO TWO
OF THE THREE AT LEAST, CHARLES HAYTER MIGHT GET A SPECIAL
RECOMMENDATION.  NOT THAT HE WILL VALUE IT AS HE OUGHT," HE OBSERVED,
"CHARLES IS TOO COOL ABOUT SPORTING. THAT'S THE WORST OF HIM."

"I AM EXTREMELY GLAD, INDEED," CRIED ANNE, "PARTICULARLY GLAD THAT THIS
SHOULD HAPPEN; AND THAT OF TWO SISTERS, WHO BOTH DESERVE EQUALLY WELL,
AND WHO HAVE ALWAYS BEEN SUCH GOOD FRIENDS, THE PLEASANT PROSPECT OF
ONE SHOULD NOT BE DIMMING THOSE OF THE OTHER--THAT THEY SHOULD BE SO
EQUAL IN THEIR PROSPERITY AND COMFORT.  I HOPE YOUR FATHER AND MOTHER
ARE QUITE HAPPY WITH REGARD TO BOTH."

"OH! YES.  MY FATHER WOULD BE WELL PLEASED IF THE GENTLEMEN WERE
RICHER, BUT HE HAS NO OTHER FAULT TO FIND.  MONEY, YOU KNOW, COMING
DOWN WITH MONEY--TWO DAUGHTERS AT ONCE--IT CANNOT BE A VERY AGREEABLE
OPERATION, AND IT STREIGHTENS HIM AS TO MANY THINGS.  HOWEVER, I DO NOT
MEAN TO SAY THEY HAVE NOT A RIGHT TO IT.  IT IS VERY FIT THEY SHOULD
HAVE DAUGHTERS' SHARES; AND I AM SURE HE HAS ALWAYS BEEN A VERY KIND,
LIBERAL FATHER TO ME.  MARY DOES NOT ABOVE HALF LIKE HENRIETTA'S MATCH.
SHE NEVER DID, YOU KNOW.  BUT SHE DOES NOT DO HIM JUSTICE, NOR THINK
ENOUGH ABOUT WINTHROP.  I CANNOT MAKE HER ATTEND TO THE VALUE OF THE
PROPERTY.  IT IS A VERY FAIR MATCH, AS TIMES GO; AND I HAVE LIKED
CHARLES HAYTER ALL MY LIFE, AND I SHALL NOT LEAVE OFF NOW."

"SUCH EXCELLENT PARENTS AS MR AND MRS MUSGROVE," EXCLAIMED ANNE,
"SHOULD BE HAPPY IN THEIR CHILDREN'S MARRIAGES.  THEY DO EVERYTHING TO
CONFER HAPPINESS, I AM SURE.  WHAT A BLESSING TO YOUNG PEOPLE TO BE IN
SUCH HANDS!  YOUR FATHER AND MOTHER SEEM SO TOTALLY FREE FROM ALL THOSE
AMBITIOUS FEELINGS WHICH HAVE LED TO SO MUCH MISCONDUCT AND MISERY,
BOTH IN YOUNG AND OLD.  I HOPE YOU THINK LOUISA PERFECTLY RECOVERED
NOW?"

HE ANSWERED RATHER HESITATINGLY, "YES, I BELIEVE I DO; VERY MUCH
RECOVERED; BUT SHE IS ALTERED; THERE IS NO RUNNING OR JUMPING ABOUT, NO
LAUGHING OR DANCING; IT IS QUITE DIFFERENT.  IF ONE HAPPENS ONLY TO
SHUT THE DOOR A LITTLE HARD, SHE STARTS AND WRIGGLES LIKE A YOUNG
DAB-CHICK IN THE WATER; AND BENWICK SITS AT HER ELBOW, READING VERSES,
OR WHISPERING TO HER, ALL DAY LONG."

ANNE COULD NOT HELP LAUGHING.  "THAT CANNOT BE MUCH TO YOUR TASTE, I
KNOW," SAID SHE; "BUT I DO BELIEVE HIM TO BE AN EXCELLENT YOUNG MAN."

"TO BE SURE HE IS.  NOBODY DOUBTS IT; AND I HOPE YOU DO NOT THINK I AM
SO ILLIBERAL AS TO WANT EVERY MAN TO HAVE THE SAME OBJECTS AND
PLEASURES AS MYSELF.  I HAVE A GREAT VALUE FOR BENWICK; AND WHEN ONE
CAN BUT GET HIM TO TALK, HE HAS PLENTY TO SAY.  HIS READING HAS DONE
HIM NO HARM, FOR HE HAS FOUGHT AS WELL AS READ.  HE IS A BRAVE FELLOW.
I GOT MORE ACQUAINTED WITH HIM LAST MONDAY THAN EVER I DID BEFORE.  WE
HAD A FAMOUS SET-TO AT RAT-HUNTING ALL THE MORNING IN MY FATHER'S GREAT
BARNS; AND HE PLAYED HIS PART SO WELL THAT I HAVE LIKED HIM THE BETTER
EVER SINCE."

HERE THEY WERE INTERRUPTED BY THE ABSOLUTE NECESSITY OF CHARLES'S
FOLLOWING THE OTHERS TO ADMIRE MIRRORS AND CHINA; BUT ANNE HAD HEARD
ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND THE PRESENT STATE OF UPPERCROSS, AND REJOICE IN
ITS HAPPINESS; AND THOUGH SHE SIGHED AS SHE REJOICED, HER SIGH HAD NONE
OF THE ILL-WILL OF ENVY IN IT.  SHE WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE RISEN TO THEIR
BLESSINGS IF SHE COULD, BUT SHE DID NOT WANT TO LESSEN THEIRS.

THE VISIT PASSED OFF ALTOGETHER IN HIGH GOOD HUMOUR.  MARY WAS IN
EXCELLENT SPIRITS, ENJOYING THE GAIETY AND THE CHANGE, AND SO WELL
SATISFIED WITH THE JOURNEY IN HER MOTHER-IN-LAW'S CARRIAGE WITH FOUR
HORSES, AND WITH HER OWN COMPLETE INDEPENDENCE OF CAMDEN PLACE, THAT
SHE WAS EXACTLY IN A TEMPER TO ADMIRE EVERYTHING AS SHE OUGHT, AND
ENTER MOST READILY INTO ALL THE SUPERIORITIES OF THE HOUSE, AS THEY
WERE DETAILED TO HER.  SHE HAD NO DEMANDS ON HER FATHER OR SISTER, AND
HER CONSEQUENCE WAS JUST ENOUGH INCREASED BY THEIR HANDSOME
DRAWING-ROOMS.

ELIZABETH WAS, FOR A SHORT TIME, SUFFERING A GOOD DEAL.  SHE FELT THAT
MRS MUSGROVE AND ALL HER PARTY OUGHT TO BE ASKED TO DINE WITH THEM; BUT
SHE COULD NOT BEAR TO HAVE THE DIFFERENCE OF STYLE, THE REDUCTION OF
SERVANTS, WHICH A DINNER MUST BETRAY, WITNESSED BY THOSE WHO HAD BEEN
ALWAYS SO INFERIOR TO THE ELLIOTS OF KELLYNCH.  IT WAS A STRUGGLE
BETWEEN PROPRIETY AND VANITY; BUT VANITY GOT THE BETTER, AND THEN
ELIZABETH WAS HAPPY AGAIN.  THESE WERE HER INTERNAL PERSUASIONS: "OLD
FASHIONED NOTIONS; COUNTRY HOSPITALITY; WE DO NOT PROFESS TO GIVE
DINNERS; FEW PEOPLE IN BATH DO; LADY ALICIA NEVER DOES; DID NOT EVEN
ASK HER OWN SISTER'S FAMILY, THOUGH THEY WERE HERE A MONTH: AND I DARE
SAY IT WOULD BE VERY INCONVENIENT TO MRS MUSGROVE; PUT HER QUITE OUT OF
HER WAY.  I AM SURE SHE WOULD RATHER NOT COME; SHE CANNOT FEEL EASY
WITH US.  I WILL ASK THEM ALL FOR AN EVENING; THAT WILL BE MUCH BETTER;
THAT WILL BE A NOVELTY AND A TREAT.  THEY HAVE NOT SEEN TWO SUCH
DRAWING ROOMS BEFORE.  THEY WILL BE DELIGHTED TO COME TO-MORROW
EVENING.  IT SHALL BE A REGULAR PARTY, SMALL, BUT MOST ELEGANT."  AND
THIS SATISFIED ELIZABETH:  AND WHEN THE INVITATION WAS GIVEN TO THE TWO
PRESENT, AND PROMISED FOR THE ABSENT, MARY WAS AS COMPLETELY SATISFIED.
SHE WAS PARTICULARLY ASKED TO MEET MR ELLIOT, AND BE INTRODUCED TO LADY
DALRYMPLE AND MISS CARTERET, WHO WERE FORTUNATELY ALREADY ENGAGED TO
COME; AND SHE COULD NOT HAVE RECEIVED A MORE GRATIFYING ATTENTION.
MISS ELLIOT WAS TO HAVE THE HONOUR OF CALLING ON MRS MUSGROVE IN THE
COURSE OF THE MORNING; AND ANNE WALKED OFF WITH CHARLES AND MARY, TO GO
AND SEE HER AND HENRIETTA DIRECTLY.

HER PLAN OF SITTING WITH LADY RUSSELL MUST GIVE WAY FOR THE PRESENT.
THEY ALL THREE CALLED IN RIVERS STREET FOR A COUPLE OF MINUTES; BUT
ANNE CONVINCED HERSELF THAT A DAY'S DELAY OF THE INTENDED COMMUNICATION
COULD BE OF NO CONSEQUENCE, AND HASTENED FORWARD TO THE WHITE HART, TO
SEE AGAIN THE FRIENDS AND COMPANIONS OF THE LAST AUTUMN, WITH AN
EAGERNESS OF GOOD-WILL WHICH MANY ASSOCIATIONS CONTRIBUTED TO FORM.

THEY FOUND MRS MUSGROVE AND HER DAUGHTER WITHIN, AND BY THEMSELVES, AND
ANNE HAD THE KINDEST WELCOME FROM EACH.  HENRIETTA WAS EXACTLY IN THAT
STATE OF RECENTLY-IMPROVED VIEWS, OF FRESH-FORMED HAPPINESS, WHICH MADE
HER FULL OF REGARD AND INTEREST FOR EVERYBODY SHE HAD EVER LIKED BEFORE
AT ALL; AND MRS MUSGROVE'S REAL AFFECTION HAD BEEN WON BY HER
USEFULNESS WHEN THEY WERE IN DISTRESS.  IT WAS A HEARTINESS, AND A
WARMTH, AND A SINCERITY WHICH ANNE DELIGHTED IN THE MORE, FROM THE SAD
WANT OF SUCH BLESSINGS AT HOME.  SHE WAS ENTREATED TO GIVE THEM AS MUCH
OF HER TIME AS POSSIBLE, INVITED FOR EVERY DAY AND ALL DAY LONG, OR
RATHER CLAIMED AS PART OF THE FAMILY; AND, IN RETURN, SHE NATURALLY
FELL INTO ALL HER WONTED WAYS OF ATTENTION AND ASSISTANCE, AND ON
CHARLES'S LEAVING THEM TOGETHER, WAS LISTENING TO MRS MUSGROVE'S
HISTORY OF LOUISA, AND TO HENRIETTA'S OF HERSELF, GIVING OPINIONS ON
BUSINESS, AND RECOMMENDATIONS TO SHOPS; WITH INTERVALS OF EVERY HELP
WHICH MARY REQUIRED, FROM ALTERING HER RIBBON TO SETTLING HER ACCOUNTS;
FROM FINDING HER KEYS, AND ASSORTING HER TRINKETS, TO TRYING TO
CONVINCE HER THAT SHE WAS NOT ILL-USED BY ANYBODY; WHICH MARY, WELL
AMUSED AS SHE GENERALLY WAS, IN HER STATION AT A WINDOW OVERLOOKING THE
ENTRANCE TO THE PUMP ROOM, COULD NOT BUT HAVE HER MOMENTS OF IMAGINING.

A MORNING OF THOROUGH CONFUSION WAS TO BE EXPECTED.  A LARGE PARTY IN
AN HOTEL ENSURED A QUICK-CHANGING, UNSETTLED SCENE.  ONE FIVE MINUTES
BROUGHT A NOTE, THE NEXT A PARCEL; AND ANNE HAD NOT BEEN THERE HALF AN
HOUR, WHEN THEIR DINING-ROOM, SPACIOUS AS IT WAS, SEEMED MORE THAN HALF
FILLED:  A PARTY OF STEADY OLD FRIENDS WERE SEATED AROUND MRS MUSGROVE,
AND CHARLES CAME BACK WITH CAPTAINS HARVILLE AND WENTWORTH.  THE
APPEARANCE OF THE LATTER COULD NOT BE MORE THAN THE SURPRISE OF THE
MOMENT.  IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HER TO HAVE FORGOTTEN TO FEEL THAT THIS
ARRIVAL OF THEIR COMMON FRIENDS MUST BE SOON BRINGING THEM TOGETHER
AGAIN.  THEIR LAST MEETING HAD BEEN MOST IMPORTANT IN OPENING HIS
FEELINGS; SHE HAD DERIVED FROM IT A DELIGHTFUL CONVICTION; BUT SHE
FEARED FROM HIS LOOKS, THAT THE SAME UNFORTUNATE PERSUASION, WHICH HAD
HASTENED HIM AWAY FROM THE CONCERT ROOM, STILL GOVERNED.  HE DID NOT
SEEM TO WANT TO BE NEAR ENOUGH FOR CONVERSATION.

SHE TRIED TO BE CALM, AND LEAVE THINGS TO TAKE THEIR COURSE, AND TRIED
TO DWELL MUCH ON THIS ARGUMENT OF RATIONAL DEPENDENCE:--"SURELY, IF
THERE BE CONSTANT ATTACHMENT ON EACH SIDE, OUR HEARTS MUST UNDERSTAND
EACH OTHER ERE LONG.  WE ARE NOT BOY AND GIRL, TO BE CAPTIOUSLY
IRRITABLE, MISLED BY EVERY MOMENT'S INADVERTENCE, AND WANTONLY PLAYING
WITH OUR OWN HAPPINESS."  AND YET, A FEW MINUTES AFTERWARDS, SHE FELT
AS IF THEIR BEING IN COMPANY WITH EACH OTHER, UNDER THEIR PRESENT
CIRCUMSTANCES, COULD ONLY BE EXPOSING THEM TO INADVERTENCIES AND
MISCONSTRUCTIONS OF THE MOST MISCHIEVOUS KIND.

"ANNE," CRIED MARY, STILL AT HER WINDOW, "THERE IS MRS CLAY, I AM SURE,
STANDING UNDER THE COLONNADE, AND A GENTLEMAN WITH HER.  I SAW THEM
TURN THE CORNER FROM BATH STREET JUST NOW.  THEY SEEMED DEEP IN TALK.
WHO IS IT?  COME, AND TELL ME.  GOOD HEAVENS! I RECOLLECT.  IT IS MR
ELLIOT HIMSELF."

"NO," CRIED ANNE, QUICKLY, "IT CANNOT BE MR ELLIOT, I ASSURE YOU.  HE
WAS TO LEAVE BATH AT NINE THIS MORNING, AND DOES NOT COME BACK TILL
TO-MORROW."

AS SHE SPOKE, SHE FELT THAT CAPTAIN WENTWORTH WAS LOOKING AT HER, THE
CONSCIOUSNESS OF WHICH VEXED AND EMBARRASSED HER, AND MADE HER REGRET
THAT SHE HAD SAID SO MUCH, SIMPLE AS IT WAS.

MARY, RESENTING THAT SHE SHOULD BE SUPPOSED NOT TO KNOW HER OWN COUSIN,
BEGAN TALKING VERY WARMLY ABOUT THE FAMILY FEATURES, AND PROTESTING
STILL MORE POSITIVELY THAT IT WAS MR ELLIOT, CALLING AGAIN UPON ANNE TO
COME AND LOOK FOR HERSELF, BUT ANNE DID NOT MEAN TO STIR, AND TRIED TO
BE COOL AND UNCONCERNED.  HER DISTRESS RETURNED, HOWEVER, ON PERCEIVING
SMILES AND INTELLIGENT GLANCES PASS BETWEEN TWO OR THREE OF THE LADY
VISITORS, AS IF THEY BELIEVED THEMSELVES QUITE IN THE SECRET.  IT WAS
EVIDENT THAT THE REPORT CONCERNING HER HAD SPREAD, AND A SHORT PAUSE
SUCCEEDED, WHICH SEEMED TO ENSURE THAT IT WOULD NOW SPREAD FARTHER.

"DO COME, ANNE" CRIED MARY, "COME AND LOOK YOURSELF.  YOU WILL BE TOO
LATE IF YOU DO NOT MAKE HASTE.  THEY ARE PARTING; THEY ARE SHAKING
HANDS.  HE IS TURNING AWAY.  NOT KNOW MR ELLIOT, INDEED!  YOU SEEM TO
HAVE FORGOT ALL ABOUT LYME."

TO PACIFY MARY, AND PERHAPS SCREEN HER OWN EMBARRASSMENT, ANNE DID MOVE
QUIETLY TO THE WINDOW.  SHE WAS JUST IN TIME TO ASCERTAIN THAT IT
REALLY WAS MR ELLIOT, WHICH SHE HAD NEVER BELIEVED, BEFORE HE
DISAPPEARED ON ONE SIDE, AS MRS CLAY WALKED QUICKLY OFF ON THE OTHER;
AND CHECKING THE SURPRISE WHICH SHE COULD NOT BUT FEEL AT SUCH AN
APPEARANCE OF FRIENDLY CONFERENCE BETWEEN TWO PERSONS OF TOTALLY
OPPOSITE INTEREST, SHE CALMLY SAID, "YES, IT IS MR ELLIOT, CERTAINLY.
HE HAS CHANGED HIS HOUR OF GOING, I SUPPOSE, THAT IS ALL, OR I MAY BE
MISTAKEN, I MIGHT NOT ATTEND;" AND WALKED BACK TO HER CHAIR,
RECOMPOSED, AND WITH THE COMFORTABLE HOPE OF HAVING ACQUITTED HERSELF
WELL.

THE VISITORS TOOK THEIR LEAVE; AND CHARLES, HAVING CIVILLY SEEN THEM
OFF, AND THEN MADE A FACE AT THEM, AND ABUSED THEM FOR COMING, BEGAN
WITH--

"WELL, MOTHER, I HAVE DONE SOMETHING FOR YOU THAT YOU WILL LIKE.  I
HAVE BEEN TO THE THEATRE, AND SECURED A BOX FOR TO-MORROW NIGHT.  A'N'T
I A GOOD BOY?  I KNOW YOU LOVE A PLAY; AND THERE IS ROOM FOR US ALL.
IT HOLDS NINE.  I HAVE ENGAGED CAPTAIN WENTWORTH.  ANNE WILL NOT BE
SORRY TO JOIN US, I AM SURE.  WE ALL LIKE A PLAY.  HAVE NOT I DONE
WELL, MOTHER?"

MRS MUSGROVE WAS GOOD HUMOUREDLY BEGINNING TO EXPRESS HER PERFECT
READINESS FOR THE PLAY, IF HENRIETTA AND ALL THE OTHERS LIKED IT, WHEN
MARY EAGERLY INTERRUPTED HER BY EXCLAIMING--

"GOOD HEAVENS, CHARLES! HOW CAN YOU THINK OF SUCH A THING?  TAKE A BOX
FOR TO-MORROW NIGHT!  HAVE YOU FORGOT THAT WE ARE ENGAGED TO CAMDEN
PLACE TO-MORROW NIGHT? AND THAT WE WERE MOST PARTICULARLY ASKED TO MEET
LADY DALRYMPLE AND HER DAUGHTER, AND MR ELLIOT, AND ALL THE PRINCIPAL
FAMILY CONNEXIONS, ON PURPOSE TO BE INTRODUCED TO THEM?  HOW CAN YOU BE
SO FORGETFUL?"

"PHOO! PHOO!" REPLIED CHARLES, "WHAT'S AN EVENING PARTY?  NEVER WORTH
REMEMBERING.  YOUR FATHER MIGHT HAVE ASKED US TO DINNER, I THINK, IF HE
HAD WANTED TO SEE US.  YOU MAY DO AS YOU LIKE, BUT I SHALL GO TO THE
PLAY."

"OH! CHARLES, I DECLARE IT WILL BE TOO ABOMINABLE IF YOU DO, WHEN YOU
PROMISED TO GO."

"NO, I DID NOT PROMISE.  I ONLY SMIRKED AND BOWED, AND SAID THE WORD
'HAPPY.'  THERE WAS NO PROMISE."

"BUT YOU MUST GO, CHARLES.  IT WOULD BE UNPARDONABLE TO FAIL.  WE WERE
ASKED ON PURPOSE TO BE INTRODUCED.  THERE WAS ALWAYS SUCH A GREAT
CONNEXION BETWEEN THE DALRYMPLES AND OURSELVES.  NOTHING EVER HAPPENED
ON EITHER SIDE THAT WAS NOT ANNOUNCED IMMEDIATELY.  WE ARE QUITE NEAR
RELATIONS, YOU KNOW; AND MR ELLIOT TOO, WHOM YOU OUGHT SO PARTICULARLY
TO BE ACQUAINTED WITH!  EVERY ATTENTION IS DUE TO MR ELLIOT.  CONSIDER,
MY FATHER'S HEIR:  THE FUTURE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE FAMILY."

"DON'T TALK TO ME ABOUT HEIRS AND REPRESENTATIVES," CRIED CHARLES.  "I
AM NOT ONE OF THOSE WHO NEGLECT THE REIGNING POWER TO BOW TO THE RISING
SUN.  IF I WOULD NOT GO FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR FATHER, I SHOULD THINK IT
SCANDALOUS TO GO FOR THE SAKE OF HIS HEIR.  WHAT IS MR ELLIOT TO ME?"
THE CARELESS EXPRESSION WAS LIFE TO ANNE, WHO SAW THAT CAPTAIN
WENTWORTH WAS ALL ATTENTION, LOOKING AND LISTENING WITH HIS WHOLE SOUL;
AND THAT THE LAST WORDS BROUGHT HIS ENQUIRING EYES FROM CHARLES TO
HERSELF.

CHARLES AND MARY STILL TALKED ON IN THE SAME STYLE; HE, HALF SERIOUS
AND HALF JESTING, MAINTAINING THE SCHEME FOR THE PLAY, AND SHE,
INVARIABLY SERIOUS, MOST WARMLY OPPOSING IT, AND NOT OMITTING TO MAKE
IT KNOWN THAT, HOWEVER DETERMINED TO GO TO CAMDEN PLACE HERSELF, SHE
SHOULD NOT THINK HERSELF VERY WELL USED, IF THEY WENT TO THE PLAY
WITHOUT HER.  MRS MUSGROVE INTERPOSED.

"WE HAD BETTER PUT IT OFF.  CHARLES, YOU HAD MUCH BETTER GO BACK AND
CHANGE THE BOX FOR TUESDAY.  IT WOULD BE A PITY TO BE DIVIDED, AND WE
SHOULD BE LOSING MISS ANNE, TOO, IF THERE IS A PARTY AT HER FATHER'S;
AND I AM SURE NEITHER HENRIETTA NOR I SHOULD CARE AT ALL FOR THE PLAY,
IF MISS ANNE COULD NOT BE WITH US."

ANNE FELT TRULY OBLIGED TO HER FOR SUCH KINDNESS; AND QUITE AS MUCH SO
FOR THE OPPORTUNITY IT GAVE HER OF DECIDEDLY SAYING--

"IF IT DEPENDED ONLY ON MY INCLINATION, MA'AM, THE PARTY AT HOME
(EXCEPTING ON MARY'S ACCOUNT) WOULD NOT BE THE SMALLEST IMPEDIMENT.  I
HAVE NO PLEASURE IN THE SORT OF MEETING, AND SHOULD BE TOO HAPPY TO
CHANGE IT FOR A PLAY, AND WITH YOU.  BUT, IT HAD BETTER NOT BE
ATTEMPTED, PERHAPS."  SHE HAD SPOKEN IT; BUT SHE TREMBLED WHEN IT WAS
DONE, CONSCIOUS THAT HER WORDS WERE LISTENED TO, AND DARING NOT EVEN TO
TRY TO OBSERVE THEIR EFFECT.

IT WAS SOON GENERALLY AGREED THAT TUESDAY SHOULD BE THE DAY; CHARLES
ONLY RESERVING THE ADVANTAGE OF STILL TEASING HIS WIFE, BY PERSISTING
THAT HE WOULD GO TO THE PLAY TO-MORROW IF NOBODY ELSE WOULD.

CAPTAIN WENTWORTH LEFT HIS SEAT, AND WALKED TO THE FIRE-PLACE; PROBABLY
FOR THE SAKE OF WALKING AWAY FROM IT SOON AFTERWARDS, AND TAKING A
STATION, WITH LESS BARE-FACED DESIGN, BY ANNE.

"YOU HAVE NOT BEEN LONG ENOUGH IN BATH," SAID HE, "TO ENJOY THE EVENING
PARTIES OF THE PLACE."

"OH! NO.  THE USUAL CHARACTER OF THEM HAS NOTHING FOR ME.  I AM NO
CARD-PLAYER."

"YOU WERE NOT FORMERLY, I KNOW.  YOU DID NOT USE TO LIKE CARDS; BUT
TIME MAKES MANY CHANGES."

"I AM NOT YET SO MUCH CHANGED," CRIED ANNE, AND STOPPED, FEARING SHE
HARDLY KNEW WHAT MISCONSTRUCTION.  AFTER WAITING A FEW MOMENTS HE SAID,
AND AS IF IT WERE THE RESULT OF IMMEDIATE FEELING, "IT IS A PERIOD,
INDEED!  EIGHT YEARS AND A HALF IS A PERIOD."

WHETHER HE WOULD HAVE PROCEEDED FARTHER WAS LEFT TO ANNE'S IMAGINATION
TO PONDER OVER IN A CALMER HOUR; FOR WHILE STILL HEARING THE SOUNDS HE
HAD UTTERED, SHE WAS STARTLED TO OTHER SUBJECTS BY HENRIETTA, EAGER TO
MAKE USE OF THE PRESENT LEISURE FOR GETTING OUT, AND CALLING ON HER
COMPANIONS TO LOSE NO TIME, LEST SOMEBODY ELSE SHOULD COME IN.

THEY WERE OBLIGED TO MOVE.  ANNE TALKED OF BEING PERFECTLY READY, AND
TRIED TO LOOK IT; BUT SHE FELT THAT COULD HENRIETTA HAVE KNOWN THE
REGRET AND RELUCTANCE OF HER HEART IN QUITTING THAT CHAIR, IN PREPARING
TO QUIT THE ROOM, SHE WOULD HAVE FOUND, IN ALL HER OWN SENSATIONS FOR
HER COUSIN, IN THE VERY SECURITY OF HIS AFFECTION, WHEREWITH TO PITY
HER.

THEIR PREPARATIONS, HOWEVER, WERE STOPPED SHORT.  ALARMING SOUNDS WERE
HEARD; OTHER VISITORS APPROACHED, AND THE DOOR WAS THROWN OPEN FOR SIR
WALTER AND MISS ELLIOT, WHOSE ENTRANCE SEEMED TO GIVE A GENERAL CHILL.
ANNE FELT AN INSTANT OPPRESSION, AND WHEREVER SHE LOOKED SAW SYMPTOMS
OF THE SAME.  THE COMFORT, THE FREEDOM, THE GAIETY OF THE ROOM WAS
OVER, HUSHED INTO COLD COMPOSURE, DETERMINED SILENCE, OR INSIPID TALK,
TO MEET THE HEARTLESS ELEGANCE OF HER FATHER AND SISTER.  HOW
MORTIFYING TO FEEL THAT IT WAS SO!

HER JEALOUS EYE WAS SATISFIED IN ONE PARTICULAR.  CAPTAIN WENTWORTH WAS
ACKNOWLEDGED AGAIN BY EACH, BY ELIZABETH MORE GRACIOUSLY THAN BEFORE.
SHE EVEN ADDRESSED HIM ONCE, AND LOOKED AT HIM MORE THAN ONCE.
ELIZABETH WAS, IN FACT, REVOLVING A GREAT MEASURE.  THE SEQUEL
EXPLAINED IT.  AFTER THE WASTE OF A FEW MINUTES IN SAYING THE PROPER
NOTHINGS, SHE BEGAN TO GIVE THE INVITATION WHICH WAS TO COMPRISE ALL
THE REMAINING DUES OF THE MUSGROVES.  "TO-MORROW EVENING, TO MEET A FEW
FRIENDS:  NO FORMAL PARTY." IT WAS ALL SAID VERY GRACEFULLY, AND THE
CARDS WITH WHICH SHE HAD PROVIDED HERSELF, THE "MISS ELLIOT AT HOME,"
WERE LAID ON THE TABLE, WITH A COURTEOUS, COMPREHENSIVE SMILE TO ALL,
AND ONE SMILE AND ONE CARD MORE DECIDEDLY FOR CAPTAIN WENTWORTH.  THE
TRUTH WAS, THAT ELIZABETH HAD BEEN LONG ENOUGH IN BATH TO UNDERSTAND
THE IMPORTANCE OF A MAN OF SUCH AN AIR AND APPEARANCE AS HIS.  THE PAST
WAS NOTHING.  THE PRESENT WAS THAT CAPTAIN WENTWORTH WOULD MOVE ABOUT
WELL IN HER DRAWING-ROOM.  THE CARD WAS POINTEDLY GIVEN, AND SIR WALTER
AND ELIZABETH AROSE AND DISAPPEARED.

THE INTERRUPTION HAD BEEN SHORT, THOUGH SEVERE, AND EASE AND ANIMATION
RETURNED TO MOST OF THOSE THEY LEFT AS THE DOOR SHUT THEM OUT, BUT NOT
TO ANNE.  SHE COULD THINK ONLY OF THE INVITATION SHE HAD WITH SUCH
ASTONISHMENT WITNESSED, AND OF THE MANNER IN WHICH IT HAD BEEN
RECEIVED; A MANNER OF DOUBTFUL MEANING, OF SURPRISE RATHER THAN
GRATIFICATION, OF POLITE ACKNOWLEDGEMENT RATHER THAN ACCEPTANCE.  SHE
KNEW HIM; SHE SAW DISDAIN IN HIS EYE, AND COULD NOT VENTURE TO BELIEVE
THAT HE HAD DETERMINED TO ACCEPT SUCH AN OFFERING, AS AN ATONEMENT FOR
ALL THE INSOLENCE OF THE PAST.  HER SPIRITS SANK.  HE HELD THE CARD IN
HIS HAND AFTER THEY WERE GONE, AS IF DEEPLY CONSIDERING IT.

"ONLY THINK OF ELIZABETH'S INCLUDING EVERYBODY!" WHISPERED MARY VERY
AUDIBLY.  "I DO NOT WONDER CAPTAIN WENTWORTH IS DELIGHTED!  YOU SEE HE
CANNOT PUT THE CARD OUT OF HIS HAND."

ANNE CAUGHT HIS EYE, SAW HIS CHEEKS GLOW, AND HIS MOUTH FORM ITSELF
INTO A MOMENTARY EXPRESSION OF CONTEMPT, AND TURNED AWAY, THAT SHE
MIGHT NEITHER SEE NOR HEAR MORE TO VEX HER.

THE PARTY SEPARATED.  THE GENTLEMEN HAD THEIR OWN PURSUITS, THE LADIES
PROCEEDED ON THEIR OWN BUSINESS, AND THEY MET NO MORE WHILE ANNE
BELONGED TO THEM.  SHE WAS EARNESTLY BEGGED TO RETURN AND DINE, AND
GIVE THEM ALL THE REST OF THE DAY, BUT HER SPIRITS HAD BEEN SO LONG
EXERTED THAT AT PRESENT SHE FELT UNEQUAL TO MORE, AND FIT ONLY FOR
HOME, WHERE SHE MIGHT BE SURE OF BEING AS SILENT AS SHE CHOSE.

PROMISING TO BE WITH THEM THE WHOLE OF THE FOLLOWING MORNING,
THEREFORE, SHE CLOSED THE FATIGUES OF THE PRESENT BY A TOILSOME WALK TO
CAMDEN PLACE, THERE TO SPEND THE EVENING CHIEFLY IN LISTENING TO THE
BUSY ARRANGEMENTS OF ELIZABETH AND MRS CLAY FOR THE MORROW'S PARTY, THE
FREQUENT ENUMERATION OF THE PERSONS INVITED, AND THE CONTINUALLY
IMPROVING DETAIL OF ALL THE EMBELLISHMENTS WHICH WERE TO MAKE IT THE
MOST COMPLETELY ELEGANT OF ITS KIND IN BATH, WHILE HARASSING HERSELF
WITH THE NEVER-ENDING QUESTION, OF WHETHER CAPTAIN WENTWORTH WOULD COME
OR NOT?  THEY WERE RECKONING HIM AS CERTAIN, BUT WITH HER IT WAS A
GNAWING SOLICITUDE NEVER APPEASED FOR FIVE MINUTES TOGETHER.  SHE
GENERALLY THOUGHT HE WOULD COME, BECAUSE SHE GENERALLY THOUGHT HE
OUGHT; BUT IT WAS A CASE WHICH SHE COULD NOT SO SHAPE INTO ANY POSITIVE
ACT OF DUTY OR DISCRETION, AS INEVITABLY TO DEFY THE SUGGESTIONS OF
VERY OPPOSITE FEELINGS.

SHE ONLY ROUSED HERSELF FROM THE BROODINGS OF THIS RESTLESS AGITATION,
TO LET MRS CLAY KNOW THAT SHE HAD BEEN SEEN WITH MR ELLIOT THREE HOURS
AFTER HIS BEING SUPPOSED TO BE OUT OF BATH, FOR HAVING WATCHED IN VAIN
FOR SOME INTIMATION OF THE INTERVIEW FROM THE LADY HERSELF, SHE
DETERMINED TO MENTION IT, AND IT SEEMED TO HER THERE WAS GUILT IN MRS
CLAY'S FACE AS SHE LISTENED.  IT WAS TRANSIENT: CLEARED AWAY IN AN
INSTANT; BUT ANNE COULD IMAGINE SHE READ THERE THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF
HAVING, BY SOME COMPLICATION OF MUTUAL TRICK, OR SOME OVERBEARING
AUTHORITY OF HIS, BEEN OBLIGED TO ATTEND (PERHAPS FOR HALF AN HOUR) TO
HIS LECTURES AND RESTRICTIONS ON HER DESIGNS ON SIR WALTER.  SHE
EXCLAIMED, HOWEVER, WITH A VERY TOLERABLE IMITATION OF NATURE:--

"OH! DEAR! VERY TRUE.  ONLY THINK, MISS ELLIOT, TO MY GREAT SURPRISE I
MET WITH MR ELLIOT IN BATH STREET.  I WAS NEVER MORE ASTONISHED.  HE
TURNED BACK AND WALKED WITH ME TO THE PUMP YARD.  HE HAD BEEN PREVENTED
SETTING OFF FOR THORNBERRY, BUT I REALLY FORGET BY WHAT; FOR I WAS IN A
HURRY, AND COULD NOT MUCH ATTEND, AND I CAN ONLY ANSWER FOR HIS BEING
DETERMINED NOT TO BE DELAYED IN HIS RETURN.  HE WANTED TO KNOW HOW
EARLY HE MIGHT BE ADMITTED TO-MORROW.  HE WAS FULL OF 'TO-MORROW,' AND
IT IS VERY EVIDENT THAT I HAVE BEEN FULL OF IT TOO, EVER SINCE I
ENTERED THE HOUSE, AND LEARNT THE EXTENSION OF YOUR PLAN AND ALL THAT
HAD HAPPENED, OR MY SEEING HIM COULD NEVER HAVE GONE SO ENTIRELY OUT OF
MY HEAD."



CHAPTER 23


ONE DAY ONLY HAD PASSED SINCE ANNE'S CONVERSATION WITH MRS SMITH; BUT A
KEENER INTEREST HAD SUCCEEDED, AND SHE WAS NOW SO LITTLE TOUCHED BY MR
ELLIOT'S CONDUCT, EXCEPT BY ITS EFFECTS IN ONE QUARTER, THAT IT BECAME
A MATTER OF COURSE THE NEXT MORNING, STILL TO DEFER HER EXPLANATORY
VISIT IN RIVERS STREET.  SHE HAD PROMISED TO BE WITH THE MUSGROVES FROM
BREAKFAST TO DINNER.  HER FAITH WAS PLIGHTED, AND MR ELLIOT'S
CHARACTER, LIKE THE SULTANESS SCHEHERAZADE'S HEAD, MUST LIVE ANOTHER
DAY.

SHE COULD NOT KEEP HER APPOINTMENT PUNCTUALLY, HOWEVER; THE WEATHER WAS
UNFAVOURABLE, AND SHE HAD GRIEVED OVER THE RAIN ON HER FRIENDS'
ACCOUNT, AND FELT IT VERY MUCH ON HER OWN, BEFORE SHE WAS ABLE TO
ATTEMPT THE WALK.  WHEN SHE REACHED THE WHITE HART, AND MADE HER WAY TO
THE PROPER APARTMENT, SHE FOUND HERSELF NEITHER ARRIVING QUITE IN TIME,
NOR THE FIRST TO ARRIVE.  THE PARTY BEFORE HER WERE, MRS MUSGROVE,
TALKING TO MRS CROFT, AND CAPTAIN HARVILLE TO CAPTAIN WENTWORTH; AND
SHE IMMEDIATELY HEARD THAT MARY AND HENRIETTA, TOO IMPATIENT TO WAIT,
HAD GONE OUT THE MOMENT IT HAD CLEARED, BUT WOULD BE BACK AGAIN SOON,
AND THAT THE STRICTEST INJUNCTIONS HAD BEEN LEFT WITH MRS MUSGROVE TO
KEEP HER THERE TILL THEY RETURNED.  SHE HAD ONLY TO SUBMIT, SIT DOWN,
BE OUTWARDLY COMPOSED, AND FEEL HERSELF PLUNGED AT ONCE IN ALL THE
AGITATIONS WHICH SHE HAD MERELY LAID HER ACCOUNT OF TASTING A LITTLE
BEFORE THE MORNING CLOSED.  THERE WAS NO DELAY, NO WASTE OF TIME.  SHE
WAS DEEP IN THE HAPPINESS OF SUCH MISERY, OR THE MISERY OF SUCH
HAPPINESS, INSTANTLY.  TWO MINUTES AFTER HER ENTERING THE ROOM, CAPTAIN
WENTWORTH SAID--

"WE WILL WRITE THE LETTER WE WERE TALKING OF, HARVILLE, NOW, IF YOU
WILL GIVE ME MATERIALS."

MATERIALS WERE AT HAND, ON A SEPARATE TABLE; HE WENT TO IT, AND NEARLY
TURNING HIS BACK TO THEM ALL, WAS ENGROSSED BY WRITING.

MRS MUSGROVE WAS GIVING MRS CROFT THE HISTORY OF HER ELDEST DAUGHTER'S
ENGAGEMENT, AND JUST IN THAT INCONVENIENT TONE OF VOICE WHICH WAS
PERFECTLY AUDIBLE WHILE IT PRETENDED TO BE A WHISPER.  ANNE FELT THAT
SHE DID NOT BELONG TO THE CONVERSATION, AND YET, AS CAPTAIN HARVILLE
SEEMED THOUGHTFUL AND NOT DISPOSED TO TALK, SHE COULD NOT AVOID HEARING
MANY UNDESIRABLE PARTICULARS; SUCH AS, "HOW MR MUSGROVE AND MY BROTHER
HAYTER HAD MET AGAIN AND AGAIN TO TALK IT OVER; WHAT MY BROTHER HAYTER
HAD SAID ONE DAY, AND WHAT MR MUSGROVE HAD PROPOSED THE NEXT, AND WHAT
HAD OCCURRED TO MY SISTER HAYTER, AND WHAT THE YOUNG PEOPLE HAD WISHED,
AND WHAT I SAID AT FIRST I NEVER COULD CONSENT TO, BUT WAS AFTERWARDS
PERSUADED TO THINK MIGHT DO VERY WELL," AND A GREAT DEAL IN THE SAME
STYLE OF OPEN-HEARTED COMMUNICATION:  MINUTIAE WHICH, EVEN WITH EVERY
ADVANTAGE OF TASTE AND DELICACY, WHICH GOOD MRS MUSGROVE COULD NOT
GIVE, COULD BE PROPERLY INTERESTING ONLY TO THE PRINCIPALS.  MRS CROFT
WAS ATTENDING WITH GREAT GOOD-HUMOUR, AND WHENEVER SHE SPOKE AT ALL, IT
WAS VERY SENSIBLY.  ANNE HOPED THE GENTLEMEN MIGHT EACH BE TOO MUCH
SELF-OCCUPIED TO HEAR.

"AND SO, MA'AM, ALL THESE THING CONSIDERED," SAID MRS MUSGROVE, IN HER
POWERFUL WHISPER, "THOUGH WE COULD HAVE WISHED IT DIFFERENT, YET,
ALTOGETHER, WE DID NOT THINK IT FAIR TO STAND OUT ANY LONGER, FOR
CHARLES HAYTER WAS QUITE WILD ABOUT IT, AND HENRIETTA WAS PRETTY NEAR
AS BAD; AND SO WE THOUGHT THEY HAD BETTER MARRY AT ONCE, AND MAKE THE
BEST OF IT, AS MANY OTHERS HAVE DONE BEFORE THEM.  AT ANY RATE, SAID I,
IT WILL BE BETTER THAN A LONG ENGAGEMENT."

"THAT IS PRECISELY WHAT I WAS GOING TO OBSERVE," CRIED MRS CROFT.  "I
WOULD RATHER HAVE YOUNG PEOPLE SETTLE ON A SMALL INCOME AT ONCE, AND
HAVE TO STRUGGLE WITH A FEW DIFFICULTIES TOGETHER, THAN BE INVOLVED IN
A LONG ENGAGEMENT.  I ALWAYS THINK THAT NO MUTUAL--"

"OH! DEAR MRS CROFT," CRIED MRS MUSGROVE, UNABLE TO LET HER FINISH HER
SPEECH, "THERE IS NOTHING I SO ABOMINATE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE AS A LONG
ENGAGEMENT.  IT IS WHAT I ALWAYS PROTESTED AGAINST FOR MY CHILDREN.  IT
IS ALL VERY WELL, I USED TO SAY, FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO BE ENGAGED, IF
THERE IS A CERTAINTY OF THEIR BEING ABLE TO MARRY IN SIX MONTHS, OR
EVEN IN TWELVE; BUT A LONG ENGAGEMENT--"

"YES, DEAR MA'AM," SAID MRS CROFT, "OR AN UNCERTAIN ENGAGEMENT, AN
ENGAGEMENT WHICH MAY BE LONG.  TO BEGIN WITHOUT KNOWING THAT AT SUCH A
TIME THERE WILL BE THE MEANS OF MARRYING, I HOLD TO BE VERY UNSAFE AND
UNWISE, AND WHAT I THINK ALL PARENTS SHOULD PREVENT AS FAR AS THEY CAN."

ANNE FOUND AN UNEXPECTED INTEREST HERE.  SHE FELT ITS APPLICATION TO
HERSELF, FELT IT IN A NERVOUS THRILL ALL OVER HER; AND AT THE SAME
MOMENT THAT HER EYES INSTINCTIVELY GLANCED TOWARDS THE DISTANT TABLE,
CAPTAIN WENTWORTH'S PEN CEASED TO MOVE, HIS HEAD WAS RAISED, PAUSING,
LISTENING, AND HE TURNED ROUND THE NEXT INSTANT TO GIVE A LOOK, ONE
QUICK, CONSCIOUS LOOK AT HER.

THE TWO LADIES CONTINUED TO TALK, TO RE-URGE THE SAME ADMITTED TRUTHS,
AND ENFORCE THEM WITH SUCH EXAMPLES OF THE ILL EFFECT OF A CONTRARY
PRACTICE AS HAD FALLEN WITHIN THEIR OBSERVATION, BUT ANNE HEARD NOTHING
DISTINCTLY; IT WAS ONLY A BUZZ OF WORDS IN HER EAR, HER MIND WAS IN
CONFUSION.

CAPTAIN HARVILLE, WHO HAD IN TRUTH BEEN HEARING NONE OF IT, NOW LEFT
HIS SEAT, AND MOVED TO A WINDOW, AND ANNE SEEMING TO WATCH HIM, THOUGH
IT WAS FROM THOROUGH ABSENCE OF MIND, BECAME GRADUALLY SENSIBLE THAT HE
WAS INVITING HER TO JOIN HIM WHERE HE STOOD.  HE LOOKED AT HER WITH A
SMILE, AND A LITTLE MOTION OF THE HEAD, WHICH EXPRESSED, "COME TO ME, I
HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY;" AND THE UNAFFECTED, EASY KINDNESS OF MANNER
WHICH DENOTED THE FEELINGS OF AN OLDER ACQUAINTANCE THAN HE REALLY WAS,
STRONGLY ENFORCED THE INVITATION.  SHE ROUSED HERSELF AND WENT TO HIM.
THE WINDOW AT WHICH HE STOOD WAS AT THE OTHER END OF THE ROOM FROM
WHERE THE TWO LADIES WERE SITTING, AND THOUGH NEARER TO CAPTAIN
WENTWORTH'S TABLE, NOT VERY NEAR.  AS SHE JOINED HIM, CAPTAIN
HARVILLE'S COUNTENANCE RE-ASSUMED THE SERIOUS, THOUGHTFUL EXPRESSION
WHICH SEEMED ITS NATURAL CHARACTER.

"LOOK HERE," SAID HE, UNFOLDING A PARCEL IN HIS HAND, AND DISPLAYING A
SMALL MINIATURE PAINTING, "DO YOU KNOW WHO THAT IS?"

"CERTAINLY:  CAPTAIN BENWICK."

"YES, AND YOU MAY GUESS WHO IT IS FOR.  BUT," (IN A DEEP TONE,) "IT WAS
NOT DONE FOR HER.  MISS ELLIOT, DO YOU REMEMBER OUR WALKING TOGETHER AT
LYME, AND GRIEVING FOR HIM?  I LITTLE THOUGHT THEN--BUT NO MATTER.
THIS WAS DRAWN AT THE CAPE.  HE MET WITH A CLEVER YOUNG GERMAN ARTIST
AT THE CAPE, AND IN COMPLIANCE WITH A PROMISE TO MY POOR SISTER, SAT TO
HIM, AND WAS BRINGING IT HOME FOR HER; AND I HAVE NOW THE CHARGE OF
GETTING IT PROPERLY SET FOR ANOTHER!  IT WAS A COMMISSION TO ME!  BUT
WHO ELSE WAS THERE TO EMPLOY?  I HOPE I CAN ALLOW FOR HIM.  I AM NOT
SORRY, INDEED, TO MAKE IT OVER TO ANOTHER.  HE UNDERTAKES IT;" (LOOKING
TOWARDS CAPTAIN WENTWORTH,) "HE IS WRITING ABOUT IT NOW."  AND WITH A
QUIVERING LIP HE WOUND UP THE WHOLE BY ADDING, "POOR FANNY! SHE WOULD
NOT HAVE FORGOTTEN HIM SO SOON!"

"NO," REPLIED ANNE, IN A LOW, FEELING VOICE. "THAT I CAN EASILY
BELIEVE."

"IT WAS NOT IN HER NATURE.  SHE DOTED ON HIM."

"IT WOULD NOT BE THE NATURE OF ANY WOMAN WHO TRULY LOVED."

CAPTAIN HARVILLE SMILED, AS MUCH AS TO SAY, "DO YOU CLAIM THAT FOR YOUR
SEX?" AND SHE ANSWERED THE QUESTION, SMILING ALSO, "YES.  WE CERTAINLY
DO NOT FORGET YOU AS SOON AS YOU FORGET US.  IT IS, PERHAPS, OUR FATE
RATHER THAN OUR MERIT.  WE CANNOT HELP OURSELVES.  WE LIVE AT HOME,
QUIET, CONFINED, AND OUR FEELINGS PREY UPON US.  YOU ARE FORCED ON
EXERTION.  YOU HAVE ALWAYS A PROFESSION, PURSUITS, BUSINESS OF SOME
SORT OR OTHER, TO TAKE YOU BACK INTO THE WORLD IMMEDIATELY, AND
CONTINUAL OCCUPATION AND CHANGE SOON WEAKEN IMPRESSIONS."

"GRANTING YOUR ASSERTION THAT THE WORLD DOES ALL THIS SO SOON FOR MEN
(WHICH, HOWEVER, I DO NOT THINK I SHALL GRANT), IT DOES NOT APPLY TO
BENWICK.  HE HAS NOT BEEN FORCED UPON ANY EXERTION.  THE PEACE TURNED
HIM ON SHORE AT THE VERY MOMENT, AND HE HAS BEEN LIVING WITH US, IN OUR
LITTLE FAMILY CIRCLE, EVER SINCE."

"TRUE," SAID ANNE, "VERY TRUE; I DID NOT RECOLLECT; BUT WHAT SHALL WE
SAY NOW, CAPTAIN HARVILLE?  IF THE CHANGE BE NOT FROM OUTWARD
CIRCUMSTANCES, IT MUST BE FROM WITHIN; IT MUST BE NATURE, MAN'S NATURE,
WHICH HAS DONE THE BUSINESS FOR CAPTAIN BENWICK."

"NO, NO, IT IS NOT MAN'S NATURE.  I WILL NOT ALLOW IT TO BE MORE MAN'S
NATURE THAN WOMAN'S TO BE INCONSTANT AND FORGET THOSE THEY DO LOVE, OR
HAVE LOVED.  I BELIEVE THE REVERSE.  I BELIEVE IN A TRUE ANALOGY
BETWEEN OUR BODILY FRAMES AND OUR MENTAL; AND THAT AS OUR BODIES ARE
THE STRONGEST, SO ARE OUR FEELINGS; CAPABLE OF BEARING MOST ROUGH
USAGE, AND RIDING OUT THE HEAVIEST WEATHER."

"YOUR FEELINGS MAY BE THE STRONGEST," REPLIED ANNE, "BUT THE SAME
SPIRIT OF ANALOGY WILL AUTHORISE ME TO ASSERT THAT OURS ARE THE MOST
TENDER.  MAN IS MORE ROBUST THAN WOMAN, BUT HE IS NOT LONGER LIVED;
WHICH EXACTLY EXPLAINS MY VIEW OF THE NATURE OF THEIR ATTACHMENTS.
NAY, IT WOULD BE TOO HARD UPON YOU, IF IT WERE OTHERWISE.  YOU HAVE
DIFFICULTIES, AND PRIVATIONS, AND DANGERS ENOUGH TO STRUGGLE WITH.  YOU
ARE ALWAYS LABOURING AND TOILING, EXPOSED TO EVERY RISK AND HARDSHIP.
YOUR HOME, COUNTRY, FRIENDS, ALL QUITTED.  NEITHER TIME, NOR HEALTH,
NOR LIFE, TO BE CALLED YOUR OWN.  IT WOULD BE HARD, INDEED" (WITH A
FALTERING VOICE), "IF WOMAN'S FEELINGS WERE TO BE ADDED TO ALL THIS."

"WE SHALL NEVER AGREE UPON THIS QUESTION," CAPTAIN HARVILLE WAS
BEGINNING TO SAY, WHEN A SLIGHT NOISE CALLED THEIR ATTENTION TO CAPTAIN
WENTWORTH'S HITHERTO PERFECTLY QUIET DIVISION OF THE ROOM.  IT WAS
NOTHING MORE THAN THAT HIS PEN HAD FALLEN DOWN; BUT ANNE WAS STARTLED
AT FINDING HIM NEARER THAN SHE HAD SUPPOSED, AND HALF INCLINED TO
SUSPECT THAT THE PEN HAD ONLY FALLEN BECAUSE HE HAD BEEN OCCUPIED BY
THEM, STRIVING TO CATCH SOUNDS, WHICH YET SHE DID NOT THINK HE COULD
HAVE CAUGHT.

"HAVE YOU FINISHED YOUR LETTER?" SAID CAPTAIN HARVILLE.

"NOT QUITE, A FEW LINES MORE.  I SHALL HAVE DONE IN FIVE MINUTES."

"THERE IS NO HURRY ON MY SIDE.  I AM ONLY READY WHENEVER YOU ARE.  I AM
IN VERY GOOD ANCHORAGE HERE," (SMILING AT ANNE,) "WELL SUPPLIED, AND
WANT FOR NOTHING.  NO HURRY FOR A SIGNAL AT ALL.  WELL, MISS ELLIOT,"
(LOWERING HIS VOICE,) "AS I WAS SAYING WE SHALL NEVER AGREE, I SUPPOSE,
UPON THIS POINT.  NO MAN AND WOMAN, WOULD, PROBABLY.  BUT LET ME
OBSERVE THAT ALL HISTORIES ARE AGAINST YOU--ALL STORIES, PROSE AND
VERSE.  IF I HAD SUCH A MEMORY AS BENWICK, I COULD BRING YOU FIFTY
QUOTATIONS IN A MOMENT ON MY SIDE THE ARGUMENT, AND I DO NOT THINK I
EVER OPENED A BOOK IN MY LIFE WHICH HAD NOT SOMETHING TO SAY UPON
WOMAN'S INCONSTANCY.  SONGS AND PROVERBS, ALL TALK OF WOMAN'S
FICKLENESS.  BUT PERHAPS YOU WILL SAY, THESE WERE ALL WRITTEN BY MEN."

"PERHAPS I SHALL.  YES, YES, IF YOU PLEASE, NO REFERENCE TO EXAMPLES IN
BOOKS.  MEN HAVE HAD EVERY ADVANTAGE OF US IN TELLING THEIR OWN STORY.
EDUCATION HAS BEEN THEIRS IN SO MUCH HIGHER A DEGREE; THE PEN HAS BEEN
IN THEIR HANDS.  I WILL NOT ALLOW BOOKS TO PROVE ANYTHING."

"BUT HOW SHALL WE PROVE ANYTHING?"

"WE NEVER SHALL.  WE NEVER CAN EXPECT TO PROVE ANY THING UPON SUCH A
POINT.  IT IS A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION WHICH DOES NOT ADMIT OF PROOF.
WE EACH BEGIN, PROBABLY, WITH A LITTLE BIAS TOWARDS OUR OWN SEX; AND
UPON THAT BIAS BUILD EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE IN FAVOUR OF IT WHICH HAS
OCCURRED WITHIN OUR OWN CIRCLE; MANY OF WHICH CIRCUMSTANCES (PERHAPS
THOSE VERY CASES WHICH STRIKE US THE MOST) MAY BE PRECISELY SUCH AS
CANNOT BE BROUGHT FORWARD WITHOUT BETRAYING A CONFIDENCE, OR IN SOME
RESPECT SAYING WHAT SHOULD NOT BE SAID."

"AH!" CRIED CAPTAIN HARVILLE, IN A TONE OF STRONG FEELING, "IF I COULD
BUT MAKE YOU COMPREHEND WHAT A MAN SUFFERS WHEN HE TAKES A LAST LOOK AT
HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN, AND WATCHES THE BOAT THAT HE HAS SENT THEM OFF
IN, AS LONG AS IT IS IN SIGHT, AND THEN TURNS AWAY AND SAYS, 'GOD KNOWS
WHETHER WE EVER MEET AGAIN!' AND THEN, IF I COULD CONVEY TO YOU THE
GLOW OF HIS SOUL WHEN HE DOES SEE THEM AGAIN; WHEN, COMING BACK AFTER A
TWELVEMONTH'S ABSENCE, PERHAPS, AND OBLIGED TO PUT INTO ANOTHER PORT,
HE CALCULATES HOW SOON IT BE POSSIBLE TO GET THEM THERE, PRETENDING TO
DECEIVE HIMSELF, AND SAYING, 'THEY CANNOT BE HERE TILL SUCH A DAY,' BUT
ALL THE WHILE HOPING FOR THEM TWELVE HOURS SOONER, AND SEEING THEM
ARRIVE AT LAST, AS IF HEAVEN HAD GIVEN THEM WINGS, BY MANY HOURS SOONER
STILL!  IF I COULD EXPLAIN TO YOU ALL THIS, AND ALL THAT A MAN CAN BEAR
AND DO, AND GLORIES TO DO, FOR THE SAKE OF THESE TREASURES OF HIS
EXISTENCE!  I SPEAK, YOU KNOW, ONLY OF SUCH MEN AS HAVE HEARTS!"
PRESSING HIS OWN WITH EMOTION.

"OH!" CRIED ANNE EAGERLY, "I HOPE I DO JUSTICE TO ALL THAT IS FELT BY
YOU, AND BY THOSE WHO RESEMBLE YOU.  GOD FORBID THAT I SHOULD
UNDERVALUE THE WARM AND FAITHFUL FEELINGS OF ANY OF MY
FELLOW-CREATURES!  I SHOULD DESERVE UTTER CONTEMPT IF I DARED TO
SUPPOSE THAT TRUE ATTACHMENT AND CONSTANCY WERE KNOWN ONLY BY WOMAN.
NO, I BELIEVE YOU CAPABLE OF EVERYTHING GREAT AND GOOD IN YOUR MARRIED
LIVES.  I BELIEVE YOU EQUAL TO EVERY IMPORTANT EXERTION, AND TO EVERY
DOMESTIC FORBEARANCE, SO LONG AS--IF I MAY BE ALLOWED THE
EXPRESSION--SO LONG AS YOU HAVE AN OBJECT.  I MEAN WHILE THE WOMAN YOU
LOVE LIVES, AND LIVES FOR YOU.  ALL THE PRIVILEGE I CLAIM FOR MY OWN
SEX (IT IS NOT A VERY ENVIABLE ONE; YOU NEED NOT COVET IT), IS THAT OF
LOVING LONGEST, WHEN EXISTENCE OR WHEN HOPE IS GONE."

SHE COULD NOT IMMEDIATELY HAVE UTTERED ANOTHER SENTENCE; HER HEART WAS
TOO FULL, HER BREATH TOO MUCH OPPRESSED.

"YOU ARE A GOOD SOUL," CRIED CAPTAIN HARVILLE, PUTTING HIS HAND ON HER
ARM, QUITE AFFECTIONATELY.  "THERE IS NO QUARRELLING WITH YOU.  AND
WHEN I THINK OF BENWICK, MY TONGUE IS TIED."

THEIR ATTENTION WAS CALLED TOWARDS THE OTHERS.  MRS CROFT WAS TAKING
LEAVE.

"HERE, FREDERICK, YOU AND I PART COMPANY, I BELIEVE," SAID SHE.  "I AM
GOING HOME, AND YOU HAVE AN ENGAGEMENT WITH YOUR FRIEND.  TO-NIGHT WE
MAY HAVE THE PLEASURE OF ALL MEETING AGAIN AT YOUR PARTY," (TURNING TO
ANNE.)  "WE HAD YOUR SISTER'S CARD YESTERDAY, AND I UNDERSTOOD
FREDERICK HAD A CARD TOO, THOUGH I DID NOT SEE IT; AND YOU ARE
DISENGAGED, FREDERICK, ARE YOU NOT, AS WELL AS OURSELVES?"

CAPTAIN WENTWORTH WAS FOLDING UP A LETTER IN GREAT HASTE, AND EITHER
COULD NOT OR WOULD NOT ANSWER FULLY.

"YES," SAID HE, "VERY TRUE; HERE WE SEPARATE, BUT HARVILLE AND I SHALL
SOON BE AFTER YOU; THAT IS, HARVILLE, IF YOU ARE READY, I AM IN HALF A
MINUTE.  I KNOW YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY TO BE OFF.  I SHALL BE AT YOUR
SERVICE IN HALF A MINUTE."

MRS CROFT LEFT THEM, AND CAPTAIN WENTWORTH, HAVING SEALED HIS LETTER
WITH GREAT RAPIDITY, WAS INDEED READY, AND HAD EVEN A HURRIED, AGITATED
AIR, WHICH SHEWED IMPATIENCE TO BE GONE.  ANNE KNEW NOT HOW TO
UNDERSTAND IT.  SHE HAD THE KINDEST "GOOD MORNING, GOD BLESS YOU!" FROM
CAPTAIN HARVILLE, BUT FROM HIM NOT A WORD, NOR A LOOK!  HE HAD PASSED
OUT OF THE ROOM WITHOUT A LOOK!

SHE HAD ONLY TIME, HOWEVER, TO MOVE CLOSER TO THE TABLE WHERE HE HAD
BEEN WRITING, WHEN FOOTSTEPS WERE HEARD RETURNING; THE DOOR OPENED, IT
WAS HIMSELF.  HE BEGGED THEIR PARDON, BUT HE HAD FORGOTTEN HIS GLOVES,
AND INSTANTLY CROSSING THE ROOM TO THE WRITING TABLE, HE DREW OUT A
LETTER FROM UNDER THE SCATTERED PAPER, PLACED IT BEFORE ANNE WITH EYES
OF GLOWING ENTREATY FIXED ON HER FOR A TIME, AND HASTILY COLLECTING HIS
GLOVES, WAS AGAIN OUT OF THE ROOM, ALMOST BEFORE MRS MUSGROVE WAS AWARE
OF HIS BEING IN IT: THE WORK OF AN INSTANT!

THE REVOLUTION WHICH ONE INSTANT HAD MADE IN ANNE, WAS ALMOST BEYOND
EXPRESSION.  THE LETTER, WITH A DIRECTION HARDLY LEGIBLE, TO "MISS A.
E.--," WAS EVIDENTLY THE ONE WHICH HE HAD BEEN FOLDING SO HASTILY.
WHILE SUPPOSED TO BE WRITING ONLY TO CAPTAIN BENWICK, HE HAD BEEN ALSO
ADDRESSING HER!  ON THE CONTENTS OF THAT LETTER DEPENDED ALL WHICH THIS
WORLD COULD DO FOR HER.  ANYTHING WAS POSSIBLE, ANYTHING MIGHT BE
DEFIED RATHER THAN SUSPENSE.  MRS MUSGROVE HAD LITTLE ARRANGEMENTS OF
HER OWN AT HER OWN TABLE; TO THEIR PROTECTION SHE MUST TRUST, AND
SINKING INTO THE CHAIR WHICH HE HAD OCCUPIED, SUCCEEDING TO THE VERY
SPOT WHERE HE HAD LEANED AND WRITTEN, HER EYES DEVOURED THE FOLLOWING
WORDS:


"I CAN LISTEN NO LONGER IN SILENCE.  I MUST SPEAK TO YOU BY SUCH MEANS
AS ARE WITHIN MY REACH.  YOU PIERCE MY SOUL.  I AM HALF AGONY, HALF
HOPE.  TELL ME NOT THAT I AM TOO LATE, THAT SUCH PRECIOUS FEELINGS ARE
GONE FOR EVER.  I OFFER MYSELF TO YOU AGAIN WITH A HEART EVEN MORE YOUR
OWN THAN WHEN YOU ALMOST BROKE IT, EIGHT YEARS AND A HALF AGO.  DARE
NOT SAY THAT MAN FORGETS SOONER THAN  WOMAN, THAT HIS LOVE HAS AN
EARLIER DEATH.  I HAVE LOVED NONE BUT YOU.  UNJUST I MAY HAVE BEEN,
WEAK AND RESENTFUL I HAVE BEEN, BUT NEVER INCONSTANT.  YOU ALONE HAVE
BROUGHT ME TO BATH.  FOR YOU ALONE, I THINK AND PLAN.  HAVE YOU NOT
SEEN THIS?  CAN YOU FAIL TO HAVE UNDERSTOOD MY WISHES?  I HAD NOT
WAITED EVEN THESE TEN DAYS, COULD I HAVE READ YOUR FEELINGS, AS I THINK
YOU MUST HAVE PENETRATED MINE.  I CAN HARDLY WRITE.  I AM EVERY INSTANT
HEARING SOMETHING WHICH OVERPOWERS ME.  YOU SINK YOUR VOICE, BUT I CAN
DISTINGUISH THE TONES OF THAT VOICE WHEN THEY WOULD BE LOST ON OTHERS.
TOO GOOD, TOO EXCELLENT CREATURE!  YOU DO US JUSTICE, INDEED.  YOU DO
BELIEVE THAT THERE IS TRUE ATTACHMENT AND CONSTANCY AMONG MEN.  BELIEVE
IT TO BE MOST FERVENT, MOST UNDEVIATING, IN F. W.

"I MUST GO, UNCERTAIN OF MY FATE; BUT I SHALL RETURN HITHER, OR FOLLOW
YOUR PARTY, AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  A WORD, A LOOK, WILL BE ENOUGH TO
DECIDE WHETHER I ENTER YOUR FATHER'S HOUSE THIS EVENING OR NEVER."


SUCH A LETTER WAS NOT TO BE SOON RECOVERED FROM.  HALF AN HOUR'S
SOLITUDE AND REFLECTION MIGHT HAVE TRANQUILLIZED HER; BUT THE TEN
MINUTES ONLY WHICH NOW PASSED BEFORE SHE WAS INTERRUPTED, WITH ALL THE
RESTRAINTS OF HER SITUATION, COULD DO NOTHING TOWARDS TRANQUILLITY.
EVERY MOMENT RATHER BROUGHT FRESH AGITATION.  IT WAS OVERPOWERING
HAPPINESS.  AND BEFORE SHE WAS BEYOND THE FIRST STAGE OF FULL
SENSATION, CHARLES, MARY, AND HENRIETTA ALL CAME IN.

THE ABSOLUTE NECESSITY OF SEEMING LIKE HERSELF PRODUCED THEN AN
IMMEDIATE STRUGGLE; BUT AFTER A WHILE SHE COULD DO NO MORE.  SHE BEGAN
NOT TO UNDERSTAND A WORD THEY SAID, AND WAS OBLIGED TO PLEAD
INDISPOSITION AND EXCUSE HERSELF.  THEY COULD THEN SEE THAT SHE LOOKED
VERY ILL, WERE SHOCKED AND CONCERNED, AND WOULD NOT STIR WITHOUT HER
FOR THE WORLD.  THIS WAS DREADFUL.  WOULD THEY ONLY HAVE GONE AWAY, AND
LEFT HER IN THE QUIET POSSESSION OF THAT ROOM IT WOULD HAVE BEEN HER
CURE; BUT TO HAVE THEM ALL STANDING OR WAITING AROUND HER WAS
DISTRACTING, AND IN DESPERATION, SHE SAID SHE WOULD GO HOME.

"BY ALL MEANS, MY DEAR," CRIED MRS MUSGROVE, "GO HOME DIRECTLY, AND
TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF, THAT YOU MAY BE FIT FOR THE EVENING.  I WISH
SARAH WAS HERE TO DOCTOR YOU, BUT I AM NO DOCTOR MYSELF.  CHARLES, RING
AND ORDER A CHAIR.  SHE MUST NOT WALK."

BUT THE CHAIR WOULD NEVER DO.  WORSE THAN ALL!  TO LOSE THE POSSIBILITY
OF SPEAKING TWO WORDS TO CAPTAIN WENTWORTH IN THE COURSE OF HER QUIET,
SOLITARY PROGRESS UP THE TOWN (AND SHE FELT ALMOST CERTAIN OF MEETING
HIM) COULD NOT BE BORNE.  THE CHAIR WAS EARNESTLY PROTESTED AGAINST,
AND MRS MUSGROVE, WHO THOUGHT ONLY OF ONE SORT OF ILLNESS, HAVING
ASSURED HERSELF WITH SOME ANXIETY, THAT THERE HAD BEEN NO FALL IN THE
CASE; THAT ANNE HAD NOT AT ANY TIME LATELY SLIPPED DOWN, AND GOT A BLOW
ON HER HEAD; THAT SHE WAS PERFECTLY CONVINCED OF HAVING HAD NO FALL;
COULD PART WITH HER CHEERFULLY, AND DEPEND ON FINDING HER BETTER AT
NIGHT.

ANXIOUS TO OMIT NO POSSIBLE PRECAUTION, ANNE STRUGGLED, AND SAID--

"I AM AFRAID, MA'AM, THAT IT IS NOT PERFECTLY UNDERSTOOD.  PRAY BE SO
GOOD AS TO MENTION TO THE OTHER GENTLEMEN THAT WE HOPE TO SEE YOUR
WHOLE PARTY THIS EVENING.  I AM AFRAID THERE HAD BEEN SOME MISTAKE; AND
I WISH YOU PARTICULARLY TO ASSURE CAPTAIN HARVILLE AND CAPTAIN
WENTWORTH, THAT WE HOPE TO SEE THEM BOTH."

"OH! MY DEAR, IT IS QUITE UNDERSTOOD, I GIVE YOU MY WORD.  CAPTAIN
HARVILLE HAS NO THOUGHT BUT OF GOING."

"DO YOU THINK SO?  BUT I AM AFRAID; AND I SHOULD BE SO VERY SORRY.
WILL YOU PROMISE ME TO MENTION IT, WHEN YOU SEE THEM AGAIN?  YOU WILL
SEE THEM BOTH THIS MORNING, I DARE SAY.  DO PROMISE ME."

"TO BE SURE I WILL, IF YOU WISH IT.  CHARLES, IF YOU SEE CAPTAIN
HARVILLE ANYWHERE, REMEMBER TO GIVE MISS ANNE'S MESSAGE.  BUT INDEED,
MY DEAR, YOU NEED NOT BE UNEASY.  CAPTAIN HARVILLE HOLDS HIMSELF QUITE
ENGAGED, I'LL ANSWER FOR IT; AND CAPTAIN WENTWORTH THE SAME, I DARE
SAY."

ANNE COULD DO NO MORE; BUT HER HEART PROPHESIED SOME MISCHANCE TO DAMP
THE PERFECTION OF HER FELICITY.  IT COULD NOT BE VERY LASTING, HOWEVER.
EVEN IF HE DID NOT COME TO CAMDEN PLACE HIMSELF, IT WOULD BE IN HER
POWER TO SEND AN INTELLIGIBLE SENTENCE BY CAPTAIN HARVILLE.  ANOTHER
MOMENTARY VEXATION OCCURRED.  CHARLES, IN HIS REAL CONCERN AND GOOD
NATURE, WOULD GO HOME WITH HER; THERE WAS NO PREVENTING HIM.  THIS WAS
ALMOST CRUEL.  BUT SHE COULD NOT BE LONG UNGRATEFUL; HE WAS SACRIFICING
AN ENGAGEMENT AT A GUNSMITH'S, TO BE OF USE TO HER; AND SHE SET OFF
WITH HIM, WITH NO FEELING BUT GRATITUDE APPARENT.

THEY WERE ON UNION STREET, WHEN A QUICKER STEP BEHIND, A SOMETHING OF
FAMILIAR SOUND, GAVE HER TWO MOMENTS' PREPARATION FOR THE SIGHT OF
CAPTAIN WENTWORTH.  HE JOINED THEM; BUT, AS IF IRRESOLUTE WHETHER TO
JOIN OR TO PASS ON, SAID NOTHING, ONLY LOOKED.  ANNE COULD COMMAND
HERSELF ENOUGH TO RECEIVE THAT LOOK, AND NOT REPULSIVELY.  THE CHEEKS
WHICH HAD BEEN PALE NOW GLOWED, AND THE MOVEMENTS WHICH HAD HESITATED
WERE DECIDED.  HE WALKED BY HER SIDE.  PRESENTLY, STRUCK BY A SUDDEN
THOUGHT, CHARLES SAID--

"CAPTAIN WENTWORTH, WHICH WAY ARE YOU GOING?  ONLY TO GAY STREET, OR
FARTHER UP THE TOWN?"

"I HARDLY KNOW," REPLIED CAPTAIN WENTWORTH, SURPRISED.

"ARE YOU GOING AS HIGH AS BELMONT?  ARE YOU GOING NEAR CAMDEN PLACE?
BECAUSE, IF YOU ARE, I SHALL HAVE NO SCRUPLE IN ASKING YOU TO TAKE MY
PLACE, AND GIVE ANNE YOUR ARM TO HER FATHER'S DOOR.  SHE IS RATHER DONE
FOR THIS MORNING, AND MUST NOT GO SO FAR WITHOUT HELP, AND I OUGHT TO
BE AT THAT FELLOW'S IN THE MARKET PLACE.  HE PROMISED ME THE SIGHT OF A
CAPITAL GUN HE IS JUST GOING TO SEND OFF; SAID HE WOULD KEEP IT
UNPACKED TO THE LAST POSSIBLE MOMENT, THAT I MIGHT SEE IT; AND IF I DO
NOT TURN BACK NOW, I HAVE NO CHANCE.  BY HIS DESCRIPTION, A GOOD DEAL
LIKE THE SECOND SIZE DOUBLE-BARREL OF MINE, WHICH YOU SHOT WITH ONE DAY
ROUND WINTHROP."

THERE COULD NOT BE AN OBJECTION.  THERE COULD BE ONLY THE MOST PROPER
ALACRITY, A MOST OBLIGING COMPLIANCE FOR PUBLIC VIEW; AND SMILES REINED
IN AND SPIRITS DANCING IN PRIVATE RAPTURE.  IN HALF A MINUTE CHARLES
WAS AT THE BOTTOM OF UNION STREET AGAIN, AND THE OTHER TWO PROCEEDING
TOGETHER:  AND SOON WORDS ENOUGH HAD PASSED BETWEEN THEM TO DECIDE
THEIR DIRECTION TOWARDS THE COMPARATIVELY QUIET AND RETIRED GRAVEL
WALK, WHERE THE POWER OF CONVERSATION WOULD MAKE THE PRESENT HOUR A
BLESSING INDEED, AND PREPARE IT FOR ALL THE IMMORTALITY WHICH THE
HAPPIEST RECOLLECTIONS OF THEIR OWN FUTURE LIVES COULD BESTOW.  THERE
THEY EXCHANGED AGAIN THOSE FEELINGS AND THOSE PROMISES WHICH HAD ONCE
BEFORE SEEMED TO SECURE EVERYTHING, BUT WHICH HAD BEEN FOLLOWED BY SO
MANY, MANY YEARS OF DIVISION AND ESTRANGEMENT.  THERE THEY RETURNED
AGAIN INTO THE PAST, MORE EXQUISITELY HAPPY, PERHAPS, IN THEIR
RE-UNION, THAN WHEN IT HAD BEEN FIRST PROJECTED; MORE TENDER, MORE
TRIED, MORE FIXED IN A KNOWLEDGE OF EACH OTHER'S CHARACTER, TRUTH, AND
ATTACHMENT; MORE EQUAL TO ACT, MORE JUSTIFIED IN ACTING.  AND THERE, AS
THEY SLOWLY PACED THE GRADUAL ASCENT, HEEDLESS OF EVERY GROUP AROUND
THEM, SEEING NEITHER SAUNTERING POLITICIANS, BUSTLING HOUSEKEEPERS,
FLIRTING GIRLS, NOR NURSERY-MAIDS AND CHILDREN, THEY COULD INDULGE IN
THOSE RETROSPECTIONS AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS, AND ESPECIALLY IN THOSE
EXPLANATIONS OF WHAT HAD DIRECTLY PRECEDED THE PRESENT MOMENT, WHICH
WERE SO POIGNANT AND SO CEASELESS IN INTEREST.  ALL THE LITTLE
VARIATIONS OF THE LAST WEEK WERE GONE THROUGH; AND OF YESTERDAY AND
TODAY THERE COULD SCARCELY BE AN END.

SHE HAD NOT MISTAKEN HIM.  JEALOUSY OF MR ELLIOT HAD BEEN THE RETARDING
WEIGHT, THE DOUBT, THE TORMENT.  THAT HAD BEGUN TO OPERATE IN THE VERY
HOUR OF FIRST MEETING HER IN BATH; THAT HAD RETURNED, AFTER A SHORT
SUSPENSION, TO RUIN THE CONCERT; AND THAT HAD INFLUENCED HIM IN
EVERYTHING HE HAD SAID AND DONE, OR OMITTED TO SAY AND DO, IN THE LAST
FOUR-AND-TWENTY HOURS.  IT HAD BEEN GRADUALLY YIELDING TO THE BETTER
HOPES WHICH HER LOOKS, OR WORDS, OR ACTIONS OCCASIONALLY ENCOURAGED; IT
HAD BEEN VANQUISHED AT LAST BY THOSE SENTIMENTS AND THOSE TONES WHICH
HAD REACHED HIM WHILE SHE TALKED WITH CAPTAIN HARVILLE; AND UNDER THE
IRRESISTIBLE GOVERNANCE OF WHICH HE HAD SEIZED A SHEET OF PAPER, AND
POURED OUT HIS FEELINGS.

OF WHAT HE HAD THEN WRITTEN, NOTHING WAS TO BE RETRACTED OR QUALIFIED.
HE PERSISTED IN HAVING LOVED NONE BUT HER.  SHE HAD NEVER BEEN
SUPPLANTED.  HE NEVER EVEN BELIEVED HIMSELF TO SEE HER EQUAL.  THUS
MUCH INDEED HE WAS OBLIGED TO ACKNOWLEDGE:  THAT HE HAD BEEN CONSTANT
UNCONSCIOUSLY, NAY UNINTENTIONALLY; THAT HE HAD MEANT TO FORGET HER,
AND BELIEVED IT TO BE DONE.  HE HAD IMAGINED HIMSELF INDIFFERENT, WHEN
HE HAD ONLY BEEN ANGRY; AND HE HAD BEEN UNJUST TO HER MERITS, BECAUSE
HE HAD BEEN A SUFFERER FROM THEM.  HER CHARACTER WAS NOW FIXED ON HIS
MIND AS PERFECTION ITSELF, MAINTAINING THE LOVELIEST MEDIUM OF
FORTITUDE AND GENTLENESS; BUT HE WAS OBLIGED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT ONLY
AT UPPERCROSS HAD HE LEARNT TO DO HER JUSTICE, AND ONLY AT LYME HAD HE
BEGUN TO UNDERSTAND HIMSELF.  AT LYME, HE HAD RECEIVED LESSONS OF MORE
THAN ONE SORT.  THE PASSING ADMIRATION OF MR ELLIOT HAD AT LEAST ROUSED
HIM, AND THE SCENES ON THE COBB AND AT CAPTAIN HARVILLE'S HAD FIXED HER
SUPERIORITY.

IN HIS PRECEDING ATTEMPTS TO ATTACH HIMSELF TO LOUISA MUSGROVE (THE
ATTEMPTS OF ANGRY PRIDE), HE PROTESTED THAT HE HAD FOR EVER FELT IT TO
BE IMPOSSIBLE; THAT HE HAD NOT CARED, COULD NOT CARE, FOR LOUISA;
THOUGH TILL THAT DAY, TILL THE LEISURE FOR REFLECTION WHICH FOLLOWED
IT, HE HAD NOT UNDERSTOOD THE PERFECT EXCELLENCE OF THE MIND WITH WHICH
LOUISA'S COULD SO ILL BEAR A COMPARISON, OR THE PERFECT UNRIVALLED HOLD
IT POSSESSED OVER HIS OWN.  THERE, HE HAD LEARNT TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN
THE STEADINESS OF PRINCIPLE AND THE OBSTINACY OF SELF-WILL, BETWEEN THE
DARINGS OF HEEDLESSNESS AND THE RESOLUTION OF A COLLECTED MIND.  THERE
HE HAD SEEN EVERYTHING TO EXALT IN HIS ESTIMATION THE WOMAN HE HAD
LOST; AND THERE BEGUN TO DEPLORE THE PRIDE, THE FOLLY, THE MADNESS OF
RESENTMENT, WHICH HAD KEPT HIM FROM TRYING TO REGAIN HER WHEN THROWN IN
HIS WAY.

FROM THAT PERIOD HIS PENANCE HAD BECOME SEVERE.  HE HAD NO SOONER BEEN
FREE FROM THE HORROR AND REMORSE ATTENDING THE FIRST FEW DAYS OF
LOUISA'S ACCIDENT, NO SOONER BEGUN TO FEEL HIMSELF ALIVE AGAIN, THAN HE
HAD BEGUN TO FEEL HIMSELF, THOUGH ALIVE, NOT AT LIBERTY.

"I FOUND," SAID HE, "THAT I WAS CONSIDERED BY HARVILLE AN ENGAGED MAN!
THAT NEITHER HARVILLE NOR HIS WIFE ENTERTAINED A DOUBT OF OUR MUTUAL
ATTACHMENT.  I WAS STARTLED AND SHOCKED.  TO A DEGREE, I COULD
CONTRADICT THIS INSTANTLY; BUT, WHEN I BEGAN TO REFLECT THAT OTHERS
MIGHT HAVE FELT THE SAME--HER OWN FAMILY, NAY, PERHAPS HERSELF--I WAS
NO LONGER AT MY OWN DISPOSAL.  I WAS HERS IN HONOUR IF SHE WISHED IT.
I HAD BEEN UNGUARDED.  I HAD NOT THOUGHT SERIOUSLY ON THIS SUBJECT
BEFORE.  I HAD NOT CONSIDERED THAT MY EXCESSIVE INTIMACY MUST HAVE ITS
DANGER OF ILL CONSEQUENCE IN MANY WAYS; AND THAT I HAD NO RIGHT TO BE
TRYING WHETHER I COULD ATTACH MYSELF TO EITHER OF THE GIRLS, AT THE
RISK OF RAISING EVEN AN UNPLEASANT REPORT, WERE THERE NO OTHER ILL
EFFECTS.  I HAD BEEN GROSSLY WRONG, AND MUST ABIDE THE CONSEQUENCES."

HE FOUND TOO LATE, IN SHORT, THAT HE HAD ENTANGLED HIMSELF; AND THAT
PRECISELY AS HE BECAME FULLY SATISFIED OF HIS NOT CARING FOR LOUISA AT
ALL, HE MUST REGARD HIMSELF AS BOUND TO HER, IF HER SENTIMENTS FOR HIM
WERE WHAT THE HARVILLES SUPPOSED.  IT DETERMINED HIM TO LEAVE LYME, AND
AWAIT HER COMPLETE RECOVERY ELSEWHERE.  HE WOULD GLADLY WEAKEN, BY ANY
FAIR MEANS, WHATEVER FEELINGS OR SPECULATIONS CONCERNING HIM MIGHT
EXIST; AND HE WENT, THEREFORE, TO HIS BROTHER'S, MEANING AFTER A WHILE
TO RETURN TO KELLYNCH, AND ACT AS CIRCUMSTANCES MIGHT REQUIRE.

"I WAS SIX WEEKS WITH EDWARD," SAID HE, "AND SAW HIM HAPPY.  I COULD
HAVE NO OTHER PLEASURE.  I DESERVED NONE.  HE ENQUIRED AFTER YOU VERY
PARTICULARLY; ASKED EVEN IF YOU WERE PERSONALLY ALTERED, LITTLE
SUSPECTING THAT TO MY EYE YOU COULD NEVER ALTER."

ANNE SMILED, AND LET IT PASS.  IT WAS TOO PLEASING A BLUNDER FOR A
REPROACH.  IT IS SOMETHING FOR A WOMAN TO BE ASSURED, IN HER
EIGHT-AND-TWENTIETH YEAR, THAT SHE HAS NOT LOST ONE CHARM OF EARLIER
YOUTH; BUT THE VALUE OF SUCH HOMAGE WAS INEXPRESSIBLY INCREASED TO
ANNE, BY COMPARING IT WITH FORMER WORDS, AND FEELING IT TO BE THE
RESULT, NOT THE CAUSE OF A REVIVAL OF HIS WARM ATTACHMENT.

HE HAD REMAINED IN SHROPSHIRE, LAMENTING THE BLINDNESS OF HIS OWN
PRIDE, AND THE BLUNDERS OF HIS OWN CALCULATIONS, TILL AT ONCE RELEASED
FROM LOUISA BY THE ASTONISHING AND FELICITOUS INTELLIGENCE OF HER
ENGAGEMENT WITH BENWICK.

"HERE," SAID HE, "ENDED THE WORST OF MY STATE; FOR NOW I COULD AT LEAST
PUT MYSELF IN THE WAY OF HAPPINESS; I COULD EXERT MYSELF; I COULD DO
SOMETHING.  BUT TO BE WAITING SO LONG IN INACTION, AND WAITING ONLY FOR
EVIL, HAD BEEN DREADFUL.  WITHIN THE FIRST FIVE MINUTES I SAID, 'I WILL
BE AT BATH ON WEDNESDAY,' AND I WAS.  WAS IT UNPARDONABLE TO THINK IT
WORTH MY WHILE TO COME? AND TO ARRIVE WITH SOME DEGREE OF HOPE?  YOU
WERE SINGLE.  IT WAS POSSIBLE THAT YOU MIGHT RETAIN THE FEELINGS OF THE
PAST, AS I DID; AND ONE ENCOURAGEMENT HAPPENED TO BE MINE.  I COULD
NEVER DOUBT THAT YOU WOULD BE LOVED AND SOUGHT BY OTHERS, BUT I KNEW TO
A CERTAINTY THAT YOU HAD REFUSED ONE MAN, AT LEAST, OF BETTER
PRETENSIONS THAN MYSELF; AND I COULD NOT HELP OFTEN SAYING, 'WAS THIS
FOR ME?'"

THEIR FIRST MEETING IN MILSOM STREET AFFORDED MUCH TO BE SAID, BUT THE
CONCERT STILL MORE.  THAT EVENING SEEMED TO BE MADE UP OF EXQUISITE
MOMENTS.  THE MOMENT OF HER STEPPING FORWARD IN THE OCTAGON ROOM TO
SPEAK TO HIM:  THE MOMENT OF MR ELLIOT'S APPEARING AND TEARING HER
AWAY, AND ONE OR TWO SUBSEQUENT MOMENTS, MARKED BY RETURNING HOPE OR
INCREASING DESPONDENCY, WERE DWELT ON WITH ENERGY.

"TO SEE YOU," CRIED HE, "IN THE MIDST OF THOSE WHO COULD NOT BE MY
WELL-WISHERS; TO SEE YOUR COUSIN CLOSE BY YOU, CONVERSING AND SMILING,
AND FEEL ALL THE HORRIBLE ELIGIBILITIES AND PROPRIETIES OF THE MATCH!
TO CONSIDER IT AS THE CERTAIN WISH OF EVERY BEING WHO COULD HOPE TO
INFLUENCE YOU!  EVEN IF YOUR OWN FEELINGS WERE RELUCTANT OR
INDIFFERENT, TO CONSIDER WHAT POWERFUL SUPPORTS WOULD BE HIS!  WAS IT
NOT ENOUGH TO MAKE THE FOOL OF ME WHICH I APPEARED?  HOW COULD I LOOK
ON WITHOUT AGONY?  WAS NOT THE VERY SIGHT OF THE FRIEND WHO SAT BEHIND
YOU, WAS NOT THE RECOLLECTION OF WHAT HAD BEEN, THE KNOWLEDGE OF HER
INFLUENCE, THE INDELIBLE, IMMOVEABLE IMPRESSION OF WHAT PERSUASION HAD
ONCE DONE--WAS IT NOT ALL AGAINST ME?"

"YOU SHOULD HAVE DISTINGUISHED," REPLIED ANNE.  "YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE
SUSPECTED ME NOW; THE CASE IS SO DIFFERENT, AND MY AGE IS SO DIFFERENT.
IF I WAS WRONG IN YIELDING TO PERSUASION ONCE, REMEMBER THAT IT WAS TO
PERSUASION EXERTED ON THE SIDE OF SAFETY, NOT OF RISK.  WHEN I YIELDED,
I THOUGHT IT WAS TO DUTY, BUT NO DUTY COULD BE CALLED IN AID HERE.  IN
MARRYING A MAN INDIFFERENT TO ME, ALL RISK WOULD HAVE BEEN INCURRED,
AND ALL DUTY VIOLATED."

"PERHAPS I OUGHT TO HAVE REASONED THUS," HE REPLIED, "BUT I COULD NOT.
I COULD NOT DERIVE BENEFIT FROM THE LATE KNOWLEDGE I HAD ACQUIRED OF
YOUR CHARACTER.  I COULD NOT BRING IT INTO PLAY; IT WAS OVERWHELMED,
BURIED, LOST IN THOSE EARLIER FEELINGS WHICH I HAD BEEN SMARTING UNDER
YEAR AFTER YEAR.  I COULD THINK OF YOU ONLY AS ONE WHO HAD YIELDED, WHO
HAD GIVEN ME UP, WHO HAD BEEN INFLUENCED BY ANY ONE RATHER THAN BY ME.
I SAW YOU WITH THE VERY PERSON WHO HAD GUIDED YOU IN THAT YEAR OF
MISERY.  I HAD NO REASON TO BELIEVE HER OF LESS AUTHORITY NOW.  THE
FORCE OF HABIT WAS TO BE ADDED."

"I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT," SAID ANNE, "THAT MY MANNER TO YOURSELF MIGHT
HAVE SPARED YOU MUCH OR ALL OF THIS."

"NO, NO! YOUR MANNER MIGHT BE ONLY THE EASE WHICH YOUR ENGAGEMENT TO
ANOTHER MAN WOULD GIVE.  I LEFT YOU IN THIS BELIEF; AND YET, I WAS
DETERMINED TO SEE YOU AGAIN.  MY SPIRITS RALLIED WITH THE MORNING, AND
I FELT THAT I HAD STILL A MOTIVE FOR REMAINING HERE."

AT LAST ANNE WAS AT HOME AGAIN, AND HAPPIER THAN ANY ONE IN THAT HOUSE
COULD HAVE CONCEIVED.  ALL THE SURPRISE AND SUSPENSE, AND EVERY OTHER
PAINFUL PART OF THE MORNING DISSIPATED BY THIS CONVERSATION, SHE
RE-ENTERED THE HOUSE SO HAPPY AS TO BE OBLIGED TO FIND AN ALLOY IN SOME
MOMENTARY APPREHENSIONS OF ITS BEING IMPOSSIBLE TO LAST.  AN INTERVAL
OF MEDITATION, SERIOUS AND GRATEFUL, WAS THE BEST CORRECTIVE OF
EVERYTHING DANGEROUS IN SUCH HIGH-WROUGHT FELICITY; AND SHE WENT TO HER
ROOM, AND GREW STEADFAST AND FEARLESS IN THE THANKFULNESS OF HER
ENJOYMENT.

THE EVENING CAME, THE DRAWING-ROOMS WERE LIGHTED UP, THE COMPANY
ASSEMBLED.  IT WAS BUT A CARD PARTY, IT WAS BUT A MIXTURE OF THOSE WHO
HAD NEVER MET BEFORE, AND THOSE WHO MET TOO OFTEN; A COMMONPLACE
BUSINESS, TOO NUMEROUS FOR INTIMACY, TOO SMALL FOR VARIETY; BUT ANNE
HAD NEVER FOUND AN EVENING SHORTER.  GLOWING AND LOVELY IN SENSIBILITY
AND HAPPINESS, AND MORE GENERALLY ADMIRED THAN SHE THOUGHT ABOUT OR
CARED FOR, SHE HAD CHEERFUL OR FORBEARING FEELINGS FOR EVERY CREATURE
AROUND HER.  MR ELLIOT WAS THERE; SHE AVOIDED, BUT SHE COULD PITY HIM.
THE WALLISES, SHE HAD AMUSEMENT IN UNDERSTANDING THEM.  LADY DALRYMPLE
AND MISS CARTERET--THEY WOULD SOON BE INNOXIOUS COUSINS TO HER.  SHE
CARED NOT FOR MRS CLAY, AND HAD NOTHING TO BLUSH FOR IN THE PUBLIC
MANNERS OF HER FATHER AND SISTER.  WITH THE MUSGROVES, THERE WAS THE
HAPPY CHAT OF PERFECT EASE; WITH CAPTAIN HARVILLE, THE KIND-HEARTED
INTERCOURSE OF BROTHER AND SISTER; WITH LADY RUSSELL, ATTEMPTS AT
CONVERSATION, WHICH A DELICIOUS CONSCIOUSNESS CUT SHORT; WITH ADMIRAL
AND MRS CROFT, EVERYTHING OF PECULIAR CORDIALITY AND FERVENT INTEREST,
WHICH THE SAME CONSCIOUSNESS SOUGHT TO CONCEAL; AND WITH CAPTAIN
WENTWORTH, SOME MOMENTS OF COMMUNICATIONS CONTINUALLY OCCURRING, AND
ALWAYS THE HOPE OF MORE, AND ALWAYS THE KNOWLEDGE OF HIS BEING THERE.

IT WAS IN ONE OF THESE SHORT MEETINGS, EACH APPARENTLY OCCUPIED IN
ADMIRING A FINE DISPLAY OF GREENHOUSE PLANTS, THAT SHE SAID--

"I HAVE BEEN THINKING OVER THE PAST, AND TRYING IMPARTIALLY TO JUDGE OF
THE RIGHT AND WRONG, I MEAN WITH REGARD TO MYSELF; AND I MUST BELIEVE
THAT I WAS RIGHT, MUCH AS I SUFFERED FROM IT, THAT I WAS PERFECTLY
RIGHT IN BEING GUIDED BY THE FRIEND WHOM YOU WILL LOVE BETTER THAN YOU
DO NOW.  TO ME, SHE WAS IN THE PLACE OF A PARENT.  DO NOT MISTAKE ME,
HOWEVER.  I AM NOT SAYING THAT SHE DID NOT ERR IN HER ADVICE.  IT WAS,
PERHAPS, ONE OF THOSE CASES IN WHICH ADVICE IS GOOD OR BAD ONLY AS THE
EVENT DECIDES; AND FOR MYSELF, I CERTAINLY NEVER SHOULD, IN ANY
CIRCUMSTANCE OF TOLERABLE SIMILARITY, GIVE SUCH ADVICE.  BUT I MEAN,
THAT I WAS RIGHT IN SUBMITTING TO HER, AND THAT IF I HAD DONE
OTHERWISE, I SHOULD HAVE SUFFERED MORE IN CONTINUING THE ENGAGEMENT
THAN I DID EVEN IN GIVING IT UP, BECAUSE I SHOULD HAVE SUFFERED IN MY
CONSCIENCE.  I HAVE NOW, AS FAR AS SUCH A SENTIMENT IS ALLOWABLE IN
HUMAN NATURE, NOTHING TO REPROACH MYSELF WITH; AND IF I MISTAKE NOT, A
STRONG SENSE OF DUTY IS NO BAD PART OF A WOMAN'S PORTION."

HE LOOKED AT HER, LOOKED AT LADY RUSSELL, AND LOOKING AGAIN AT HER,
REPLIED, AS IF IN COOL DELIBERATION--

"NOT YET.  BUT THERE ARE HOPES OF HER BEING FORGIVEN IN TIME.  I TRUST
TO BEING IN CHARITY WITH HER SOON.  BUT I TOO HAVE BEEN THINKING OVER
THE PAST, AND A  QUESTION HAS SUGGESTED ITSELF, WHETHER THERE MAY NOT
HAVE BEEN ONE PERSON MORE MY ENEMY EVEN THAN THAT LADY?  MY OWN SELF.
TELL ME IF, WHEN I RETURNED TO ENGLAND IN THE YEAR EIGHT, WITH A FEW
THOUSAND POUNDS, AND WAS POSTED INTO THE LACONIA, IF I HAD THEN WRITTEN
TO YOU, WOULD YOU HAVE ANSWERED MY LETTER?  WOULD YOU, IN SHORT, HAVE
RENEWED THE ENGAGEMENT THEN?"

"WOULD I!" WAS ALL HER ANSWER; BUT THE ACCENT WAS DECISIVE ENOUGH.

"GOOD GOD!" HE CRIED, "YOU WOULD!  IT IS NOT THAT I DID NOT THINK OF
IT, OR DESIRE IT, AS WHAT COULD ALONE CROWN ALL MY OTHER SUCCESS; BUT I
WAS PROUD, TOO PROUD TO ASK AGAIN.  I DID NOT UNDERSTAND YOU.  I SHUT
MY EYES, AND WOULD NOT UNDERSTAND YOU, OR DO YOU JUSTICE.  THIS IS A
RECOLLECTION WHICH OUGHT TO MAKE ME FORGIVE EVERY ONE SOONER THAN
MYSELF.  SIX YEARS OF SEPARATION AND SUFFERING MIGHT HAVE BEEN SPARED.
IT IS A SORT OF PAIN, TOO, WHICH IS NEW TO ME.  I HAVE BEEN USED TO THE
GRATIFICATION OF BELIEVING MYSELF TO EARN EVERY BLESSING THAT I
ENJOYED.  I HAVE VALUED MYSELF ON HONOURABLE TOILS AND JUST REWARDS.
LIKE OTHER GREAT MEN UNDER REVERSES," HE ADDED, WITH A SMILE. "I MUST
ENDEAVOUR TO SUBDUE MY MIND TO MY FORTUNE.  I MUST LEARN TO BROOK BEING
HAPPIER THAN I DESERVE."



CHAPTER 24


WHO CAN BE IN DOUBT OF WHAT FOLLOWED?  WHEN ANY TWO YOUNG PEOPLE TAKE
IT INTO THEIR HEADS TO MARRY, THEY ARE PRETTY SURE BY PERSEVERANCE TO
CARRY THEIR POINT, BE THEY EVER SO POOR, OR EVER SO IMPRUDENT, OR EVER
SO LITTLE LIKELY TO BE NECESSARY TO EACH OTHER'S ULTIMATE COMFORT.
THIS MAY BE BAD MORALITY TO CONCLUDE WITH, BUT I BELIEVE IT TO BE
TRUTH; AND IF SUCH PARTIES SUCCEED, HOW SHOULD A CAPTAIN WENTWORTH AND
AN ANNE ELLIOT, WITH THE ADVANTAGE OF MATURITY OF MIND, CONSCIOUSNESS
OF RIGHT, AND ONE INDEPENDENT FORTUNE BETWEEN THEM, FAIL OF BEARING
DOWN EVERY OPPOSITION?  THEY MIGHT IN FACT, HAVE BORNE DOWN A GREAT
DEAL MORE THAN THEY MET WITH, FOR THERE WAS LITTLE TO DISTRESS THEM
BEYOND THE WANT OF GRACIOUSNESS AND WARMTH.  SIR WALTER MADE NO
OBJECTION, AND ELIZABETH DID NOTHING WORSE THAN LOOK COLD AND
UNCONCERNED.  CAPTAIN WENTWORTH, WITH FIVE-AND-TWENTY THOUSAND POUNDS,
AND AS HIGH IN HIS PROFESSION AS MERIT AND ACTIVITY COULD PLACE HIM,
WAS NO LONGER NOBODY.  HE WAS NOW ESTEEMED QUITE WORTHY TO ADDRESS THE
DAUGHTER OF A FOOLISH, SPENDTHRIFT BARONET, WHO HAD NOT HAD PRINCIPLE
OR SENSE ENOUGH TO MAINTAIN HIMSELF IN THE SITUATION IN WHICH
PROVIDENCE HAD PLACED HIM, AND WHO COULD GIVE HIS DAUGHTER AT PRESENT
BUT A SMALL PART OF THE SHARE OF TEN THOUSAND POUNDS WHICH MUST BE HERS
HEREAFTER.

SIR WALTER, INDEED, THOUGH HE HAD NO AFFECTION FOR ANNE, AND NO VANITY
FLATTERED, TO MAKE HIM REALLY HAPPY ON THE OCCASION, WAS VERY FAR FROM
THINKING IT A BAD MATCH FOR HER.  ON THE CONTRARY, WHEN HE SAW MORE OF
CAPTAIN WENTWORTH, SAW HIM REPEATEDLY BY DAYLIGHT, AND EYED HIM WELL,
HE WAS VERY MUCH STRUCK BY HIS PERSONAL CLAIMS, AND FELT THAT HIS
SUPERIORITY OF APPEARANCE MIGHT BE NOT UNFAIRLY BALANCED AGAINST HER
SUPERIORITY OF RANK; AND ALL THIS, ASSISTED BY HIS WELL-SOUNDING NAME,
ENABLED SIR WALTER AT LAST TO PREPARE HIS PEN, WITH A VERY GOOD GRACE,
FOR THE INSERTION OF THE MARRIAGE IN THE VOLUME OF HONOUR.

THE ONLY ONE AMONG THEM, WHOSE OPPOSITION OF FEELING COULD EXCITE ANY
SERIOUS ANXIETY WAS LADY RUSSELL.  ANNE KNEW THAT LADY RUSSELL MUST BE
SUFFERING SOME PAIN IN UNDERSTANDING AND RELINQUISHING MR ELLIOT, AND
BE MAKING SOME STRUGGLES TO BECOME TRULY ACQUAINTED WITH, AND DO
JUSTICE TO CAPTAIN WENTWORTH.  THIS HOWEVER WAS WHAT LADY RUSSELL HAD
NOW TO DO.  SHE MUST LEARN TO FEEL THAT SHE HAD BEEN MISTAKEN WITH
REGARD TO BOTH; THAT SHE HAD BEEN UNFAIRLY INFLUENCED BY APPEARANCES IN
EACH; THAT BECAUSE CAPTAIN WENTWORTH'S MANNERS HAD NOT SUITED HER OWN
IDEAS, SHE HAD BEEN TOO QUICK IN SUSPECTING THEM TO INDICATE A
CHARACTER OF DANGEROUS IMPETUOSITY; AND THAT BECAUSE MR ELLIOT'S
MANNERS HAD PRECISELY PLEASED HER IN THEIR PROPRIETY AND CORRECTNESS,
THEIR GENERAL POLITENESS AND SUAVITY, SHE HAD BEEN TOO QUICK IN
RECEIVING THEM AS THE CERTAIN RESULT OF THE MOST CORRECT OPINIONS AND
WELL-REGULATED MIND.  THERE WAS NOTHING LESS FOR LADY RUSSELL TO DO,
THAN TO ADMIT THAT SHE HAD BEEN PRETTY COMPLETELY WRONG, AND TO TAKE UP
A NEW SET OF OPINIONS AND OF HOPES.

THERE IS A QUICKNESS OF PERCEPTION IN SOME, A NICETY IN THE DISCERNMENT
OF CHARACTER, A NATURAL PENETRATION, IN SHORT, WHICH NO EXPERIENCE IN
OTHERS CAN EQUAL, AND LADY RUSSELL HAD BEEN LESS GIFTED IN THIS PART OF
UNDERSTANDING THAN HER YOUNG FRIEND.  BUT SHE WAS A VERY GOOD WOMAN,
AND IF HER SECOND OBJECT WAS TO BE SENSIBLE AND WELL-JUDGING, HER FIRST
WAS TO SEE ANNE HAPPY.  SHE LOVED ANNE BETTER THAN SHE LOVED HER OWN
ABILITIES; AND WHEN THE AWKWARDNESS OF THE BEGINNING WAS OVER, FOUND
LITTLE HARDSHIP IN ATTACHING HERSELF AS A MOTHER TO THE MAN WHO WAS
SECURING THE HAPPINESS OF HER OTHER CHILD.

OF ALL THE FAMILY, MARY WAS PROBABLY THE ONE MOST IMMEDIATELY GRATIFIED
BY THE CIRCUMSTANCE.  IT WAS CREDITABLE TO HAVE A SISTER MARRIED, AND
SHE MIGHT FLATTER HERSELF WITH HAVING BEEN GREATLY INSTRUMENTAL TO THE
CONNEXION, BY KEEPING ANNE WITH HER IN THE AUTUMN; AND AS HER OWN
SISTER MUST BE BETTER THAN HER HUSBAND'S SISTERS, IT WAS VERY AGREEABLE
THAT CAPTAIN WENTWORTH SHOULD BE A RICHER MAN THAN EITHER CAPTAIN
BENWICK OR CHARLES HAYTER.  SHE HAD SOMETHING TO SUFFER, PERHAPS, WHEN
THEY CAME INTO CONTACT AGAIN, IN SEEING ANNE RESTORED TO THE RIGHTS OF
SENIORITY, AND THE MISTRESS OF A VERY PRETTY LANDAULETTE; BUT SHE HAD A
FUTURE TO LOOK FORWARD TO, OF POWERFUL CONSOLATION.  ANNE HAD NO
UPPERCROSS HALL BEFORE HER, NO LANDED ESTATE, NO HEADSHIP OF A FAMILY;
AND IF THEY COULD BUT KEEP CAPTAIN WENTWORTH FROM BEING MADE A BARONET,
SHE WOULD NOT CHANGE SITUATIONS WITH ANNE.

IT WOULD BE WELL FOR THE ELDEST SISTER IF SHE WERE EQUALLY SATISFIED
WITH HER SITUATION, FOR A CHANGE IS NOT VERY PROBABLE THERE.  SHE HAD
SOON THE MORTIFICATION OF SEEING MR ELLIOT WITHDRAW, AND NO ONE OF
PROPER CONDITION HAS SINCE PRESENTED HIMSELF TO RAISE EVEN THE
UNFOUNDED HOPES WHICH SUNK WITH HIM.

THE NEWS OF HIS COUSINS ANNE'S ENGAGEMENT BURST ON MR ELLIOT MOST
UNEXPECTEDLY.  IT DERANGED HIS BEST PLAN OF DOMESTIC HAPPINESS, HIS
BEST HOPE OF KEEPING SIR WALTER SINGLE BY THE WATCHFULNESS WHICH A
SON-IN-LAW'S RIGHTS WOULD HAVE GIVEN.  BUT, THOUGH DISCOMFITED AND
DISAPPOINTED, HE COULD STILL DO SOMETHING FOR HIS OWN INTEREST AND HIS
OWN ENJOYMENT.  HE SOON QUITTED BATH; AND ON MRS CLAY'S QUITTING IT
SOON AFTERWARDS, AND BEING NEXT HEARD OF AS ESTABLISHED UNDER HIS
PROTECTION IN LONDON, IT WAS EVIDENT HOW DOUBLE A GAME HE HAD BEEN
PLAYING, AND HOW DETERMINED HE WAS TO SAVE HIMSELF FROM BEING CUT OUT
BY ONE ARTFUL WOMAN, AT LEAST.

MRS CLAY'S AFFECTIONS HAD OVERPOWERED HER INTEREST, AND SHE HAD
SACRIFICED, FOR THE YOUNG MAN'S SAKE, THE POSSIBILITY OF SCHEMING
LONGER FOR SIR WALTER.  SHE HAS ABILITIES, HOWEVER, AS WELL AS
AFFECTIONS; AND IT IS NOW A DOUBTFUL POINT WHETHER HIS CUNNING, OR
HERS, MAY FINALLY CARRY THE DAY; WHETHER, AFTER PREVENTING HER FROM
BEING THE WIFE OF SIR WALTER, HE MAY NOT BE WHEEDLED AND CARESSED AT
LAST INTO MAKING HER THE WIFE OF SIR WILLIAM.

IT CANNOT BE DOUBTED THAT SIR WALTER AND ELIZABETH WERE SHOCKED AND
MORTIFIED BY THE LOSS OF THEIR COMPANION, AND THE DISCOVERY OF THEIR
DECEPTION IN HER.  THEY HAD THEIR GREAT COUSINS, TO BE SURE, TO RESORT
TO FOR COMFORT; BUT THEY MUST LONG FEEL THAT TO FLATTER AND FOLLOW
OTHERS, WITHOUT BEING FLATTERED AND FOLLOWED IN TURN, IS BUT A STATE OF
HALF ENJOYMENT.

ANNE, SATISFIED AT A VERY EARLY PERIOD OF LADY RUSSELL'S MEANING TO
LOVE CAPTAIN WENTWORTH AS SHE OUGHT, HAD NO OTHER ALLOY TO THE
HAPPINESS OF HER PROSPECTS THAN WHAT AROSE FROM THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF
HAVING NO RELATIONS TO BESTOW ON HIM WHICH A MAN OF SENSE COULD VALUE.
THERE SHE FELT HER OWN INFERIORITY VERY KEENLY.  THE DISPROPORTION IN
THEIR FORTUNE WAS NOTHING; IT DID NOT GIVE HER A MOMENT'S REGRET; BUT
TO HAVE NO FAMILY TO RECEIVE AND ESTIMATE HIM PROPERLY, NOTHING OF
RESPECTABILITY, OF HARMONY, OF GOOD WILL TO OFFER IN RETURN FOR ALL THE
WORTH AND ALL THE PROMPT WELCOME WHICH MET HER IN HIS BROTHERS AND
SISTERS, WAS A SOURCE OF AS LIVELY PAIN AS HER MIND COULD WELL BE
SENSIBLE OF UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES OF OTHERWISE STRONG FELICITY.  SHE HAD
BUT TWO FRIENDS IN THE WORLD TO ADD TO HIS LIST, LADY RUSSELL AND MRS
SMITH.  TO THOSE, HOWEVER, HE WAS VERY WELL DISPOSED TO ATTACH HIMSELF.
LADY RUSSELL, IN SPITE OF ALL HER FORMER TRANSGRESSIONS, HE COULD NOW
VALUE FROM HIS HEART.  WHILE HE WAS NOT OBLIGED TO SAY THAT HE BELIEVED
HER TO HAVE BEEN RIGHT IN ORIGINALLY DIVIDING THEM, HE WAS READY TO SAY
ALMOST EVERYTHING ELSE IN HER FAVOUR, AND AS FOR MRS SMITH, SHE HAD
CLAIMS OF VARIOUS KINDS TO RECOMMEND HER QUICKLY AND PERMANENTLY.

HER RECENT GOOD OFFICES BY ANNE HAD BEEN ENOUGH IN THEMSELVES, AND
THEIR MARRIAGE, INSTEAD OF DEPRIVING HER OF ONE FRIEND, SECURED HER
TWO.  SHE WAS THEIR EARLIEST VISITOR IN THEIR SETTLED LIFE; AND CAPTAIN
WENTWORTH, BY PUTTING HER IN THE WAY OF RECOVERING HER HUSBAND'S
PROPERTY IN THE WEST INDIES, BY WRITING FOR HER, ACTING FOR HER, AND
SEEING HER THROUGH ALL THE PETTY DIFFICULTIES OF THE CASE WITH THE
ACTIVITY AND EXERTION OF A FEARLESS MAN AND A DETERMINED FRIEND, FULLY
REQUITED THE SERVICES WHICH SHE HAD RENDERED, OR EVER MEANT TO RENDER,
TO HIS WIFE.

MRS SMITH'S ENJOYMENTS WERE NOT SPOILED BY THIS IMPROVEMENT OF INCOME,
WITH SOME IMPROVEMENT OF HEALTH, AND THE ACQUISITION OF SUCH FRIENDS TO
BE OFTEN WITH, FOR HER CHEERFULNESS AND MENTAL ALACRITY DID NOT FAIL
HER; AND WHILE THESE PRIME SUPPLIES OF GOOD REMAINED, SHE MIGHT HAVE
BID DEFIANCE EVEN TO GREATER ACCESSIONS OF WORLDLY PROSPERITY.  SHE
MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABSOLUTELY RICH AND PERFECTLY HEALTHY, AND YET BE
HAPPY.  HER SPRING OF FELICITY WAS IN THE GLOW OF HER SPIRITS, AS HER
FRIEND ANNE'S WAS IN THE WARMTH OF HER HEART.  ANNE WAS TENDERNESS
ITSELF, AND SHE HAD THE FULL WORTH OF IT IN CAPTAIN WENTWORTH'S
AFFECTION.  HIS PROFESSION WAS ALL THAT COULD EVER MAKE HER FRIENDS
WISH THAT TENDERNESS LESS, THE DREAD OF A FUTURE WAR ALL THAT COULD DIM
HER SUNSHINE.  SHE GLORIED IN BEING A SAILOR'S WIFE, BUT SHE MUST PAY
THE TAX OF QUICK ALARM FOR BELONGING TO THAT PROFESSION WHICH IS, IF
POSSIBLE, MORE DISTINGUISHED IN ITS DOMESTIC VIRTUES THAN IN ITS
NATIONAL IMPORTANCE.

ADVERTISEMENT BY THE AUTHORESS, TO NORTHANGER ABBEY

THIS LITTLE WORK WAS FINISHED IN THE YEAR 1803, AND INTENDED FOR
IMMEDIATE PUBLICATION. IT WAS DISPOSED OF TO A BOOKSELLER, IT WAS EVEN
ADVERTISED, AND WHY THE BUSINESS PROCEEDED NO FARTHER, THE AUTHOR
HAS NEVER BEEN ABLE TO LEARN. THAT ANY BOOKSELLER SHOULD THINK IT
WORTH-WHILE TO PURCHASE WHAT HE DID NOT THINK IT WORTH-WHILE TO PUBLISH
SEEMS EXTRAORDINARY. BUT WITH THIS, NEITHER THE AUTHOR NOR THE PUBLIC
HAVE ANY OTHER CONCERN THAN AS SOME OBSERVATION IS NECESSARY UPON THOSE
PARTS OF THE WORK WHICH THIRTEEN YEARS HAVE MADE COMPARATIVELY OBSOLETE.
THE PUBLIC ARE ENTREATED TO BEAR IN MIND THAT THIRTEEN YEARS HAVE PASSED
SINCE IT WAS FINISHED, MANY MORE SINCE IT WAS BEGUN, AND THAT DURING
THAT PERIOD, PLACES, MANNERS, BOOKS, AND OPINIONS HAVE UNDERGONE
CONSIDERABLE CHANGES.



CHAPTER 1


NO ONE WHO HAD EVER SEEN CATHERINE MORLAND IN HER INFANCY WOULD HAVE
SUPPOSED HER BORN TO BE AN HEROINE. HER SITUATION IN LIFE, THE CHARACTER
OF HER FATHER AND MOTHER, HER OWN PERSON AND DISPOSITION, WERE
ALL EQUALLY AGAINST HER. HER FATHER WAS A CLERGYMAN, WITHOUT BEING
NEGLECTED, OR POOR, AND A VERY RESPECTABLE MAN, THOUGH HIS NAME
WAS RICHARD--AND HE HAD NEVER BEEN HANDSOME. HE HAD A CONSIDERABLE
INDEPENDENCE BESIDES TWO GOOD LIVINGS--AND HE WAS NOT IN THE LEAST
ADDICTED TO LOCKING UP HIS DAUGHTERS. HER MOTHER WAS A WOMAN OF USEFUL
PLAIN SENSE, WITH A GOOD TEMPER, AND, WHAT IS MORE REMARKABLE, WITH A
GOOD CONSTITUTION. SHE HAD THREE SONS BEFORE CATHERINE WAS BORN; AND
INSTEAD OF DYING IN BRINGING THE LATTER INTO THE WORLD, AS ANYBODY MIGHT
EXPECT, SHE STILL LIVED ON--LIVED TO HAVE SIX CHILDREN MORE--TO SEE THEM
GROWING UP AROUND HER, AND TO ENJOY EXCELLENT HEALTH HERSELF. A FAMILY
OF TEN CHILDREN WILL BE ALWAYS CALLED A FINE FAMILY, WHERE THERE ARE
HEADS AND ARMS AND LEGS ENOUGH FOR THE NUMBER; BUT THE MORLANDS HAD
LITTLE OTHER RIGHT TO THE WORD, FOR THEY WERE IN GENERAL VERY PLAIN, AND
CATHERINE, FOR MANY YEARS OF HER LIFE, AS PLAIN AS ANY. SHE HAD A THIN
AWKWARD FIGURE, A SALLOW SKIN WITHOUT COLOUR, DARK LANK HAIR, AND STRONG
FEATURES--SO MUCH FOR HER PERSON; AND NOT LESS UNPROPITIOUS FOR HEROISM
SEEMED HER MIND. SHE WAS FOND OF ALL BOY'S PLAYS, AND GREATLY PREFERRED
CRICKET NOT MERELY TO DOLLS, BUT TO THE MORE HEROIC ENJOYMENTS OF
INFANCY, NURSING A DORMOUSE, FEEDING A CANARY-BIRD, OR WATERING A
ROSE-BUSH. INDEED SHE HAD NO TASTE FOR A GARDEN; AND IF SHE GATHERED
FLOWERS AT ALL, IT WAS CHIEFLY FOR THE PLEASURE OF MISCHIEF--AT LEAST
SO IT WAS CONJECTURED FROM HER ALWAYS PREFERRING THOSE WHICH SHE WAS
FORBIDDEN TO TAKE. SUCH WERE HER PROPENSITIES--HER ABILITIES WERE QUITE
AS EXTRAORDINARY. SHE NEVER COULD LEARN OR UNDERSTAND ANYTHING
BEFORE SHE WAS TAUGHT; AND SOMETIMES NOT EVEN THEN, FOR SHE WAS OFTEN
INATTENTIVE, AND OCCASIONALLY STUPID. HER MOTHER WAS THREE MONTHS IN
TEACHING HER ONLY TO REPEAT THE "BEGGAR'S PETITION"; AND AFTER ALL, HER
NEXT SISTER, SALLY, COULD SAY IT BETTER THAN SHE DID. NOT THAT CATHERINE
WAS ALWAYS STUPID--BY NO MEANS; SHE LEARNT THE FABLE OF "THE HARE AND
MANY FRIENDS" AS QUICKLY AS ANY GIRL IN ENGLAND. HER MOTHER WISHED HER
TO LEARN MUSIC; AND CATHERINE WAS SURE SHE SHOULD LIKE IT, FOR SHE WAS
VERY FOND OF TINKLING THE KEYS OF THE OLD FORLORN SPINNET; SO, AT EIGHT
YEARS OLD SHE BEGAN. SHE LEARNT A YEAR, AND COULD NOT BEAR IT; AND MRS.
MORLAND, WHO DID NOT INSIST ON HER DAUGHTERS BEING ACCOMPLISHED IN
SPITE OF INCAPACITY OR DISTASTE, ALLOWED HER TO LEAVE OFF. THE DAY WHICH
DISMISSED THE MUSIC-MASTER WAS ONE OF THE HAPPIEST OF CATHERINE'S LIFE.
HER TASTE FOR DRAWING WAS NOT SUPERIOR; THOUGH WHENEVER SHE COULD OBTAIN
THE OUTSIDE OF A LETTER FROM HER MOTHER OR SEIZE UPON ANY OTHER ODD
PIECE OF PAPER, SHE DID WHAT SHE COULD IN THAT WAY, BY DRAWING HOUSES
AND TREES, HENS AND CHICKENS, ALL VERY MUCH LIKE ONE ANOTHER. WRITING
AND ACCOUNTS SHE WAS TAUGHT BY HER FATHER; FRENCH BY HER MOTHER: HER
PROFICIENCY IN EITHER WAS NOT REMARKABLE, AND SHE SHIRKED HER LESSONS IN
BOTH WHENEVER SHE COULD. WHAT A STRANGE, UNACCOUNTABLE CHARACTER!--FOR
WITH ALL THESE SYMPTOMS OF PROFLIGACY AT TEN YEARS OLD, SHE HAD NEITHER
A BAD HEART NOR A BAD TEMPER, WAS SELDOM STUBBORN, SCARCELY EVER
QUARRELSOME, AND VERY KIND TO THE LITTLE ONES, WITH FEW INTERRUPTIONS
OF TYRANNY; SHE WAS MOREOVER NOISY AND WILD, HATED CONFINEMENT AND
CLEANLINESS, AND LOVED NOTHING SO WELL IN THE WORLD AS ROLLING DOWN THE
GREEN SLOPE AT THE BACK OF THE HOUSE.

SUCH WAS CATHERINE MORLAND AT TEN. AT FIFTEEN, APPEARANCES WERE MENDING;
SHE BEGAN TO CURL HER HAIR AND LONG FOR BALLS; HER COMPLEXION IMPROVED,
HER FEATURES WERE SOFTENED BY PLUMPNESS AND COLOUR, HER EYES GAINED MORE
ANIMATION, AND HER FIGURE MORE CONSEQUENCE. HER LOVE OF DIRT GAVE WAY TO
AN INCLINATION FOR FINERY, AND SHE GREW CLEAN AS SHE GREW SMART; SHE HAD
NOW THE PLEASURE OF SOMETIMES HEARING HER FATHER AND MOTHER REMARK
ON HER PERSONAL IMPROVEMENT. "CATHERINE GROWS QUITE A GOOD-LOOKING
GIRL--SHE IS ALMOST PRETTY TODAY," WERE WORDS WHICH CAUGHT HER EARS NOW
AND THEN; AND HOW WELCOME WERE THE SOUNDS! TO LOOK ALMOST PRETTY IS AN
ACQUISITION OF HIGHER DELIGHT TO A GIRL WHO HAS BEEN LOOKING PLAIN THE
FIRST FIFTEEN YEARS OF HER LIFE THAN A BEAUTY FROM HER CRADLE CAN EVER
RECEIVE.

MRS. MORLAND WAS A VERY GOOD WOMAN, AND WISHED TO SEE HER CHILDREN
EVERYTHING THEY OUGHT TO BE; BUT HER TIME WAS SO MUCH OCCUPIED IN
LYING-IN AND TEACHING THE LITTLE ONES, THAT HER ELDER DAUGHTERS WERE
INEVITABLY LEFT TO SHIFT FOR THEMSELVES; AND IT WAS NOT VERY WONDERFUL
THAT CATHERINE, WHO HAD BY NATURE NOTHING HEROIC ABOUT HER, SHOULD
PREFER CRICKET, BASEBALL, RIDING ON HORSEBACK, AND RUNNING ABOUT
THE COUNTRY AT THE AGE OF FOURTEEN, TO BOOKS--OR AT LEAST BOOKS OF
INFORMATION--FOR, PROVIDED THAT NOTHING LIKE USEFUL KNOWLEDGE COULD BE
GAINED FROM THEM, PROVIDED THEY WERE ALL STORY AND NO REFLECTION, SHE
HAD NEVER ANY OBJECTION TO BOOKS AT ALL. BUT FROM FIFTEEN TO SEVENTEEN
SHE WAS IN TRAINING FOR A HEROINE; SHE READ ALL SUCH WORKS AS HEROINES
MUST READ TO SUPPLY THEIR MEMORIES WITH THOSE QUOTATIONS WHICH ARE SO
SERVICEABLE AND SO SOOTHING IN THE VICISSITUDES OF THEIR EVENTFUL LIVES.

FROM POPE, SHE LEARNT TO CENSURE THOSE WHO

   "BEAR ABOUT THE MOCKERY OF WOE."


FROM GRAY, THAT

   "MANY A FLOWER IS BORN TO BLUSH UNSEEN,
   "AND WASTE ITS FRAGRANCE ON THE DESERT AIR."


FROM THOMPSON, THAT--

   "IT IS A DELIGHTFUL TASK
   "TO TEACH THE YOUNG IDEA HOW TO SHOOT."


AND FROM SHAKESPEARE SHE GAINED A GREAT STORE OF INFORMATION--AMONGST
THE REST, THAT--

   "TRIFLES LIGHT AS AIR,
   "ARE, TO THE JEALOUS, CONFIRMATION STRONG,
   "AS PROOFS OF HOLY WRIT."


THAT

   "THE POOR BEETLE, WHICH WE TREAD UPON,
   "IN CORPORAL SUFFERANCE FEELS A PANG AS GREAT
   "AS WHEN A GIANT DIES."


AND THAT A YOUNG WOMAN IN LOVE ALWAYS LOOKS--

   "LIKE PATIENCE ON A MONUMENT
   "SMILING AT GRIEF."


SO FAR HER IMPROVEMENT WAS SUFFICIENT--AND IN MANY OTHER POINTS SHE CAME
ON EXCEEDINGLY WELL; FOR THOUGH SHE COULD NOT WRITE SONNETS, SHE BROUGHT
HERSELF TO READ THEM; AND THOUGH THERE SEEMED NO CHANCE OF HER THROWING
A WHOLE PARTY INTO RAPTURES BY A PRELUDE ON THE PIANOFORTE, OF HER OWN
COMPOSITION, SHE COULD LISTEN TO OTHER PEOPLE'S PERFORMANCE WITH VERY
LITTLE FATIGUE. HER GREATEST DEFICIENCY WAS IN THE PENCIL--SHE HAD NO
NOTION OF DRAWING--NOT ENOUGH EVEN TO ATTEMPT A SKETCH OF HER LOVER'S
PROFILE, THAT SHE MIGHT BE DETECTED IN THE DESIGN. THERE SHE FELL
MISERABLY SHORT OF THE TRUE HEROIC HEIGHT. AT PRESENT SHE DID NOT KNOW
HER OWN POVERTY, FOR SHE HAD NO LOVER TO PORTRAY. SHE HAD REACHED THE
AGE OF SEVENTEEN, WITHOUT HAVING SEEN ONE AMIABLE YOUTH WHO COULD CALL
FORTH HER SENSIBILITY, WITHOUT HAVING INSPIRED ONE REAL PASSION, AND
WITHOUT HAVING EXCITED EVEN ANY ADMIRATION BUT WHAT WAS VERY MODERATE
AND VERY TRANSIENT. THIS WAS STRANGE INDEED! BUT STRANGE THINGS MAY BE
GENERALLY ACCOUNTED FOR IF THEIR CAUSE BE FAIRLY SEARCHED OUT. THERE WAS
NOT ONE LORD IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD; NO--NOT EVEN A BARONET. THERE WAS NOT
ONE FAMILY AMONG THEIR ACQUAINTANCE WHO HAD REARED AND SUPPORTED A BOY
ACCIDENTALLY FOUND AT THEIR DOOR--NOT ONE YOUNG MAN WHOSE ORIGIN
WAS UNKNOWN. HER FATHER HAD NO WARD, AND THE SQUIRE OF THE PARISH NO
CHILDREN.

BUT WHEN A YOUNG LADY IS TO BE A HEROINE, THE PERVERSENESS OF FORTY
SURROUNDING FAMILIES CANNOT PREVENT HER. SOMETHING MUST AND WILL HAPPEN
TO THROW A HERO IN HER WAY.

MR. ALLEN, WHO OWNED THE CHIEF OF THE PROPERTY ABOUT FULLERTON, THE
VILLAGE IN WILTSHIRE WHERE THE MORLANDS LIVED, WAS ORDERED TO BATH
FOR THE BENEFIT OF A GOUTY CONSTITUTION--AND HIS LADY, A GOOD-HUMOURED
WOMAN, FOND OF MISS MORLAND, AND PROBABLY AWARE THAT IF ADVENTURES WILL
NOT BEFALL A YOUNG LADY IN HER OWN VILLAGE, SHE MUST SEEK THEM ABROAD,
INVITED HER TO GO WITH THEM. MR. AND MRS. MORLAND WERE ALL COMPLIANCE,
AND CATHERINE ALL HAPPINESS.




CHAPTER 2


IN ADDITION TO WHAT HAS BEEN ALREADY SAID OF CATHERINE MORLAND'S
PERSONAL AND MENTAL ENDOWMENTS, WHEN ABOUT TO BE LAUNCHED INTO ALL THE
DIFFICULTIES AND DANGERS OF A SIX WEEKS' RESIDENCE IN BATH, IT MAY BE
STATED, FOR THE READER'S MORE CERTAIN INFORMATION, LEST THE FOLLOWING
PAGES SHOULD OTHERWISE FAIL OF GIVING ANY IDEA OF WHAT HER CHARACTER IS
MEANT TO BE, THAT HER HEART WAS AFFECTIONATE; HER DISPOSITION CHEERFUL
AND OPEN, WITHOUT CONCEIT OR AFFECTATION OF ANY KIND--HER MANNERS JUST
REMOVED FROM THE AWKWARDNESS AND SHYNESS OF A GIRL; HER PERSON PLEASING,
AND, WHEN IN GOOD LOOKS, PRETTY--AND HER MIND ABOUT AS IGNORANT AND
UNINFORMED AS THE FEMALE MIND AT SEVENTEEN USUALLY IS.

WHEN THE HOUR OF DEPARTURE DREW NEAR, THE MATERNAL ANXIETY OF MRS.
MORLAND WILL BE NATURALLY SUPPOSED TO BE MOST SEVERE. A THOUSAND
ALARMING PRESENTIMENTS OF EVIL TO HER BELOVED CATHERINE FROM THIS
TERRIFIC SEPARATION MUST OPPRESS HER HEART WITH SADNESS, AND DROWN HER
IN TEARS FOR THE LAST DAY OR TWO OF THEIR BEING TOGETHER; AND ADVICE OF
THE MOST IMPORTANT AND APPLICABLE NATURE MUST OF COURSE FLOW FROM HER
WISE LIPS IN THEIR PARTING CONFERENCE IN HER CLOSET. CAUTIONS AGAINST
THE VIOLENCE OF SUCH NOBLEMEN AND BARONETS AS DELIGHT IN FORCING YOUNG
LADIES AWAY TO SOME REMOTE FARM-HOUSE, MUST, AT SUCH A MOMENT, RELIEVE
THE FULNESS OF HER HEART. WHO WOULD NOT THINK SO? BUT MRS. MORLAND KNEW
SO LITTLE OF LORDS AND BARONETS, THAT SHE ENTERTAINED NO NOTION OF THEIR
GENERAL MISCHIEVOUSNESS, AND WAS WHOLLY UNSUSPICIOUS OF DANGER TO HER
DAUGHTER FROM THEIR MACHINATIONS. HER CAUTIONS WERE CONFINED TO THE
FOLLOWING POINTS. "I BEG, CATHERINE, YOU WILL ALWAYS WRAP YOURSELF UP
VERY WARM ABOUT THE THROAT, WHEN YOU COME FROM THE ROOMS AT NIGHT; AND
I WISH YOU WOULD TRY TO KEEP SOME ACCOUNT OF THE MONEY YOU SPEND; I WILL
GIVE YOU THIS LITTLE BOOK ON PURPOSE."

SALLY, OR RATHER SARAH (FOR WHAT YOUNG LADY OF COMMON GENTILITY WILL
REACH THE AGE OF SIXTEEN WITHOUT ALTERING HER NAME AS FAR AS SHE CAN?),
MUST FROM SITUATION BE AT THIS TIME THE INTIMATE FRIEND AND CONFIDANTE
OF HER SISTER. IT IS REMARKABLE, HOWEVER, THAT SHE NEITHER INSISTED
ON CATHERINE'S WRITING BY EVERY POST, NOR EXACTED HER PROMISE OF
TRANSMITTING THE CHARACTER OF EVERY NEW ACQUAINTANCE, NOR A DETAIL
OF EVERY INTERESTING CONVERSATION THAT BATH MIGHT PRODUCE. EVERYTHING
INDEED RELATIVE TO THIS IMPORTANT JOURNEY WAS DONE, ON THE PART OF THE
MORLANDS, WITH A DEGREE OF MODERATION AND COMPOSURE, WHICH SEEMED
RATHER CONSISTENT WITH THE COMMON FEELINGS OF COMMON LIFE, THAN WITH THE
REFINED SUSCEPTIBILITIES, THE TENDER EMOTIONS WHICH THE FIRST SEPARATION
OF A HEROINE FROM HER FAMILY OUGHT ALWAYS TO EXCITE. HER FATHER, INSTEAD
OF GIVING HER AN UNLIMITED ORDER ON HIS BANKER, OR EVEN PUTTING AN
HUNDRED POUNDS BANK-BILL INTO HER HANDS, GAVE HER ONLY TEN GUINEAS, AND
PROMISED HER MORE WHEN SHE WANTED IT.

UNDER THESE UNPROMISING AUSPICES, THE PARTING TOOK PLACE, AND THE
JOURNEY BEGAN. IT WAS PERFORMED WITH SUITABLE QUIETNESS AND UNEVENTFUL
SAFETY. NEITHER ROBBERS NOR TEMPESTS BEFRIENDED THEM, NOR ONE LUCKY
OVERTURN TO INTRODUCE THEM TO THE HERO. NOTHING MORE ALARMING OCCURRED
THAN A FEAR, ON MRS. ALLEN'S SIDE, OF HAVING ONCE LEFT HER CLOGS BEHIND
HER AT AN INN, AND THAT FORTUNATELY PROVED TO BE GROUNDLESS.

THEY ARRIVED AT BATH. CATHERINE WAS ALL EAGER DELIGHT--HER EYES WERE
HERE, THERE, EVERYWHERE, AS THEY APPROACHED ITS FINE AND STRIKING
ENVIRONS, AND AFTERWARDS DROVE THROUGH THOSE STREETS WHICH CONDUCTED
THEM TO THE HOTEL. SHE WAS COME TO BE HAPPY, AND SHE FELT HAPPY ALREADY.

THEY WERE SOON SETTLED IN COMFORTABLE LODGINGS IN PULTENEY STREET.

IT IS NOW EXPEDIENT TO GIVE SOME DESCRIPTION OF MRS. ALLEN, THAT THE
READER MAY BE ABLE TO JUDGE IN WHAT MANNER HER ACTIONS WILL HEREAFTER
TEND TO PROMOTE THE GENERAL DISTRESS OF THE WORK, AND HOW SHE WILL,
PROBABLY, CONTRIBUTE TO REDUCE POOR CATHERINE TO ALL THE DESPERATE
WRETCHEDNESS OF WHICH A LAST VOLUME IS CAPABLE--WHETHER BY HER
IMPRUDENCE, VULGARITY, OR JEALOUSY--WHETHER BY INTERCEPTING HER LETTERS,
RUINING HER CHARACTER, OR TURNING HER OUT OF DOORS.

MRS. ALLEN WAS ONE OF THAT NUMEROUS CLASS OF FEMALES, WHOSE SOCIETY CAN
RAISE NO OTHER EMOTION THAN SURPRISE AT THERE BEING ANY MEN IN THE WORLD
WHO COULD LIKE THEM WELL ENOUGH TO MARRY THEM. SHE HAD NEITHER BEAUTY,
GENIUS, ACCOMPLISHMENT, NOR MANNER. THE AIR OF A GENTLEWOMAN, A GREAT
DEAL OF QUIET, INACTIVE GOOD TEMPER, AND A TRIFLING TURN OF MIND
WERE ALL THAT COULD ACCOUNT FOR HER BEING THE CHOICE OF A SENSIBLE,
INTELLIGENT MAN LIKE MR. ALLEN. IN ONE RESPECT SHE WAS ADMIRABLY FITTED
TO INTRODUCE A YOUNG LADY INTO PUBLIC, BEING AS FOND OF GOING EVERYWHERE
AND SEEING EVERYTHING HERSELF AS ANY YOUNG LADY COULD BE. DRESS WAS
HER PASSION. SHE HAD A MOST HARMLESS DELIGHT IN BEING FINE; AND OUR
HEROINE'S ENTREE INTO LIFE COULD NOT TAKE PLACE TILL AFTER THREE OR FOUR
DAYS HAD BEEN SPENT IN LEARNING WHAT WAS MOSTLY WORN, AND HER CHAPERONE
WAS PROVIDED WITH A DRESS OF THE NEWEST FASHION. CATHERINE TOO MADE
SOME PURCHASES HERSELF, AND WHEN ALL THESE MATTERS WERE ARRANGED, THE
IMPORTANT EVENING CAME WHICH WAS TO USHER HER INTO THE UPPER ROOMS. HER
HAIR WAS CUT AND DRESSED BY THE BEST HAND, HER CLOTHES PUT ON WITH CARE,
AND BOTH MRS. ALLEN AND HER MAID DECLARED SHE LOOKED QUITE AS SHE SHOULD
DO. WITH SUCH ENCOURAGEMENT, CATHERINE HOPED AT LEAST TO PASS UNCENSURED
THROUGH THE CROWD. AS FOR ADMIRATION, IT WAS ALWAYS VERY WELCOME WHEN IT
CAME, BUT SHE DID NOT DEPEND ON IT.

MRS. ALLEN WAS SO LONG IN DRESSING THAT THEY DID NOT ENTER THE BALLROOM
TILL LATE. THE SEASON WAS FULL, THE ROOM CROWDED, AND THE TWO LADIES
SQUEEZED IN AS WELL AS THEY COULD. AS FOR MR. ALLEN, HE REPAIRED
DIRECTLY TO THE CARD-ROOM, AND LEFT THEM TO ENJOY A MOB BY THEMSELVES.
WITH MORE CARE FOR THE SAFETY OF HER NEW GOWN THAN FOR THE COMFORT OF
HER PROTEGEE, MRS. ALLEN MADE HER WAY THROUGH THE THRONG OF MEN BY
THE DOOR, AS SWIFTLY AS THE NECESSARY CAUTION WOULD ALLOW; CATHERINE,
HOWEVER, KEPT CLOSE AT HER SIDE, AND LINKED HER ARM TOO FIRMLY WITHIN
HER FRIEND'S TO BE TORN ASUNDER BY ANY COMMON EFFORT OF A STRUGGLING
ASSEMBLY. BUT TO HER UTTER AMAZEMENT SHE FOUND THAT TO PROCEED ALONG THE
ROOM WAS BY NO MEANS THE WAY TO DISENGAGE THEMSELVES FROM THE CROWD; IT
SEEMED RATHER TO INCREASE AS THEY WENT ON, WHEREAS SHE HAD IMAGINED THAT
WHEN ONCE FAIRLY WITHIN THE DOOR, THEY SHOULD EASILY FIND SEATS AND BE
ABLE TO WATCH THE DANCES WITH PERFECT CONVENIENCE. BUT THIS WAS FAR FROM
BEING THE CASE, AND THOUGH BY UNWEARIED DILIGENCE THEY GAINED EVEN THE
TOP OF THE ROOM, THEIR SITUATION WAS JUST THE SAME; THEY SAW NOTHING
OF THE DANCERS BUT THE HIGH FEATHERS OF SOME OF THE LADIES. STILL THEY
MOVED ON--SOMETHING BETTER WAS YET IN VIEW; AND BY A CONTINUED EXERTION
OF STRENGTH AND INGENUITY THEY FOUND THEMSELVES AT LAST IN THE PASSAGE
BEHIND THE HIGHEST BENCH. HERE THERE WAS SOMETHING LESS OF CROWD THAN
BELOW; AND HENCE MISS MORLAND HAD A COMPREHENSIVE VIEW OF ALL THE
COMPANY BENEATH HER, AND OF ALL THE DANGERS OF HER LATE PASSAGE THROUGH
THEM. IT WAS A SPLENDID SIGHT, AND SHE BEGAN, FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT
EVENING, TO FEEL HERSELF AT A BALL: SHE LONGED TO DANCE, BUT SHE HAD
NOT AN ACQUAINTANCE IN THE ROOM. MRS. ALLEN DID ALL THAT SHE COULD DO
IN SUCH A CASE BY SAYING VERY PLACIDLY, EVERY NOW AND THEN, "I WISH YOU
COULD DANCE, MY DEAR--I WISH YOU COULD GET A PARTNER." FOR SOME TIME
HER YOUNG FRIEND FELT OBLIGED TO HER FOR THESE WISHES; BUT THEY WERE
REPEATED SO OFTEN, AND PROVED SO TOTALLY INEFFECTUAL, THAT CATHERINE
GREW TIRED AT LAST, AND WOULD THANK HER NO MORE.

THEY WERE NOT LONG ABLE, HOWEVER, TO ENJOY THE REPOSE OF THE EMINENCE
THEY HAD SO LABORIOUSLY GAINED. EVERYBODY WAS SHORTLY IN MOTION FOR
TEA, AND THEY MUST SQUEEZE OUT LIKE THE REST. CATHERINE BEGAN TO FEEL
SOMETHING OF DISAPPOINTMENT--SHE WAS TIRED OF BEING CONTINUALLY PRESSED
AGAINST BY PEOPLE, THE GENERALITY OF WHOSE FACES POSSESSED NOTHING TO
INTEREST, AND WITH ALL OF WHOM SHE WAS SO WHOLLY UNACQUAINTED THAT SHE
COULD NOT RELIEVE THE IRKSOMENESS OF IMPRISONMENT BY THE EXCHANGE OF A
SYLLABLE WITH ANY OF HER FELLOW CAPTIVES; AND WHEN AT LAST ARRIVED IN
THE TEA-ROOM, SHE FELT YET MORE THE AWKWARDNESS OF HAVING NO PARTY TO
JOIN, NO ACQUAINTANCE TO CLAIM, NO GENTLEMAN TO ASSIST THEM. THEY SAW
NOTHING OF MR. ALLEN; AND AFTER LOOKING ABOUT THEM IN VAIN FOR A MORE
ELIGIBLE SITUATION, WERE OBLIGED TO SIT DOWN AT THE END OF A TABLE, AT
WHICH A LARGE PARTY WERE ALREADY PLACED, WITHOUT HAVING ANYTHING TO DO
THERE, OR ANYBODY TO SPEAK TO, EXCEPT EACH OTHER.

MRS. ALLEN CONGRATULATED HERSELF, AS SOON AS THEY WERE SEATED, ON HAVING
PRESERVED HER GOWN FROM INJURY. "IT WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY SHOCKING TO
HAVE IT TORN," SAID SHE, "WOULD NOT IT? IT IS SUCH A DELICATE MUSLIN.
FOR MY PART I HAVE NOT SEEN ANYTHING I LIKE SO WELL IN THE WHOLE ROOM, I
ASSURE YOU."

"HOW UNCOMFORTABLE IT IS," WHISPERED CATHERINE, "NOT TO HAVE A SINGLE
ACQUAINTANCE HERE!"

"YES, MY DEAR," REPLIED MRS. ALLEN, WITH PERFECT SERENITY, "IT IS VERY
UNCOMFORTABLE INDEED."

"WHAT SHALL WE DO? THE GENTLEMEN AND LADIES AT THIS TABLE LOOK AS IF
THEY WONDERED WHY WE CAME HERE--WE SEEM FORCING OURSELVES INTO THEIR
PARTY."

"AYE, SO WE DO. THAT IS VERY DISAGREEABLE. I WISH WE HAD A LARGE
ACQUAINTANCE HERE."

"I WISH WE HAD ANY--IT WOULD BE SOMEBODY TO GO TO."

"VERY TRUE, MY DEAR; AND IF WE KNEW ANYBODY WE WOULD JOIN THEM DIRECTLY.
THE SKINNERS WERE HERE LAST YEAR--I WISH THEY WERE HERE NOW."

"HAD NOT WE BETTER GO AWAY AS IT IS? HERE ARE NO TEA-THINGS FOR US, YOU
SEE."

"NO MORE THERE ARE, INDEED. HOW VERY PROVOKING! BUT I THINK WE HAD
BETTER SIT STILL, FOR ONE GETS SO TUMBLED IN SUCH A CROWD! HOW IS MY
HEAD, MY DEAR? SOMEBODY GAVE ME A PUSH THAT HAS HURT IT, I AM AFRAID."

"NO, INDEED, IT LOOKS VERY NICE. BUT, DEAR MRS. ALLEN, ARE YOU SURE
THERE IS NOBODY YOU KNOW IN ALL THIS MULTITUDE OF PEOPLE? I THINK YOU
MUST KNOW SOMEBODY."

"I DON'T, UPON MY WORD--I WISH I DID. I WISH I HAD A LARGE ACQUAINTANCE
HERE WITH ALL MY HEART, AND THEN I SHOULD GET YOU A PARTNER. I SHOULD BE
SO GLAD TO HAVE YOU DANCE. THERE GOES A STRANGE-LOOKING WOMAN! WHAT AN
ODD GOWN SHE HAS GOT ON! HOW OLD-FASHIONED IT IS! LOOK AT THE BACK."

AFTER SOME TIME THEY RECEIVED AN OFFER OF TEA FROM ONE OF THEIR
NEIGHBOURS; IT WAS THANKFULLY ACCEPTED, AND THIS INTRODUCED A LIGHT
CONVERSATION WITH THE GENTLEMAN WHO OFFERED IT, WHICH WAS THE ONLY TIME
THAT ANYBODY SPOKE TO THEM DURING THE EVENING, TILL THEY WERE DISCOVERED
AND JOINED BY MR. ALLEN WHEN THE DANCE WAS OVER.

"WELL, MISS MORLAND," SAID HE, DIRECTLY, "I HOPE YOU HAVE HAD AN
AGREEABLE BALL."

"VERY AGREEABLE INDEED," SHE REPLIED, VAINLY ENDEAVOURING TO HIDE A
GREAT YAWN.

"I WISH SHE HAD BEEN ABLE TO DANCE," SAID HIS WIFE; "I WISH WE COULD
HAVE GOT A PARTNER FOR HER. I HAVE BEEN SAYING HOW GLAD I SHOULD BE IF
THE SKINNERS WERE HERE THIS WINTER INSTEAD OF LAST; OR IF THE PARRYS HAD
COME, AS THEY TALKED OF ONCE, SHE MIGHT HAVE DANCED WITH GEORGE PARRY. I
AM SO SORRY SHE HAS NOT HAD A PARTNER!"

"WE SHALL DO BETTER ANOTHER EVENING I HOPE," WAS MR. ALLEN'S
CONSOLATION.

THE COMPANY BEGAN TO DISPERSE WHEN THE DANCING WAS OVER--ENOUGH TO LEAVE
SPACE FOR THE REMAINDER TO WALK ABOUT IN SOME COMFORT; AND NOW WAS THE
TIME FOR A HEROINE, WHO HAD NOT YET PLAYED A VERY DISTINGUISHED PART
IN THE EVENTS OF THE EVENING, TO BE NOTICED AND ADMIRED. EVERY FIVE
MINUTES, BY REMOVING SOME OF THE CROWD, GAVE GREATER OPENINGS FOR HER
CHARMS. SHE WAS NOW SEEN BY MANY YOUNG MEN WHO HAD NOT BEEN NEAR HER
BEFORE. NOT ONE, HOWEVER, STARTED WITH RAPTUROUS WONDER ON BEHOLDING
HER, NO WHISPER OF EAGER INQUIRY RAN ROUND THE ROOM, NOR WAS SHE ONCE
CALLED A DIVINITY BY ANYBODY. YET CATHERINE WAS IN VERY GOOD LOOKS, AND
HAD THE COMPANY ONLY SEEN HER THREE YEARS BEFORE, THEY WOULD NOW HAVE
THOUGHT HER EXCEEDINGLY HANDSOME.

SHE WAS LOOKED AT, HOWEVER, AND WITH SOME ADMIRATION; FOR, IN HER OWN
HEARING, TWO GENTLEMEN PRONOUNCED HER TO BE A PRETTY GIRL. SUCH WORDS
HAD THEIR DUE EFFECT; SHE IMMEDIATELY THOUGHT THE EVENING PLEASANTER
THAN SHE HAD FOUND IT BEFORE--HER HUMBLE VANITY WAS CONTENTED--SHE
FELT MORE OBLIGED TO THE TWO YOUNG MEN FOR THIS SIMPLE PRAISE THAN A
TRUE-QUALITY HEROINE WOULD HAVE BEEN FOR FIFTEEN SONNETS IN CELEBRATION
OF HER CHARMS, AND WENT TO HER CHAIR IN GOOD HUMOUR WITH EVERYBODY, AND
PERFECTLY SATISFIED WITH HER SHARE OF PUBLIC ATTENTION.




CHAPTER 3


EVERY MORNING NOW BROUGHT ITS REGULAR DUTIES--SHOPS WERE TO BE VISITED;
SOME NEW PART OF THE TOWN TO BE LOOKED AT; AND THE PUMP-ROOM TO BE
ATTENDED, WHERE THEY PARADED UP AND DOWN FOR AN HOUR, LOOKING AT
EVERYBODY AND SPEAKING TO NO ONE. THE WISH OF A NUMEROUS ACQUAINTANCE
IN BATH WAS STILL UPPERMOST WITH MRS. ALLEN, AND SHE REPEATED IT AFTER
EVERY FRESH PROOF, WHICH EVERY MORNING BROUGHT, OF HER KNOWING NOBODY AT
ALL.

THEY MADE THEIR APPEARANCE IN THE LOWER ROOMS; AND HERE FORTUNE WAS MORE
FAVOURABLE TO OUR HEROINE. THE MASTER OF THE CEREMONIES INTRODUCED TO
HER A VERY GENTLEMANLIKE YOUNG MAN AS A PARTNER; HIS NAME WAS TILNEY.
HE SEEMED TO BE ABOUT FOUR OR FIVE AND TWENTY, WAS RATHER TALL, HAD A
PLEASING COUNTENANCE, A VERY INTELLIGENT AND LIVELY EYE, AND, IF NOT
QUITE HANDSOME, WAS VERY NEAR IT. HIS ADDRESS WAS GOOD, AND CATHERINE
FELT HERSELF IN HIGH LUCK. THERE WAS LITTLE LEISURE FOR SPEAKING
WHILE THEY DANCED; BUT WHEN THEY WERE SEATED AT TEA, SHE FOUND HIM AS
AGREEABLE AS SHE HAD ALREADY GIVEN HIM CREDIT FOR BEING. HE TALKED WITH
FLUENCY AND SPIRIT--AND THERE WAS AN ARCHNESS AND PLEASANTRY IN HIS
MANNER WHICH INTERESTED, THOUGH IT WAS HARDLY UNDERSTOOD BY HER. AFTER
CHATTING SOME TIME ON SUCH MATTERS AS NATURALLY AROSE FROM THE OBJECTS
AROUND THEM, HE SUDDENLY ADDRESSED HER WITH--"I HAVE HITHERTO BEEN VERY
REMISS, MADAM, IN THE PROPER ATTENTIONS OF A PARTNER HERE; I HAVE NOT
YET ASKED YOU HOW LONG YOU HAVE BEEN IN BATH; WHETHER YOU WERE EVER HERE
BEFORE; WHETHER YOU HAVE BEEN AT THE UPPER ROOMS, THE THEATRE, AND
THE CONCERT; AND HOW YOU LIKE THE PLACE ALTOGETHER. I HAVE BEEN
VERY NEGLIGENT--BUT ARE YOU NOW AT LEISURE TO SATISFY ME IN THESE
PARTICULARS? IF YOU ARE I WILL BEGIN DIRECTLY."

"YOU NEED NOT GIVE YOURSELF THAT TROUBLE, SIR."

"NO TROUBLE, I ASSURE YOU, MADAM." THEN FORMING HIS FEATURES INTO A SET
SMILE, AND AFFECTEDLY SOFTENING HIS VOICE, HE ADDED, WITH A SIMPERING
AIR, "HAVE YOU BEEN LONG IN BATH, MADAM?"

"ABOUT A WEEK, SIR," REPLIED CATHERINE, TRYING NOT TO LAUGH.

"REALLY!" WITH AFFECTED ASTONISHMENT.

"WHY SHOULD YOU BE SURPRISED, SIR?"

"WHY, INDEED!" SAID HE, IN HIS NATURAL TONE. "BUT SOME EMOTION MUST
APPEAR TO BE RAISED BY YOUR REPLY, AND SURPRISE IS MORE EASILY ASSUMED,
AND NOT LESS REASONABLE THAN ANY OTHER. NOW LET US GO ON. WERE YOU NEVER
HERE BEFORE, MADAM?"

"NEVER, SIR."

"INDEED! HAVE YOU YET HONOURED THE UPPER ROOMS?"

"YES, SIR, I WAS THERE LAST MONDAY."

"HAVE YOU BEEN TO THE THEATRE?"

"YES, SIR, I WAS AT THE PLAY ON TUESDAY."

"TO THE CONCERT?"

"YES, SIR, ON WEDNESDAY."

"AND ARE YOU ALTOGETHER PLEASED WITH BATH?"

"YES--I LIKE IT VERY WELL."

"NOW I MUST GIVE ONE SMIRK, AND THEN WE MAY BE RATIONAL AGAIN."
CATHERINE TURNED AWAY HER HEAD, NOT KNOWING WHETHER SHE MIGHT VENTURE TO
LAUGH. "I SEE WHAT YOU THINK OF ME," SAID HE GRAVELY--"I SHALL MAKE BUT
A POOR FIGURE IN YOUR JOURNAL TOMORROW."

"MY JOURNAL!"

"YES, I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU WILL SAY: FRIDAY, WENT TO THE LOWER
ROOMS; WORE MY SPRIGGED MUSLIN ROBE WITH BLUE TRIMMINGS--PLAIN BLACK
SHOES--APPEARED TO MUCH ADVANTAGE; BUT WAS STRANGELY HARASSED BY A
QUEER, HALF-WITTED MAN, WHO WOULD MAKE ME DANCE WITH HIM, AND DISTRESSED
ME BY HIS NONSENSE."

"INDEED I SHALL SAY NO SUCH THING."

"SHALL I TELL YOU WHAT YOU OUGHT TO SAY?"

"IF YOU PLEASE."

"I DANCED WITH A VERY AGREEABLE YOUNG MAN, INTRODUCED BY MR. KING; HAD
A GREAT DEAL OF CONVERSATION WITH HIM--SEEMS A MOST EXTRAORDINARY
GENIUS--HOPE I MAY KNOW MORE OF HIM. THAT, MADAM, IS WHAT I WISH YOU TO
SAY."

"BUT, PERHAPS, I KEEP NO JOURNAL."

"PERHAPS YOU ARE NOT SITTING IN THIS ROOM, AND I AM NOT SITTING BY
YOU. THESE ARE POINTS IN WHICH A DOUBT IS EQUALLY POSSIBLE. NOT KEEP A
JOURNAL! HOW ARE YOUR ABSENT COUSINS TO UNDERSTAND THE TENOUR OF YOUR
LIFE IN BATH WITHOUT ONE? HOW ARE THE CIVILITIES AND COMPLIMENTS OF
EVERY DAY TO BE RELATED AS THEY OUGHT TO BE, UNLESS NOTED DOWN EVERY
EVENING IN A JOURNAL? HOW ARE YOUR VARIOUS DRESSES TO BE REMEMBERED,
AND THE PARTICULAR STATE OF YOUR COMPLEXION, AND CURL OF YOUR HAIR TO BE
DESCRIBED IN ALL THEIR DIVERSITIES, WITHOUT HAVING CONSTANT RECOURSE TO
A JOURNAL? MY DEAR MADAM, I AM NOT SO IGNORANT OF YOUNG LADIES' WAYS AS
YOU WISH TO BELIEVE ME; IT IS THIS DELIGHTFUL HABIT OF JOURNALING WHICH
LARGELY CONTRIBUTES TO FORM THE EASY STYLE OF WRITING FOR WHICH LADIES
ARE SO GENERALLY CELEBRATED. EVERYBODY ALLOWS THAT THE TALENT OF WRITING
AGREEABLE LETTERS IS PECULIARLY FEMALE. NATURE MAY HAVE DONE SOMETHING,
BUT I AM SURE IT MUST BE ESSENTIALLY ASSISTED BY THE PRACTICE OF KEEPING
A JOURNAL."

"I HAVE SOMETIMES THOUGHT," SAID CATHERINE, DOUBTINGLY, "WHETHER LADIES
DO WRITE SO MUCH BETTER LETTERS THAN GENTLEMEN! THAT IS--I SHOULD NOT
THINK THE SUPERIORITY WAS ALWAYS ON OUR SIDE."

"AS FAR AS I HAVE HAD OPPORTUNITY OF JUDGING, IT APPEARS TO ME THAT THE
USUAL STYLE OF LETTER-WRITING AMONG WOMEN IS FAULTLESS, EXCEPT IN THREE
PARTICULARS."

"AND WHAT ARE THEY?"

"A GENERAL DEFICIENCY OF SUBJECT, A TOTAL INATTENTION TO STOPS, AND A
VERY FREQUENT IGNORANCE OF GRAMMAR."

"UPON MY WORD! I NEED NOT HAVE BEEN AFRAID OF DISCLAIMING THE
COMPLIMENT. YOU DO NOT THINK TOO HIGHLY OF US IN THAT WAY."

"I SHOULD NO MORE LAY IT DOWN AS A GENERAL RULE THAT WOMEN WRITE BETTER
LETTERS THAN MEN, THAN THAT THEY SING BETTER DUETS, OR DRAW BETTER
LANDSCAPES. IN EVERY POWER, OF WHICH TASTE IS THE FOUNDATION, EXCELLENCE
IS PRETTY FAIRLY DIVIDED BETWEEN THE SEXES."

THEY WERE INTERRUPTED BY MRS. ALLEN: "MY DEAR CATHERINE," SAID SHE, "DO
TAKE THIS PIN OUT OF MY SLEEVE; I AM AFRAID IT HAS TORN A HOLE ALREADY;
I SHALL BE QUITE SORRY IF IT HAS, FOR THIS IS A FAVOURITE GOWN, THOUGH
IT COST BUT NINE SHILLINGS A YARD."

"THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT I SHOULD HAVE GUESSED IT, MADAM," SAID MR. TILNEY,
LOOKING AT THE MUSLIN.

"DO YOU UNDERSTAND MUSLINS, SIR?"

"PARTICULARLY WELL; I ALWAYS BUY MY OWN CRAVATS, AND AM ALLOWED TO BE AN
EXCELLENT JUDGE; AND MY SISTER HAS OFTEN TRUSTED ME IN THE CHOICE OF A
GOWN. I BOUGHT ONE FOR HER THE OTHER DAY, AND IT WAS PRONOUNCED TO BE A
PRODIGIOUS BARGAIN BY EVERY LADY WHO SAW IT. I GAVE BUT FIVE SHILLINGS A
YARD FOR IT, AND A TRUE INDIAN MUSLIN."

MRS. ALLEN WAS QUITE STRUCK BY HIS GENIUS. "MEN COMMONLY TAKE SO LITTLE
NOTICE OF THOSE THINGS," SAID SHE; "I CAN NEVER GET MR. ALLEN TO KNOW
ONE OF MY GOWNS FROM ANOTHER. YOU MUST BE A GREAT COMFORT TO YOUR
SISTER, SIR."

"I HOPE I AM, MADAM."

"AND PRAY, SIR, WHAT DO YOU THINK OF MISS MORLAND'S GOWN?"

"IT IS VERY PRETTY, MADAM," SAID HE, GRAVELY EXAMINING IT; "BUT I DO NOT
THINK IT WILL WASH WELL; I AM AFRAID IT WILL FRAY."

"HOW CAN YOU," SAID CATHERINE, LAUGHING, "BE SO--" SHE HAD ALMOST SAID
"STRANGE."

"I AM QUITE OF YOUR OPINION, SIR," REPLIED MRS. ALLEN; "AND SO I TOLD
MISS MORLAND WHEN SHE BOUGHT IT."

"BUT THEN YOU KNOW, MADAM, MUSLIN ALWAYS TURNS TO SOME ACCOUNT OR OTHER;
MISS MORLAND WILL GET ENOUGH OUT OF IT FOR A HANDKERCHIEF, OR A CAP, OR
A CLOAK. MUSLIN CAN NEVER BE SAID TO BE WASTED. I HAVE HEARD MY SISTER
SAY SO FORTY TIMES, WHEN SHE HAS BEEN EXTRAVAGANT IN BUYING MORE THAN
SHE WANTED, OR CARELESS IN CUTTING IT TO PIECES."

"BATH IS A CHARMING PLACE, SIR; THERE ARE SO MANY GOOD SHOPS HERE. WE
ARE SADLY OFF IN THE COUNTRY; NOT BUT WHAT WE HAVE VERY GOOD SHOPS IN
SALISBURY, BUT IT IS SO FAR TO GO--EIGHT MILES IS A LONG WAY; MR. ALLEN
SAYS IT IS NINE, MEASURED NINE; BUT I AM SURE IT CANNOT BE MORE THAN
EIGHT; AND IT IS SUCH A FAG--I COME BACK TIRED TO DEATH. NOW, HERE ONE
CAN STEP OUT OF DOORS AND GET A THING IN FIVE MINUTES."

MR. TILNEY WAS POLITE ENOUGH TO SEEM INTERESTED IN WHAT SHE SAID; AND
SHE KEPT HIM ON THE SUBJECT OF MUSLINS TILL THE DANCING RECOMMENCED.
CATHERINE FEARED, AS SHE LISTENED TO THEIR DISCOURSE, THAT HE INDULGED
HIMSELF A LITTLE TOO MUCH WITH THE FOIBLES OF OTHERS. "WHAT ARE YOU
THINKING OF SO EARNESTLY?" SAID HE, AS THEY WALKED BACK TO THE BALLROOM;
"NOT OF YOUR PARTNER, I HOPE, FOR, BY THAT SHAKE OF THE HEAD, YOUR
MEDITATIONS ARE NOT SATISFACTORY."

CATHERINE COLOURED, AND SAID, "I WAS NOT THINKING OF ANYTHING."

"THAT IS ARTFUL AND DEEP, TO BE SURE; BUT I HAD RATHER BE TOLD AT ONCE
THAT YOU WILL NOT TELL ME."

"WELL THEN, I WILL NOT."

"THANK YOU; FOR NOW WE SHALL SOON BE ACQUAINTED, AS I AM AUTHORIZED TO
TEASE YOU ON THIS SUBJECT WHENEVER WE MEET, AND NOTHING IN THE WORLD
ADVANCES INTIMACY SO MUCH."

THEY DANCED AGAIN; AND, WHEN THE ASSEMBLY CLOSED, PARTED, ON THE
LADY'S SIDE AT LEAST, WITH A STRONG INCLINATION FOR CONTINUING THE
ACQUAINTANCE. WHETHER SHE THOUGHT OF HIM SO MUCH, WHILE SHE DRANK HER
WARM WINE AND WATER, AND PREPARED HERSELF FOR BED, AS TO DREAM OF HIM
WHEN THERE, CANNOT BE ASCERTAINED; BUT I HOPE IT WAS NO MORE THAN IN
A SLIGHT SLUMBER, OR A MORNING DOZE AT MOST; FOR IF IT BE TRUE, AS A
CELEBRATED WRITER HAS MAINTAINED, THAT NO YOUNG LADY CAN BE JUSTIFIED
IN FALLING IN LOVE BEFORE THE GENTLEMAN'S LOVE IS DECLARED, IT MUST BE
VERY IMPROPER THAT A YOUNG LADY SHOULD DREAM OF A GENTLEMAN BEFORE THE
GENTLEMAN IS FIRST KNOWN TO HAVE DREAMT OF HER. HOW PROPER MR. TILNEY
MIGHT BE AS A DREAMER OR A LOVER HAD NOT YET PERHAPS ENTERED MR. ALLEN'S
HEAD, BUT THAT HE WAS NOT OBJECTIONABLE AS A COMMON ACQUAINTANCE FOR
HIS YOUNG CHARGE HE WAS ON INQUIRY SATISFIED; FOR HE HAD EARLY IN THE
EVENING TAKEN PAINS TO KNOW WHO HER PARTNER WAS, AND HAD BEEN ASSURED
OF MR. TILNEY'S BEING A CLERGYMAN, AND OF A VERY RESPECTABLE FAMILY IN
GLOUCESTERSHIRE.




CHAPTER 4


WITH MORE THAN USUAL EAGERNESS DID CATHERINE HASTEN TO THE PUMP-ROOM THE
NEXT DAY, SECURE WITHIN HERSELF OF SEEING MR. TILNEY THERE BEFORE THE
MORNING WERE OVER, AND READY TO MEET HIM WITH A SMILE; BUT NO SMILE
WAS DEMANDED--MR. TILNEY DID NOT APPEAR. EVERY CREATURE IN BATH,
EXCEPT HIMSELF, WAS TO BE SEEN IN THE ROOM AT DIFFERENT PERIODS OF THE
FASHIONABLE HOURS; CROWDS OF PEOPLE WERE EVERY MOMENT PASSING IN AND
OUT, UP THE STEPS AND DOWN; PEOPLE WHOM NOBODY CARED ABOUT, AND NOBODY
WANTED TO SEE; AND HE ONLY WAS ABSENT. "WHAT A DELIGHTFUL PLACE BATH
IS," SAID MRS. ALLEN AS THEY SAT DOWN NEAR THE GREAT CLOCK, AFTER
PARADING THE ROOM TILL THEY WERE TIRED; "AND HOW PLEASANT IT WOULD BE IF
WE HAD ANY ACQUAINTANCE HERE."

THIS SENTIMENT HAD BEEN UTTERED SO OFTEN IN VAIN THAT MRS. ALLEN HAD NO
PARTICULAR REASON TO HOPE IT WOULD BE FOLLOWED WITH MORE ADVANTAGE NOW;
BUT WE ARE TOLD TO "DESPAIR OF NOTHING WE WOULD ATTAIN," AS "UNWEARIED
DILIGENCE OUR POINT WOULD GAIN"; AND THE UNWEARIED DILIGENCE WITH WHICH
SHE HAD EVERY DAY WISHED FOR THE SAME THING WAS AT LENGTH TO HAVE ITS
JUST REWARD, FOR HARDLY HAD SHE BEEN SEATED TEN MINUTES BEFORE A LADY OF
ABOUT HER OWN AGE, WHO WAS SITTING BY HER, AND HAD BEEN LOOKING AT HER
ATTENTIVELY FOR SEVERAL MINUTES, ADDRESSED HER WITH GREAT COMPLAISANCE
IN THESE WORDS: "I THINK, MADAM, I CANNOT BE MISTAKEN; IT IS A LONG TIME
SINCE I HAD THE PLEASURE OF SEEING YOU, BUT IS NOT YOUR NAME ALLEN?"
THIS QUESTION ANSWERED, AS IT READILY WAS, THE STRANGER PRONOUNCED HERS
TO BE THORPE; AND MRS. ALLEN IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED THE FEATURES OF
A FORMER SCHOOLFELLOW AND INTIMATE, WHOM SHE HAD SEEN ONLY ONCE SINCE
THEIR RESPECTIVE MARRIAGES, AND THAT MANY YEARS AGO. THEIR JOY ON THIS
MEETING WAS VERY GREAT, AS WELL IT MIGHT, SINCE THEY HAD BEEN CONTENTED
TO KNOW NOTHING OF EACH OTHER FOR THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS. COMPLIMENTS
ON GOOD LOOKS NOW PASSED; AND, AFTER OBSERVING HOW TIME HAD SLIPPED AWAY
SINCE THEY WERE LAST TOGETHER, HOW LITTLE THEY HAD THOUGHT OF MEETING IN
BATH, AND WHAT A PLEASURE IT WAS TO SEE AN OLD FRIEND, THEY PROCEEDED TO
MAKE INQUIRIES AND GIVE INTELLIGENCE AS TO THEIR FAMILIES, SISTERS, AND
COUSINS, TALKING BOTH TOGETHER, FAR MORE READY TO GIVE THAN TO RECEIVE
INFORMATION, AND EACH HEARING VERY LITTLE OF WHAT THE OTHER SAID. MRS.
THORPE, HOWEVER, HAD ONE GREAT ADVANTAGE AS A TALKER, OVER MRS. ALLEN,
IN A FAMILY OF CHILDREN; AND WHEN SHE EXPATIATED ON THE TALENTS OF HER
SONS, AND THE BEAUTY OF HER DAUGHTERS, WHEN SHE RELATED THEIR DIFFERENT
SITUATIONS AND VIEWS--THAT JOHN WAS AT OXFORD, EDWARD AT MERCHANT
TAYLORS', AND WILLIAM AT SEA--AND ALL OF THEM MORE BELOVED AND RESPECTED
IN THEIR DIFFERENT STATION THAN ANY OTHER THREE BEINGS EVER WERE, MRS.
ALLEN HAD NO SIMILAR INFORMATION TO GIVE, NO SIMILAR TRIUMPHS TO PRESS
ON THE UNWILLING AND UNBELIEVING EAR OF HER FRIEND, AND WAS FORCED TO
SIT AND APPEAR TO LISTEN TO ALL THESE MATERNAL EFFUSIONS, CONSOLING
HERSELF, HOWEVER, WITH THE DISCOVERY, WHICH HER KEEN EYE SOON MADE, THAT
THE LACE ON MRS. THORPE'S PELISSE WAS NOT HALF SO HANDSOME AS THAT ON
HER OWN.

"HERE COME MY DEAR GIRLS," CRIED MRS. THORPE, POINTING AT THREE
SMART-LOOKING FEMALES WHO, ARM IN ARM, WERE THEN MOVING TOWARDS HER. "MY
DEAR MRS. ALLEN, I LONG TO INTRODUCE THEM; THEY WILL BE SO DELIGHTED
TO SEE YOU: THE TALLEST IS ISABELLA, MY ELDEST; IS NOT SHE A FINE YOUNG
WOMAN? THE OTHERS ARE VERY MUCH ADMIRED TOO, BUT I BELIEVE ISABELLA IS
THE HANDSOMEST."

THE MISS THORPES WERE INTRODUCED; AND MISS MORLAND, WHO HAD BEEN FOR A
SHORT TIME FORGOTTEN, WAS INTRODUCED LIKEWISE. THE NAME SEEMED TO STRIKE
THEM ALL; AND, AFTER SPEAKING TO HER WITH GREAT CIVILITY, THE ELDEST
YOUNG LADY OBSERVED ALOUD TO THE REST, "HOW EXCESSIVELY LIKE HER BROTHER
MISS MORLAND IS!"

"THE VERY PICTURE OF HIM INDEED!" CRIED THE MOTHER--AND "I SHOULD HAVE
KNOWN HER ANYWHERE FOR HIS SISTER!" WAS REPEATED BY THEM ALL, TWO OR
THREE TIMES OVER. FOR A MOMENT CATHERINE WAS SURPRISED; BUT MRS. THORPE
AND HER DAUGHTERS HAD SCARCELY BEGUN THE HISTORY OF THEIR ACQUAINTANCE
WITH MR. JAMES MORLAND, BEFORE SHE REMEMBERED THAT HER ELDEST BROTHER
HAD LATELY FORMED AN INTIMACY WITH A YOUNG MAN OF HIS OWN COLLEGE, OF
THE NAME OF THORPE; AND THAT HE HAD SPENT THE LAST WEEK OF THE CHRISTMAS
VACATION WITH HIS FAMILY, NEAR LONDON.

THE WHOLE BEING EXPLAINED, MANY OBLIGING THINGS WERE SAID BY THE MISS
THORPES OF THEIR WISH OF BEING BETTER ACQUAINTED WITH HER; OF BEING
CONSIDERED AS ALREADY FRIENDS, THROUGH THE FRIENDSHIP OF THEIR BROTHERS,
ETC., WHICH CATHERINE HEARD WITH PLEASURE, AND ANSWERED WITH ALL THE
PRETTY EXPRESSIONS SHE COULD COMMAND; AND, AS THE FIRST PROOF OF AMITY,
SHE WAS SOON INVITED TO ACCEPT AN ARM OF THE ELDEST MISS THORPE, AND
TAKE A TURN WITH HER ABOUT THE ROOM. CATHERINE WAS DELIGHTED WITH THIS
EXTENSION OF HER BATH ACQUAINTANCE, AND ALMOST FORGOT MR. TILNEY WHILE
SHE TALKED TO MISS THORPE. FRIENDSHIP IS CERTAINLY THE FINEST BALM FOR
THE PANGS OF DISAPPOINTED LOVE.

THEIR CONVERSATION TURNED UPON THOSE SUBJECTS, OF WHICH THE FREE
DISCUSSION HAS GENERALLY MUCH TO DO IN PERFECTING A SUDDEN INTIMACY
BETWEEN TWO YOUNG LADIES: SUCH AS DRESS, BALLS, FLIRTATIONS, AND
QUIZZES. MISS THORPE, HOWEVER, BEING FOUR YEARS OLDER THAN MISS MORLAND,
AND AT LEAST FOUR YEARS BETTER INFORMED, HAD A VERY DECIDED ADVANTAGE IN
DISCUSSING SUCH POINTS; SHE COULD COMPARE THE BALLS OF BATH WITH THOSE
OF TUNBRIDGE, ITS FASHIONS WITH THE FASHIONS OF LONDON; COULD RECTIFY
THE OPINIONS OF HER NEW FRIEND IN MANY ARTICLES OF TASTEFUL ATTIRE;
COULD DISCOVER A FLIRTATION BETWEEN ANY GENTLEMAN AND LADY WHO ONLY
SMILED ON EACH OTHER; AND POINT OUT A QUIZ THROUGH THE THICKNESS OF A
CROWD. THESE POWERS RECEIVED DUE ADMIRATION FROM CATHERINE, TO WHOM THEY
WERE ENTIRELY NEW; AND THE RESPECT WHICH THEY NATURALLY INSPIRED MIGHT
HAVE BEEN TOO GREAT FOR FAMILIARITY, HAD NOT THE EASY GAIETY OF MISS
THORPE'S MANNERS, AND HER FREQUENT EXPRESSIONS OF DELIGHT ON THIS
ACQUAINTANCE WITH HER, SOFTENED DOWN EVERY FEELING OF AWE, AND LEFT
NOTHING BUT TENDER AFFECTION. THEIR INCREASING ATTACHMENT WAS NOT TO BE
SATISFIED WITH HALF A DOZEN TURNS IN THE PUMP-ROOM, BUT REQUIRED, WHEN
THEY ALL QUITTED IT TOGETHER, THAT MISS THORPE SHOULD ACCOMPANY MISS
MORLAND TO THE VERY DOOR OF MR. ALLEN'S HOUSE; AND THAT THEY SHOULD
THERE PART WITH A MOST AFFECTIONATE AND LENGTHENED SHAKE OF HANDS, AFTER
LEARNING, TO THEIR MUTUAL RELIEF, THAT THEY SHOULD SEE EACH OTHER ACROSS
THE THEATRE AT NIGHT, AND SAY THEIR PRAYERS IN THE SAME CHAPEL THE NEXT
MORNING. CATHERINE THEN RAN DIRECTLY UPSTAIRS, AND WATCHED MISS THORPE'S
PROGRESS DOWN THE STREET FROM THE DRAWING-ROOM WINDOW; ADMIRED THE
GRACEFUL SPIRIT OF HER WALK, THE FASHIONABLE AIR OF HER FIGURE AND
DRESS; AND FELT GRATEFUL, AS WELL SHE MIGHT, FOR THE CHANCE WHICH HAD
PROCURED HER SUCH A FRIEND.

MRS. THORPE WAS A WIDOW, AND NOT A VERY RICH ONE; SHE WAS A
GOOD-HUMOURED, WELL-MEANING WOMAN, AND A VERY INDULGENT MOTHER. HER
ELDEST DAUGHTER HAD GREAT PERSONAL BEAUTY, AND THE YOUNGER ONES, BY
PRETENDING TO BE AS HANDSOME AS THEIR SISTER, IMITATING HER AIR, AND
DRESSING IN THE SAME STYLE, DID VERY WELL.

THIS BRIEF ACCOUNT OF THE FAMILY IS INTENDED TO SUPERSEDE THE NECESSITY
OF A LONG AND MINUTE DETAIL FROM MRS. THORPE HERSELF, OF HER PAST
ADVENTURES AND SUFFERINGS, WHICH MIGHT OTHERWISE BE EXPECTED TO OCCUPY
THE THREE OR FOUR FOLLOWING CHAPTERS; IN WHICH THE WORTHLESSNESS OF
LORDS AND ATTORNEYS MIGHT BE SET FORTH, AND CONVERSATIONS, WHICH HAD
PASSED TWENTY YEARS BEFORE, BE MINUTELY REPEATED.




CHAPTER 5


CATHERINE WAS NOT SO MUCH ENGAGED AT THE THEATRE THAT EVENING, IN
RETURNING THE NODS AND SMILES OF MISS THORPE, THOUGH THEY CERTAINLY
CLAIMED MUCH OF HER LEISURE, AS TO FORGET TO LOOK WITH AN INQUIRING EYE
FOR MR. TILNEY IN EVERY BOX WHICH HER EYE COULD REACH; BUT SHE LOOKED IN
VAIN. MR. TILNEY WAS NO FONDER OF THE PLAY THAN THE PUMP-ROOM. SHE HOPED
TO BE MORE FORTUNATE THE NEXT DAY; AND WHEN HER WISHES FOR FINE WEATHER
WERE ANSWERED BY SEEING A BEAUTIFUL MORNING, SHE HARDLY FELT A DOUBT OF
IT; FOR A FINE SUNDAY IN BATH EMPTIES EVERY HOUSE OF ITS INHABITANTS,
AND ALL THE WORLD APPEARS ON SUCH AN OCCASION TO WALK ABOUT AND TELL
THEIR ACQUAINTANCE WHAT A CHARMING DAY IT IS.

AS SOON AS DIVINE SERVICE WAS OVER, THE THORPES AND ALLENS EAGERLY
JOINED EACH OTHER; AND AFTER STAYING LONG ENOUGH IN THE PUMP-ROOM TO
DISCOVER THAT THE CROWD WAS INSUPPORTABLE, AND THAT THERE WAS NOT
A GENTEEL FACE TO BE SEEN, WHICH EVERYBODY DISCOVERS EVERY SUNDAY
THROUGHOUT THE SEASON, THEY HASTENED AWAY TO THE CRESCENT, TO BREATHE
THE FRESH AIR OF BETTER COMPANY. HERE CATHERINE AND ISABELLA, ARM
IN ARM, AGAIN TASTED THE SWEETS OF FRIENDSHIP IN AN UNRESERVED
CONVERSATION; THEY TALKED MUCH, AND WITH MUCH ENJOYMENT; BUT AGAIN
WAS CATHERINE DISAPPOINTED IN HER HOPE OF RESEEING HER PARTNER. HE WAS
NOWHERE TO BE MET WITH; EVERY SEARCH FOR HIM WAS EQUALLY UNSUCCESSFUL,
IN MORNING LOUNGES OR EVENING ASSEMBLIES; NEITHER AT THE UPPER NOR LOWER
ROOMS, AT DRESSED OR UNDRESSED BALLS, WAS HE PERCEIVABLE; NOR AMONG THE
WALKERS, THE HORSEMEN, OR THE CURRICLE-DRIVERS OF THE MORNING. HIS NAME
WAS NOT IN THE PUMP-ROOM BOOK, AND CURIOSITY COULD DO NO MORE. HE MUST
BE GONE FROM BATH. YET HE HAD NOT MENTIONED THAT HIS STAY WOULD BE SO
SHORT! THIS SORT OF MYSTERIOUSNESS, WHICH IS ALWAYS SO BECOMING IN A
HERO, THREW A FRESH GRACE IN CATHERINE'S IMAGINATION AROUND HIS PERSON
AND MANNERS, AND INCREASED HER ANXIETY TO KNOW MORE OF HIM. FROM THE
THORPES SHE COULD LEARN NOTHING, FOR THEY HAD BEEN ONLY TWO DAYS IN BATH
BEFORE THEY MET WITH MRS. ALLEN. IT WAS A SUBJECT, HOWEVER, IN WHICH
SHE OFTEN INDULGED WITH HER FAIR FRIEND, FROM WHOM SHE RECEIVED EVERY
POSSIBLE ENCOURAGEMENT TO CONTINUE TO THINK OF HIM; AND HIS IMPRESSION
ON HER FANCY WAS NOT SUFFERED THEREFORE TO WEAKEN. ISABELLA WAS VERY
SURE THAT HE MUST BE A CHARMING YOUNG MAN, AND WAS EQUALLY SURE THAT HE
MUST HAVE BEEN DELIGHTED WITH HER DEAR CATHERINE, AND WOULD THEREFORE
SHORTLY RETURN. SHE LIKED HIM THE BETTER FOR BEING A CLERGYMAN, "FOR SHE
MUST CONFESS HERSELF VERY PARTIAL TO THE PROFESSION"; AND SOMETHING LIKE
A SIGH ESCAPED HER AS SHE SAID IT. PERHAPS CATHERINE WAS WRONG IN NOT
DEMANDING THE CAUSE OF THAT GENTLE EMOTION--BUT SHE WAS NOT EXPERIENCED
ENOUGH IN THE FINESSE OF LOVE, OR THE DUTIES OF FRIENDSHIP, TO KNOW WHEN
DELICATE RAILLERY WAS PROPERLY CALLED FOR, OR WHEN A CONFIDENCE SHOULD
BE FORCED.

MRS. ALLEN WAS NOW QUITE HAPPY--QUITE SATISFIED WITH BATH. SHE HAD FOUND
SOME ACQUAINTANCE, HAD BEEN SO LUCKY TOO AS TO FIND IN THEM THE FAMILY
OF A MOST WORTHY OLD FRIEND; AND, AS THE COMPLETION OF GOOD FORTUNE, HAD
FOUND THESE FRIENDS BY NO MEANS SO EXPENSIVELY DRESSED AS HERSELF. HER
DAILY EXPRESSIONS WERE NO LONGER, "I WISH WE HAD SOME ACQUAINTANCE IN
BATH!" THEY WERE CHANGED INTO, "HOW GLAD I AM WE HAVE MET WITH MRS.
THORPE!" AND SHE WAS AS EAGER IN PROMOTING THE INTERCOURSE OF THE TWO
FAMILIES, AS HER YOUNG CHARGE AND ISABELLA THEMSELVES COULD BE; NEVER
SATISFIED WITH THE DAY UNLESS SHE SPENT THE CHIEF OF IT BY THE SIDE OF
MRS. THORPE, IN WHAT THEY CALLED CONVERSATION, BUT IN WHICH THERE WAS
SCARCELY EVER ANY EXCHANGE OF OPINION, AND NOT OFTEN ANY RESEMBLANCE OF
SUBJECT, FOR MRS. THORPE TALKED CHIEFLY OF HER CHILDREN, AND MRS. ALLEN
OF HER GOWNS.

THE PROGRESS OF THE FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN CATHERINE AND ISABELLA WAS QUICK
AS ITS BEGINNING HAD BEEN WARM, AND THEY PASSED SO RAPIDLY THROUGH EVERY
GRADATION OF INCREASING TENDERNESS THAT THERE WAS SHORTLY NO FRESH PROOF
OF IT TO BE GIVEN TO THEIR FRIENDS OR THEMSELVES. THEY CALLED EACH OTHER
BY THEIR CHRISTIAN NAME, WERE ALWAYS ARM IN ARM WHEN THEY WALKED, PINNED
UP EACH OTHER'S TRAIN FOR THE DANCE, AND WERE NOT TO BE DIVIDED IN THE
SET; AND IF A RAINY MORNING DEPRIVED THEM OF OTHER ENJOYMENTS, THEY
WERE STILL RESOLUTE IN MEETING IN DEFIANCE OF WET AND DIRT, AND SHUT
THEMSELVES UP, TO READ NOVELS TOGETHER. YES, NOVELS; FOR I WILL NOT
ADOPT THAT UNGENEROUS AND IMPOLITIC CUSTOM SO COMMON WITH NOVEL-WRITERS,
OF DEGRADING BY THEIR CONTEMPTUOUS CENSURE THE VERY PERFORMANCES, TO THE
NUMBER OF WHICH THEY ARE THEMSELVES ADDING--JOINING WITH THEIR GREATEST
ENEMIES IN BESTOWING THE HARSHEST EPITHETS ON SUCH WORKS, AND SCARCELY
EVER PERMITTING THEM TO BE READ BY THEIR OWN HEROINE, WHO, IF SHE
ACCIDENTALLY TAKE UP A NOVEL, IS SURE TO TURN OVER ITS INSIPID PAGES
WITH DISGUST. ALAS! IF THE HEROINE OF ONE NOVEL BE NOT PATRONIZED BY THE
HEROINE OF ANOTHER, FROM WHOM CAN SHE EXPECT PROTECTION AND REGARD? I
CANNOT APPROVE OF IT. LET US LEAVE IT TO THE REVIEWERS TO ABUSE SUCH
EFFUSIONS OF FANCY AT THEIR LEISURE, AND OVER EVERY NEW NOVEL TO TALK IN
THREADBARE STRAINS OF THE TRASH WITH WHICH THE PRESS NOW GROANS. LET US
NOT DESERT ONE ANOTHER; WE ARE AN INJURED BODY. ALTHOUGH OUR PRODUCTIONS
HAVE AFFORDED MORE EXTENSIVE AND UNAFFECTED PLEASURE THAN THOSE OF ANY
OTHER LITERARY CORPORATION IN THE WORLD, NO SPECIES OF COMPOSITION HAS
BEEN SO MUCH DECRIED. FROM PRIDE, IGNORANCE, OR FASHION, OUR FOES
ARE ALMOST AS MANY AS OUR READERS. AND WHILE THE ABILITIES OF THE
NINE-HUNDREDTH ABRIDGER OF THE HISTORY OF ENGLAND, OR OF THE MAN WHO
COLLECTS AND PUBLISHES IN A VOLUME SOME DOZEN LINES OF MILTON, POPE, AND
PRIOR, WITH A PAPER FROM THE SPECTATOR, AND A CHAPTER FROM STERNE,
ARE EULOGIZED BY A THOUSAND PENS--THERE SEEMS ALMOST A GENERAL WISH OF
DECRYING THE CAPACITY AND UNDERVALUING THE LABOUR OF THE NOVELIST, AND
OF SLIGHTING THE PERFORMANCES WHICH HAVE ONLY GENIUS, WIT, AND TASTE TO
RECOMMEND THEM. "I AM NO NOVEL-READER--I SELDOM LOOK INTO NOVELS--DO NOT
IMAGINE THAT I OFTEN READ NOVELS--IT IS REALLY VERY WELL FOR A NOVEL."
SUCH IS THE COMMON CANT. "AND WHAT ARE YOU READING, MISS--?" "OH! IT IS
ONLY A NOVEL!" REPLIES THE YOUNG LADY, WHILE SHE LAYS DOWN HER BOOK
WITH AFFECTED INDIFFERENCE, OR MOMENTARY SHAME. "IT IS ONLY CECILIA, OR
CAMILLA, OR BELINDA"; OR, IN SHORT, ONLY SOME WORK IN WHICH THE GREATEST
POWERS OF THE MIND ARE DISPLAYED, IN WHICH THE MOST THOROUGH KNOWLEDGE
OF HUMAN NATURE, THE HAPPIEST DELINEATION OF ITS VARIETIES, THE
LIVELIEST EFFUSIONS OF WIT AND HUMOUR, ARE CONVEYED TO THE WORLD IN THE
BEST-CHOSEN LANGUAGE. NOW, HAD THE SAME YOUNG LADY BEEN ENGAGED WITH A
VOLUME OF THE SPECTATOR, INSTEAD OF SUCH A WORK, HOW PROUDLY WOULD SHE
HAVE PRODUCED THE BOOK, AND TOLD ITS NAME; THOUGH THE CHANCES MUST BE
AGAINST HER BEING OCCUPIED BY ANY PART OF THAT VOLUMINOUS PUBLICATION,
OF WHICH EITHER THE MATTER OR MANNER WOULD NOT DISGUST A YOUNG PERSON OF
TASTE: THE SUBSTANCE OF ITS PAPERS SO OFTEN CONSISTING IN THE STATEMENT
OF IMPROBABLE CIRCUMSTANCES, UNNATURAL CHARACTERS, AND TOPICS OF
CONVERSATION WHICH NO LONGER CONCERN ANYONE LIVING; AND THEIR LANGUAGE,
TOO, FREQUENTLY SO COARSE AS TO GIVE NO VERY FAVOURABLE IDEA OF THE AGE
THAT COULD ENDURE IT.




CHAPTER 6


THE FOLLOWING CONVERSATION, WHICH TOOK PLACE BETWEEN THE TWO FRIENDS IN
THE PUMP-ROOM ONE MORNING, AFTER AN ACQUAINTANCE OF EIGHT OR NINE
DAYS, IS GIVEN AS A SPECIMEN OF THEIR VERY WARM ATTACHMENT, AND OF THE
DELICACY, DISCRETION, ORIGINALITY OF THOUGHT, AND LITERARY TASTE WHICH
MARKED THE REASONABLENESS OF THAT ATTACHMENT.

THEY MET BY APPOINTMENT; AND AS ISABELLA HAD ARRIVED NEARLY FIVE
MINUTES BEFORE HER FRIEND, HER FIRST ADDRESS NATURALLY WAS, "MY DEAREST
CREATURE, WHAT CAN HAVE MADE YOU SO LATE? I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU AT
LEAST THIS AGE!"

"HAVE YOU, INDEED! I AM VERY SORRY FOR IT; BUT REALLY I THOUGHT I WAS IN
VERY GOOD TIME. IT IS BUT JUST ONE. I HOPE YOU HAVE NOT BEEN HERE LONG?"

"OH! THESE TEN AGES AT LEAST. I AM SURE I HAVE BEEN HERE THIS HALF HOUR.
BUT NOW, LET US GO AND SIT DOWN AT THE OTHER END OF THE ROOM, AND ENJOY
OURSELVES. I HAVE AN HUNDRED THINGS TO SAY TO YOU. IN THE FIRST PLACE,
I WAS SO AFRAID IT WOULD RAIN THIS MORNING, JUST AS I WANTED TO SET OFF;
IT LOOKED VERY SHOWERY, AND THAT WOULD HAVE THROWN ME INTO AGONIES! DO
YOU KNOW, I SAW THE PRETTIEST HAT YOU CAN IMAGINE, IN A SHOP WINDOW IN
MILSOM STREET JUST NOW--VERY LIKE YOURS, ONLY WITH COQUELICOT RIBBONS
INSTEAD OF GREEN; I QUITE LONGED FOR IT. BUT, MY DEAREST CATHERINE, WHAT
HAVE YOU BEEN DOING WITH YOURSELF ALL THIS MORNING? HAVE YOU GONE ON
WITH UDOLPHO?"

"YES, I HAVE BEEN READING IT EVER SINCE I WOKE; AND I AM GOT TO THE
BLACK VEIL."

"ARE YOU, INDEED? HOW DELIGHTFUL! OH! I WOULD NOT TELL YOU WHAT IS
BEHIND THE BLACK VEIL FOR THE WORLD! ARE NOT YOU WILD TO KNOW?"

"OH! YES, QUITE; WHAT CAN IT BE? BUT DO NOT TELL ME--I WOULD NOT BE
TOLD UPON ANY ACCOUNT. I KNOW IT MUST BE A SKELETON, I AM SURE IT IS
LAURENTINA'S SKELETON. OH! I AM DELIGHTED WITH THE BOOK! I SHOULD LIKE
TO SPEND MY WHOLE LIFE IN READING IT. I ASSURE YOU, IF IT HAD NOT BEEN
TO MEET YOU, I WOULD NOT HAVE COME AWAY FROM IT FOR ALL THE WORLD."

"DEAR CREATURE! HOW MUCH I AM OBLIGED TO YOU; AND WHEN YOU HAVE FINISHED
UDOLPHO, WE WILL READ THE ITALIAN TOGETHER; AND I HAVE MADE OUT A LIST
OF TEN OR TWELVE MORE OF THE SAME KIND FOR YOU."

"HAVE YOU, INDEED! HOW GLAD I AM! WHAT ARE THEY ALL?"

"I WILL READ YOU THEIR NAMES DIRECTLY; HERE THEY ARE, IN MY POCKETBOOK.
CASTLE OF WOLFENBACH, CLERMONT, MYSTERIOUS WARNINGS, NECROMANCER OF THE
BLACK FOREST, MIDNIGHT BELL, ORPHAN OF THE RHINE, AND HORRID MYSTERIES.
THOSE WILL LAST US SOME TIME."

"YES, PRETTY WELL; BUT ARE THEY ALL HORRID, ARE YOU SURE THEY ARE ALL
HORRID?"

"YES, QUITE SURE; FOR A PARTICULAR FRIEND OF MINE, A MISS ANDREWS, A
SWEET GIRL, ONE OF THE SWEETEST CREATURES IN THE WORLD, HAS READ EVERY
ONE OF THEM. I WISH YOU KNEW MISS ANDREWS, YOU WOULD BE DELIGHTED WITH
HER. SHE IS NETTING HERSELF THE SWEETEST CLOAK YOU CAN CONCEIVE. I THINK
HER AS BEAUTIFUL AS AN ANGEL, AND I AM SO VEXED WITH THE MEN FOR NOT
ADMIRING HER! I SCOLD THEM ALL AMAZINGLY ABOUT IT."

"SCOLD THEM! DO YOU SCOLD THEM FOR NOT ADMIRING HER?"

"YES, THAT I DO. THERE IS NOTHING I WOULD NOT DO FOR THOSE WHO ARE
REALLY MY FRIENDS. I HAVE NO NOTION OF LOVING PEOPLE BY HALVES; IT IS
NOT MY NATURE. MY ATTACHMENTS ARE ALWAYS EXCESSIVELY STRONG. I TOLD
CAPTAIN HUNT AT ONE OF OUR ASSEMBLIES THIS WINTER THAT IF HE WAS TO
TEASE ME ALL NIGHT, I WOULD NOT DANCE WITH HIM, UNLESS HE WOULD ALLOW
MISS ANDREWS TO BE AS BEAUTIFUL AS AN ANGEL. THE MEN THINK US INCAPABLE
OF REAL FRIENDSHIP, YOU KNOW, AND I AM DETERMINED TO SHOW THEM THE
DIFFERENCE. NOW, IF I WERE TO HEAR ANYBODY SPEAK SLIGHTINGLY OF YOU, I
SHOULD FIRE UP IN A MOMENT: BUT THAT IS NOT AT ALL LIKELY, FOR YOU ARE
JUST THE KIND OF GIRL TO BE A GREAT FAVOURITE WITH THE MEN."

"OH, DEAR!" CRIED CATHERINE, COLOURING. "HOW CAN YOU SAY SO?"

"I KNOW YOU VERY WELL; YOU HAVE SO MUCH ANIMATION, WHICH IS EXACTLY
WHAT MISS ANDREWS WANTS, FOR I MUST CONFESS THERE IS SOMETHING AMAZINGLY
INSIPID ABOUT HER. OH! I MUST TELL YOU, THAT JUST AFTER WE PARTED
YESTERDAY, I SAW A YOUNG MAN LOOKING AT YOU SO EARNESTLY--I AM SURE HE
IS IN LOVE WITH YOU." CATHERINE COLOURED, AND DISCLAIMED AGAIN. ISABELLA
LAUGHED. "IT IS VERY TRUE, UPON MY HONOUR, BUT I SEE HOW IT IS; YOU ARE
INDIFFERENT TO EVERYBODY'S ADMIRATION, EXCEPT THAT OF ONE GENTLEMAN,
WHO SHALL BE NAMELESS. NAY, I CANNOT BLAME YOU"--SPEAKING MORE
SERIOUSLY--"YOUR FEELINGS ARE EASILY UNDERSTOOD. WHERE THE HEART IS
REALLY ATTACHED, I KNOW VERY WELL HOW LITTLE ONE CAN BE PLEASED WITH THE
ATTENTION OF ANYBODY ELSE. EVERYTHING IS SO INSIPID, SO UNINTERESTING,
THAT DOES NOT RELATE TO THE BELOVED OBJECT! I CAN PERFECTLY COMPREHEND
YOUR FEELINGS."

"BUT YOU SHOULD NOT PERSUADE ME THAT I THINK SO VERY MUCH ABOUT MR.
TILNEY, FOR PERHAPS I MAY NEVER SEE HIM AGAIN."

"NOT SEE HIM AGAIN! MY DEAREST CREATURE, DO NOT TALK OF IT. I AM SURE
YOU WOULD BE MISERABLE IF YOU THOUGHT SO!"

"NO, INDEED, I SHOULD NOT. I DO NOT PRETEND TO SAY THAT I WAS NOT VERY
MUCH PLEASED WITH HIM; BUT WHILE I HAVE UDOLPHO TO READ, I FEEL AS IF
NOBODY COULD MAKE ME MISERABLE. OH! THE DREADFUL BLACK VEIL! MY DEAR
ISABELLA, I AM SURE THERE MUST BE LAURENTINA'S SKELETON BEHIND IT."

"IT IS SO ODD TO ME, THAT YOU SHOULD NEVER HAVE READ UDOLPHO BEFORE; BUT
I SUPPOSE MRS. MORLAND OBJECTS TO NOVELS."

"NO, SHE DOES NOT. SHE VERY OFTEN READS SIR CHARLES GRANDISON HERSELF;
BUT NEW BOOKS DO NOT FALL IN OUR WAY."

"SIR CHARLES GRANDISON! THAT IS AN AMAZING HORRID BOOK, IS IT NOT? I
REMEMBER MISS ANDREWS COULD NOT GET THROUGH THE FIRST VOLUME."

"IT IS NOT LIKE UDOLPHO AT ALL; BUT YET I THINK IT IS VERY
ENTERTAINING."

"DO YOU INDEED! YOU SURPRISE ME; I THOUGHT IT HAD NOT BEEN READABLE.
BUT, MY DEAREST CATHERINE, HAVE YOU SETTLED WHAT TO WEAR ON YOUR HEAD
TONIGHT? I AM DETERMINED AT ALL EVENTS TO BE DRESSED EXACTLY LIKE YOU.
THE MEN TAKE NOTICE OF THAT SOMETIMES, YOU KNOW."

"BUT IT DOES NOT SIGNIFY IF THEY DO," SAID CATHERINE, VERY INNOCENTLY.

"SIGNIFY! OH, HEAVENS! I MAKE IT A RULE NEVER TO MIND WHAT THEY SAY.
THEY ARE VERY OFTEN AMAZINGLY IMPERTINENT IF YOU DO NOT TREAT THEM WITH
SPIRIT, AND MAKE THEM KEEP THEIR DISTANCE."

"ARE THEY? WELL, I NEVER OBSERVED THAT. THEY ALWAYS BEHAVE VERY WELL TO
ME."

"OH! THEY GIVE THEMSELVES SUCH AIRS. THEY ARE THE MOST CONCEITED
CREATURES IN THE WORLD, AND THINK THEMSELVES OF SO MUCH IMPORTANCE!
BY THE BY, THOUGH I HAVE THOUGHT OF IT A HUNDRED TIMES, I HAVE ALWAYS
FORGOT TO ASK YOU WHAT IS YOUR FAVOURITE COMPLEXION IN A MAN. DO YOU
LIKE THEM BEST DARK OR FAIR?"

"I HARDLY KNOW. I NEVER MUCH THOUGHT ABOUT IT. SOMETHING BETWEEN BOTH, I
THINK. BROWN--NOT FAIR, AND--AND NOT VERY DARK."

"VERY WELL, CATHERINE. THAT IS EXACTLY HE. I HAVE NOT FORGOT YOUR
DESCRIPTION OF MR. TILNEY--'A BROWN SKIN, WITH DARK EYES, AND RATHER
DARK HAIR.' WELL, MY TASTE IS DIFFERENT. I PREFER LIGHT EYES, AND AS TO
COMPLEXION--DO YOU KNOW--I LIKE A SALLOW BETTER THAN ANY OTHER. YOU MUST
NOT BETRAY ME, IF YOU SHOULD EVER MEET WITH ONE OF YOUR ACQUAINTANCE
ANSWERING THAT DESCRIPTION."

"BETRAY YOU! WHAT DO YOU MEAN?"

"NAY, DO NOT DISTRESS ME. I BELIEVE I HAVE SAID TOO MUCH. LET US DROP
THE SUBJECT."

CATHERINE, IN SOME AMAZEMENT, COMPLIED, AND AFTER REMAINING A FEW
MOMENTS SILENT, WAS ON THE POINT OF REVERTING TO WHAT INTERESTED HER
AT THAT TIME RATHER MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE IN THE WORLD, LAURENTINA'S
SKELETON, WHEN HER FRIEND PREVENTED HER, BY SAYING, "FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE!
LET US MOVE AWAY FROM THIS END OF THE ROOM. DO YOU KNOW, THERE ARE TWO
ODIOUS YOUNG MEN WHO HAVE BEEN STARING AT ME THIS HALF HOUR. THEY REALLY
PUT ME QUITE OUT OF COUNTENANCE. LET US GO AND LOOK AT THE ARRIVALS.
THEY WILL HARDLY FOLLOW US THERE."

AWAY THEY WALKED TO THE BOOK; AND WHILE ISABELLA EXAMINED THE NAMES, IT
WAS CATHERINE'S EMPLOYMENT TO WATCH THE PROCEEDINGS OF THESE ALARMING
YOUNG MEN.

"THEY ARE NOT COMING THIS WAY, ARE THEY? I HOPE THEY ARE NOT SO
IMPERTINENT AS TO FOLLOW US. PRAY LET ME KNOW IF THEY ARE COMING. I AM
DETERMINED I WILL NOT LOOK UP."

IN A FEW MOMENTS CATHERINE, WITH UNAFFECTED PLEASURE, ASSURED HER
THAT SHE NEED NOT BE LONGER UNEASY, AS THE GENTLEMEN HAD JUST LEFT THE
PUMP-ROOM.

"AND WHICH WAY ARE THEY GONE?" SAID ISABELLA, TURNING HASTILY ROUND.
"ONE WAS A VERY GOOD-LOOKING YOUNG MAN."

"THEY WENT TOWARDS THE CHURCH-YARD."

"WELL, I AM AMAZINGLY GLAD I HAVE GOT RID OF THEM! AND NOW, WHAT SAY YOU
TO GOING TO EDGAR'S BUILDINGS WITH ME, AND LOOKING AT MY NEW HAT? YOU
SAID YOU SHOULD LIKE TO SEE IT."

CATHERINE READILY AGREED. "ONLY," SHE ADDED, "PERHAPS WE MAY OVERTAKE
THE TWO YOUNG MEN."

"OH! NEVER MIND THAT. IF WE MAKE HASTE, WE SHALL PASS BY THEM PRESENTLY,
AND I AM DYING TO SHOW YOU MY HAT."

"BUT IF WE ONLY WAIT A FEW MINUTES, THERE WILL BE NO DANGER OF OUR
SEEING THEM AT ALL."

"I SHALL NOT PAY THEM ANY SUCH COMPLIMENT, I ASSURE YOU. I HAVE NO
NOTION OF TREATING MEN WITH SUCH RESPECT. THAT IS THE WAY TO SPOIL
THEM."

CATHERINE HAD NOTHING TO OPPOSE AGAINST SUCH REASONING; AND THEREFORE,
TO SHOW THE INDEPENDENCE OF MISS THORPE, AND HER RESOLUTION OF HUMBLING
THE SEX, THEY SET OFF IMMEDIATELY AS FAST AS THEY COULD WALK, IN PURSUIT
OF THE TWO YOUNG MEN.




CHAPTER 7


HALF A MINUTE CONDUCTED THEM THROUGH THE PUMP-YARD TO THE ARCHWAY,
OPPOSITE UNION PASSAGE; BUT HERE THEY WERE STOPPED. EVERYBODY ACQUAINTED
WITH BATH MAY REMEMBER THE DIFFICULTIES OF CROSSING CHEAP STREET AT
THIS POINT; IT IS INDEED A STREET OF SO IMPERTINENT A NATURE, SO
UNFORTUNATELY CONNECTED WITH THE GREAT LONDON AND OXFORD ROADS, AND THE
PRINCIPAL INN OF THE CITY, THAT A DAY NEVER PASSES IN WHICH PARTIES OF
LADIES, HOWEVER IMPORTANT THEIR BUSINESS, WHETHER IN QUEST OF PASTRY,
MILLINERY, OR EVEN (AS IN THE PRESENT CASE) OF YOUNG MEN, ARE NOT
DETAINED ON ONE SIDE OR OTHER BY CARRIAGES, HORSEMEN, OR CARTS. THIS
EVIL HAD BEEN FELT AND LAMENTED, AT LEAST THREE TIMES A DAY, BY ISABELLA
SINCE HER RESIDENCE IN BATH; AND SHE WAS NOW FATED TO FEEL AND LAMENT IT
ONCE MORE, FOR AT THE VERY MOMENT OF COMING OPPOSITE TO UNION PASSAGE,
AND WITHIN VIEW OF THE TWO GENTLEMEN WHO WERE PROCEEDING THROUGH THE
CROWDS, AND THREADING THE GUTTERS OF THAT INTERESTING ALLEY, THEY
WERE PREVENTED CROSSING BY THE APPROACH OF A GIG, DRIVEN ALONG ON BAD
PAVEMENT BY A MOST KNOWING-LOOKING COACHMAN WITH ALL THE VEHEMENCE THAT
COULD MOST FITLY ENDANGER THE LIVES OF HIMSELF, HIS COMPANION, AND HIS
HORSE.

"OH, THESE ODIOUS GIGS!" SAID ISABELLA, LOOKING UP. "HOW I DETEST THEM."
BUT THIS DETESTATION, THOUGH SO JUST, WAS OF SHORT DURATION, FOR SHE
LOOKED AGAIN AND EXCLAIMED, "DELIGHTFUL! MR. MORLAND AND MY BROTHER!"

"GOOD HEAVEN! 'TIS JAMES!" WAS UTTERED AT THE SAME MOMENT BY CATHERINE;
AND, ON CATCHING THE YOUNG MEN'S EYES, THE HORSE WAS IMMEDIATELY CHECKED
WITH A VIOLENCE WHICH ALMOST THREW HIM ON HIS HAUNCHES, AND THE SERVANT
HAVING NOW SCAMPERED UP, THE GENTLEMEN JUMPED OUT, AND THE EQUIPAGE WAS
DELIVERED TO HIS CARE.

CATHERINE, BY WHOM THIS MEETING WAS WHOLLY UNEXPECTED, RECEIVED HER
BROTHER WITH THE LIVELIEST PLEASURE; AND HE, BEING OF A VERY AMIABLE
DISPOSITION, AND SINCERELY ATTACHED TO HER, GAVE EVERY PROOF ON HIS
SIDE OF EQUAL SATISFACTION, WHICH HE COULD HAVE LEISURE TO DO, WHILE THE
BRIGHT EYES OF MISS THORPE WERE INCESSANTLY CHALLENGING HIS NOTICE;
AND TO HER HIS DEVOIRS WERE SPEEDILY PAID, WITH A MIXTURE OF JOY AND
EMBARRASSMENT WHICH MIGHT HAVE INFORMED CATHERINE, HAD SHE BEEN MORE
EXPERT IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF OTHER PEOPLE'S FEELINGS, AND LESS SIMPLY
ENGROSSED BY HER OWN, THAT HER BROTHER THOUGHT HER FRIEND QUITE AS
PRETTY AS SHE COULD DO HERSELF.

JOHN THORPE, WHO IN THE MEANTIME HAD BEEN GIVING ORDERS ABOUT THE
HORSES, SOON JOINED THEM, AND FROM HIM SHE DIRECTLY RECEIVED THE AMENDS
WHICH WERE HER DUE; FOR WHILE HE SLIGHTLY AND CARELESSLY TOUCHED THE
HAND OF ISABELLA, ON HER HE BESTOWED A WHOLE SCRAPE AND HALF A SHORT
BOW. HE WAS A STOUT YOUNG MAN OF MIDDLING HEIGHT, WHO, WITH A PLAIN FACE
AND UNGRACEFUL FORM, SEEMED FEARFUL OF BEING TOO HANDSOME UNLESS HE WORE
THE DRESS OF A GROOM, AND TOO MUCH LIKE A GENTLEMAN UNLESS HE WERE EASY
WHERE HE OUGHT TO BE CIVIL, AND IMPUDENT WHERE HE MIGHT BE ALLOWED TO BE
EASY. HE TOOK OUT HIS WATCH: "HOW LONG DO YOU THINK WE HAVE BEEN RUNNING
IT FROM TETBURY, MISS MORLAND?"

"I DO NOT KNOW THE DISTANCE." HER BROTHER TOLD HER THAT IT WAS
TWENTY-THREE MILES.

"THREE AND TWENTY!" CRIED THORPE. "FIVE AND TWENTY IF IT IS AN INCH."
MORLAND REMONSTRATED, PLEADED THE AUTHORITY OF ROAD-BOOKS, INNKEEPERS,
AND MILESTONES; BUT HIS FRIEND DISREGARDED THEM ALL; HE HAD A SURER TEST
OF DISTANCE. "I KNOW IT MUST BE FIVE AND TWENTY," SAID HE, "BY THE TIME
WE HAVE BEEN DOING IT. IT IS NOW HALF AFTER ONE; WE DROVE OUT OF THE
INN-YARD AT TETBURY AS THE TOWN CLOCK STRUCK ELEVEN; AND I DEFY ANY MAN
IN ENGLAND TO MAKE MY HORSE GO LESS THAN TEN MILES AN HOUR IN HARNESS;
THAT MAKES IT EXACTLY TWENTY-FIVE."

"YOU HAVE LOST AN HOUR," SAID MORLAND; "IT WAS ONLY TEN O'CLOCK WHEN WE
CAME FROM TETBURY."

"TEN O'CLOCK! IT WAS ELEVEN, UPON MY SOUL! I COUNTED EVERY STROKE. THIS
BROTHER OF YOURS WOULD PERSUADE ME OUT OF MY SENSES, MISS MORLAND; DO
BUT LOOK AT MY HORSE; DID YOU EVER SEE AN ANIMAL SO MADE FOR SPEED IN
YOUR LIFE?" (THE SERVANT HAD JUST MOUNTED THE CARRIAGE AND WAS DRIVING
OFF.) "SUCH TRUE BLOOD! THREE HOURS AND AND A HALF INDEED COMING ONLY
THREE AND TWENTY MILES! LOOK AT THAT CREATURE, AND SUPPOSE IT POSSIBLE
IF YOU CAN."

"HE DOES LOOK VERY HOT, TO BE SURE."

"HOT! HE HAD NOT TURNED A HAIR TILL WE CAME TO WALCOT CHURCH; BUT LOOK
AT HIS FOREHAND; LOOK AT HIS LOINS; ONLY SEE HOW HE MOVES; THAT HORSE
CANNOT GO LESS THAN TEN MILES AN HOUR: TIE HIS LEGS AND HE WILL GET ON.
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF MY GIG, MISS MORLAND? A NEAT ONE, IS NOT IT?
WELL HUNG; TOWN-BUILT; I HAVE NOT HAD IT A MONTH. IT WAS BUILT FOR A
CHRISTCHURCH MAN, A FRIEND OF MINE, A VERY GOOD SORT OF FELLOW; HE RAN
IT A FEW WEEKS, TILL, I BELIEVE, IT WAS CONVENIENT TO HAVE DONE WITH IT.
I HAPPENED JUST THEN TO BE LOOKING OUT FOR SOME LIGHT THING OF THE KIND,
THOUGH I HAD PRETTY WELL DETERMINED ON A CURRICLE TOO; BUT I CHANCED TO
MEET HIM ON MAGDALEN BRIDGE, AS HE WAS DRIVING INTO OXFORD, LAST TERM:
'AH! THORPE,' SAID HE, 'DO YOU HAPPEN TO WANT SUCH A LITTLE THING AS
THIS? IT IS A CAPITAL ONE OF THE KIND, BUT I AM CURSED TIRED OF IT.'
'OH! D--,' SAID I; 'I AM YOUR MAN; WHAT DO YOU ASK?' AND HOW MUCH DO YOU
THINK HE DID, MISS MORLAND?"

"I AM SURE I CANNOT GUESS AT ALL."

"CURRICLE-HUNG, YOU SEE; SEAT, TRUNK, SWORD-CASE, SPLASHING-BOARD,
LAMPS, SILVER MOULDING, ALL YOU SEE COMPLETE; THE IRON-WORK AS GOOD
AS NEW, OR BETTER. HE ASKED FIFTY GUINEAS; I CLOSED WITH HIM DIRECTLY,
THREW DOWN THE MONEY, AND THE CARRIAGE WAS MINE."

"AND I AM SURE," SAID CATHERINE, "I KNOW SO LITTLE OF SUCH THINGS THAT I
CANNOT JUDGE WHETHER IT WAS CHEAP OR DEAR."

"NEITHER ONE NOR T'OTHER; I MIGHT HAVE GOT IT FOR LESS, I DARE SAY; BUT
I HATE HAGGLING, AND POOR FREEMAN WANTED CASH."

"THAT WAS VERY GOOD-NATURED OF YOU," SAID CATHERINE, QUITE PLEASED.

"OH! D---- IT, WHEN ONE HAS THE MEANS OF DOING A KIND THING BY A FRIEND,
I HATE TO BE PITIFUL."

AN INQUIRY NOW TOOK PLACE INTO THE INTENDED MOVEMENTS OF THE YOUNG
LADIES; AND, ON FINDING WHITHER THEY WERE GOING, IT WAS DECIDED THAT
THE GENTLEMEN SHOULD ACCOMPANY THEM TO EDGAR'S BUILDINGS, AND PAY THEIR
RESPECTS TO MRS. THORPE. JAMES AND ISABELLA LED THE WAY; AND SO
WELL SATISFIED WAS THE LATTER WITH HER LOT, SO CONTENTEDLY WAS SHE
ENDEAVOURING TO ENSURE A PLEASANT WALK TO HIM WHO BROUGHT THE DOUBLE
RECOMMENDATION OF BEING HER BROTHER'S FRIEND, AND HER FRIEND'S BROTHER,
SO PURE AND UNCOQUETTISH WERE HER FEELINGS, THAT, THOUGH THEY OVERTOOK
AND PASSED THE TWO OFFENDING YOUNG MEN IN MILSOM STREET, SHE WAS SO FAR
FROM SEEKING TO ATTRACT THEIR NOTICE, THAT SHE LOOKED BACK AT THEM ONLY
THREE TIMES.

JOHN THORPE KEPT OF COURSE WITH CATHERINE, AND, AFTER A FEW MINUTES'
SILENCE, RENEWED THE CONVERSATION ABOUT HIS GIG. "YOU WILL FIND,
HOWEVER, MISS MORLAND, IT WOULD BE RECKONED A CHEAP THING BY SOME
PEOPLE, FOR I MIGHT HAVE SOLD IT FOR TEN GUINEAS MORE THE NEXT DAY;
JACKSON, OF ORIEL, BID ME SIXTY AT ONCE; MORLAND WAS WITH ME AT THE
TIME."

"YES," SAID MORLAND, WHO OVERHEARD THIS; "BUT YOU FORGET THAT YOUR HORSE
WAS INCLUDED."

"MY HORSE! OH, D---- IT! I WOULD NOT SELL MY HORSE FOR A HUNDRED. ARE
YOU FOND OF AN OPEN CARRIAGE, MISS MORLAND?"

"YES, VERY; I HAVE HARDLY EVER AN OPPORTUNITY OF BEING IN ONE; BUT I AM
PARTICULARLY FOND OF IT."

"I AM GLAD OF IT; I WILL DRIVE YOU OUT IN MINE EVERY DAY."

"THANK YOU," SAID CATHERINE, IN SOME DISTRESS, FROM A DOUBT OF THE
PROPRIETY OF ACCEPTING SUCH AN OFFER.

"I WILL DRIVE YOU UP LANSDOWN HILL TOMORROW."

"THANK YOU; BUT WILL NOT YOUR HORSE WANT REST?"

"REST! HE HAS ONLY COME THREE AND TWENTY MILES TODAY; ALL NONSENSE;
NOTHING RUINS HORSES SO MUCH AS REST; NOTHING KNOCKS THEM UP SO SOON.
NO, NO; I SHALL EXERCISE MINE AT THE AVERAGE OF FOUR HOURS EVERY DAY
WHILE I AM HERE."

"SHALL YOU INDEED!" SAID CATHERINE VERY SERIOUSLY. "THAT WILL BE FORTY
MILES A DAY."

"FORTY! AYE, FIFTY, FOR WHAT I CARE. WELL, I WILL DRIVE YOU UP LANSDOWN
TOMORROW; MIND, I AM ENGAGED."

"HOW DELIGHTFUL THAT WILL BE!" CRIED ISABELLA, TURNING ROUND. "MY
DEAREST CATHERINE, I QUITE ENVY YOU; BUT I AM AFRAID, BROTHER, YOU WILL
NOT HAVE ROOM FOR A THIRD."

"A THIRD INDEED! NO, NO; I DID NOT COME TO BATH TO DRIVE MY SISTERS
ABOUT; THAT WOULD BE A GOOD JOKE, FAITH! MORLAND MUST TAKE CARE OF YOU."

THIS BROUGHT ON A DIALOGUE OF CIVILITIES BETWEEN THE OTHER TWO; BUT
CATHERINE HEARD NEITHER THE PARTICULARS NOR THE RESULT. HER COMPANION'S
DISCOURSE NOW SUNK FROM ITS HITHERTO ANIMATED PITCH TO NOTHING MORE THAN
A SHORT DECISIVE SENTENCE OF PRAISE OR CONDEMNATION ON THE FACE OF EVERY
WOMAN THEY MET; AND CATHERINE, AFTER LISTENING AND AGREEING AS LONG AS
SHE COULD, WITH ALL THE CIVILITY AND DEFERENCE OF THE YOUTHFUL FEMALE
MIND, FEARFUL OF HAZARDING AN OPINION OF ITS OWN IN OPPOSITION TO THAT
OF A SELF-ASSURED MAN, ESPECIALLY WHERE THE BEAUTY OF HER OWN SEX IS
CONCERNED, VENTURED AT LENGTH TO VARY THE SUBJECT BY A QUESTION WHICH
HAD BEEN LONG UPPERMOST IN HER THOUGHTS; IT WAS, "HAVE YOU EVER READ
UDOLPHO, MR. THORPE?"

"UDOLPHO! OH, LORD! NOT I; I NEVER READ NOVELS; I HAVE SOMETHING ELSE TO
DO."

CATHERINE, HUMBLED AND ASHAMED, WAS GOING TO APOLOGIZE FOR HER QUESTION,
BUT HE PREVENTED HER BY SAYING, "NOVELS ARE ALL SO FULL OF NONSENSE
AND STUFF; THERE HAS NOT BEEN A TOLERABLY DECENT ONE COME OUT SINCE
TOM JONES, EXCEPT THE MONK; I READ THAT T'OTHER DAY; BUT AS FOR ALL THE
OTHERS, THEY ARE THE STUPIDEST THINGS IN CREATION."

"I THINK YOU MUST LIKE UDOLPHO, IF YOU WERE TO READ IT; IT IS SO VERY
INTERESTING."

"NOT I, FAITH! NO, IF I READ ANY, IT SHALL BE MRS. RADCLIFFE'S; HER
NOVELS ARE AMUSING ENOUGH; THEY ARE WORTH READING; SOME FUN AND NATURE
IN THEM."

"UDOLPHO WAS WRITTEN BY MRS. RADCLIFFE," SAID CATHERINE, WITH SOME
HESITATION, FROM THE FEAR OF MORTIFYING HIM.

"NO SURE; WAS IT? AYE, I REMEMBER, SO IT WAS; I WAS THINKING OF THAT
OTHER STUPID BOOK, WRITTEN BY THAT WOMAN THEY MAKE SUCH A FUSS ABOUT,
SHE WHO MARRIED THE FRENCH EMIGRANT."

"I SUPPOSE YOU MEAN CAMILLA?"

"YES, THAT'S THE BOOK; SUCH UNNATURAL STUFF! AN OLD MAN PLAYING AT
SEE-SAW, I TOOK UP THE FIRST VOLUME ONCE AND LOOKED IT OVER, BUT I SOON
FOUND IT WOULD NOT DO; INDEED I GUESSED WHAT SORT OF STUFF IT MUST BE
BEFORE I SAW IT: AS SOON AS I HEARD SHE HAD MARRIED AN EMIGRANT, I WAS
SURE I SHOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO GET THROUGH IT."

"I HAVE NEVER READ IT."

"YOU HAD NO LOSS, I ASSURE YOU; IT IS THE HORRIDEST NONSENSE YOU CAN
IMAGINE; THERE IS NOTHING IN THE WORLD IN IT BUT AN OLD MAN'S PLAYING AT
SEE-SAW AND LEARNING LATIN; UPON MY SOUL THERE IS NOT."

THIS CRITIQUE, THE JUSTNESS OF WHICH WAS UNFORTUNATELY LOST ON POOR
CATHERINE, BROUGHT THEM TO THE DOOR OF MRS. THORPE'S LODGINGS, AND THE
FEELINGS OF THE DISCERNING AND UNPREJUDICED READER OF CAMILLA GAVE WAY
TO THE FEELINGS OF THE DUTIFUL AND AFFECTIONATE SON, AS THEY MET MRS.
THORPE, WHO HAD DESCRIED THEM FROM ABOVE, IN THE PASSAGE. "AH, MOTHER!
HOW DO YOU DO?" SAID HE, GIVING HER A HEARTY SHAKE OF THE HAND. "WHERE
DID YOU GET THAT QUIZ OF A HAT? IT MAKES YOU LOOK LIKE AN OLD WITCH.
HERE IS MORLAND AND I COME TO STAY A FEW DAYS WITH YOU, SO YOU MUST LOOK
OUT FOR A COUPLE OF GOOD BEDS SOMEWHERE NEAR." AND THIS ADDRESS SEEMED
TO SATISFY ALL THE FONDEST WISHES OF THE MOTHER'S HEART, FOR SHE
RECEIVED HIM WITH THE MOST DELIGHTED AND EXULTING AFFECTION. ON HIS
TWO YOUNGER SISTERS HE THEN BESTOWED AN EQUAL PORTION OF HIS FRATERNAL
TENDERNESS, FOR HE ASKED EACH OF THEM HOW THEY DID, AND OBSERVED THAT
THEY BOTH LOOKED VERY UGLY.

THESE MANNERS DID NOT PLEASE CATHERINE; BUT HE WAS JAMES'S FRIEND
AND ISABELLA'S BROTHER; AND HER JUDGMENT WAS FURTHER BOUGHT OFF BY
ISABELLA'S ASSURING HER, WHEN THEY WITHDREW TO SEE THE NEW HAT, THAT
JOHN THOUGHT HER THE MOST CHARMING GIRL IN THE WORLD, AND BY JOHN'S
ENGAGING HER BEFORE THEY PARTED TO DANCE WITH HIM THAT EVENING. HAD SHE
BEEN OLDER OR VAINER, SUCH ATTACKS MIGHT HAVE DONE LITTLE; BUT, WHERE
YOUTH AND DIFFIDENCE ARE UNITED, IT REQUIRES UNCOMMON STEADINESS OF
REASON TO RESIST THE ATTRACTION OF BEING CALLED THE MOST CHARMING GIRL
IN THE WORLD, AND OF BEING SO VERY EARLY ENGAGED AS A PARTNER; AND THE
CONSEQUENCE WAS THAT, WHEN THE TWO MORLANDS, AFTER SITTING AN HOUR WITH
THE THORPES, SET OFF TO WALK TOGETHER TO MR. ALLEN'S, AND JAMES, AS
THE DOOR WAS CLOSED ON THEM, SAID, "WELL, CATHERINE, HOW DO YOU LIKE MY
FRIEND THORPE?" INSTEAD OF ANSWERING, AS SHE PROBABLY WOULD HAVE DONE,
HAD THERE BEEN NO FRIENDSHIP AND NO FLATTERY IN THE CASE, "I DO NOT LIKE
HIM AT ALL," SHE DIRECTLY REPLIED, "I LIKE HIM VERY MUCH; HE SEEMS VERY
AGREEABLE."

"HE IS AS GOOD-NATURED A FELLOW AS EVER LIVED; A LITTLE OF A RATTLE; BUT
THAT WILL RECOMMEND HIM TO YOUR SEX, I BELIEVE: AND HOW DO YOU LIKE THE
REST OF THE FAMILY?"

"VERY, VERY MUCH INDEED: ISABELLA PARTICULARLY."

"I AM VERY GLAD TO HEAR YOU SAY SO; SHE IS JUST THE KIND OF YOUNG WOMAN
I COULD WISH TO SEE YOU ATTACHED TO; SHE HAS SO MUCH GOOD SENSE, AND IS
SO THOROUGHLY UNAFFECTED AND AMIABLE; I ALWAYS WANTED YOU TO KNOW HER;
AND SHE SEEMS VERY FOND OF YOU. SHE SAID THE HIGHEST THINGS IN YOUR
PRAISE THAT COULD POSSIBLY BE; AND THE PRAISE OF SUCH A GIRL AS MISS
THORPE EVEN YOU, CATHERINE," TAKING HER HAND WITH AFFECTION, "MAY BE
PROUD OF."

"INDEED I AM," SHE REPLIED; "I LOVE HER EXCEEDINGLY, AND AM DELIGHTED
TO FIND THAT YOU LIKE HER TOO. YOU HARDLY MENTIONED ANYTHING OF HER WHEN
YOU WROTE TO ME AFTER YOUR VISIT THERE."

"BECAUSE I THOUGHT I SHOULD SOON SEE YOU MYSELF. I HOPE YOU WILL BE A
GREAT DEAL TOGETHER WHILE YOU ARE IN BATH. SHE IS A MOST AMIABLE GIRL;
SUCH A SUPERIOR UNDERSTANDING! HOW FOND ALL THE FAMILY ARE OF HER; SHE
IS EVIDENTLY THE GENERAL FAVOURITE; AND HOW MUCH SHE MUST BE ADMIRED IN
SUCH A PLACE AS THIS--IS NOT SHE?"

"YES, VERY MUCH INDEED, I FANCY; MR. ALLEN THINKS HER THE PRETTIEST GIRL
IN BATH."

"I DARE SAY HE DOES; AND I DO NOT KNOW ANY MAN WHO IS A BETTER JUDGE OF
BEAUTY THAN MR. ALLEN. I NEED NOT ASK YOU WHETHER YOU ARE HAPPY HERE, MY
DEAR CATHERINE; WITH SUCH A COMPANION AND FRIEND AS ISABELLA THORPE, IT
WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU TO BE OTHERWISE; AND THE ALLENS, I AM SURE,
ARE VERY KIND TO YOU?"

"YES, VERY KIND; I NEVER WAS SO HAPPY BEFORE; AND NOW YOU ARE COME IT
WILL BE MORE DELIGHTFUL THAN EVER; HOW GOOD IT IS OF YOU TO COME SO FAR
ON PURPOSE TO SEE ME."

JAMES ACCEPTED THIS TRIBUTE OF GRATITUDE, AND QUALIFIED HIS CONSCIENCE
FOR ACCEPTING IT TOO, BY SAYING WITH PERFECT SINCERITY, "INDEED,
CATHERINE, I LOVE YOU DEARLY."

INQUIRIES AND COMMUNICATIONS CONCERNING BROTHERS AND SISTERS, THE
SITUATION OF SOME, THE GROWTH OF THE REST, AND OTHER FAMILY MATTERS NOW
PASSED BETWEEN THEM, AND CONTINUED, WITH ONLY ONE SMALL DIGRESSION
ON JAMES'S PART, IN PRAISE OF MISS THORPE, TILL THEY REACHED PULTENEY
STREET, WHERE HE WAS WELCOMED WITH GREAT KINDNESS BY MR. AND MRS. ALLEN,
INVITED BY THE FORMER TO DINE WITH THEM, AND SUMMONED BY THE LATTER
TO GUESS THE PRICE AND WEIGH THE MERITS OF A NEW MUFF AND TIPPET.
A PRE-ENGAGEMENT IN EDGAR'S BUILDINGS PREVENTED HIS ACCEPTING THE
INVITATION OF ONE FRIEND, AND OBLIGED HIM TO HURRY AWAY AS SOON AS HE
HAD SATISFIED THE DEMANDS OF THE OTHER. THE TIME OF THE TWO PARTIES
UNITING IN THE OCTAGON ROOM BEING CORRECTLY ADJUSTED, CATHERINE WAS THEN
LEFT TO THE LUXURY OF A RAISED, RESTLESS, AND FRIGHTENED IMAGINATION
OVER THE PAGES OF UDOLPHO, LOST FROM ALL WORLDLY CONCERNS OF DRESSING
AND DINNER, INCAPABLE OF SOOTHING MRS. ALLEN'S FEARS ON THE DELAY OF AN
EXPECTED DRESSMAKER, AND HAVING ONLY ONE MINUTE IN SIXTY TO BESTOW EVEN
ON THE REFLECTION OF HER OWN FELICITY, IN BEING ALREADY ENGAGED FOR THE
EVENING.




CHAPTER 8


IN SPITE OF UDOLPHO AND THE DRESSMAKER, HOWEVER, THE PARTY FROM PULTENEY
STREET REACHED THE UPPER ROOMS IN VERY GOOD TIME. THE THORPES AND JAMES
MORLAND WERE THERE ONLY TWO MINUTES BEFORE THEM; AND ISABELLA HAVING
GONE THROUGH THE USUAL CEREMONIAL OF MEETING HER FRIEND WITH THE MOST
SMILING AND AFFECTIONATE HASTE, OF ADMIRING THE SET OF HER GOWN, AND
ENVYING THE CURL OF HER HAIR, THEY FOLLOWED THEIR CHAPERONES, ARM IN
ARM, INTO THE BALLROOM, WHISPERING TO EACH OTHER WHENEVER A THOUGHT
OCCURRED, AND SUPPLYING THE PLACE OF MANY IDEAS BY A SQUEEZE OF THE HAND
OR A SMILE OF AFFECTION.

THE DANCING BEGAN WITHIN A FEW MINUTES AFTER THEY WERE SEATED; AND
JAMES, WHO HAD BEEN ENGAGED QUITE AS LONG AS HIS SISTER, WAS VERY
IMPORTUNATE WITH ISABELLA TO STAND UP; BUT JOHN WAS GONE INTO THE
CARD-ROOM TO SPEAK TO A FRIEND, AND NOTHING, SHE DECLARED, SHOULD INDUCE
HER TO JOIN THE SET BEFORE HER DEAR CATHERINE COULD JOIN IT TOO. "I
ASSURE YOU," SAID SHE, "I WOULD NOT STAND UP WITHOUT YOUR DEAR SISTER
FOR ALL THE WORLD; FOR IF I DID WE SHOULD CERTAINLY BE SEPARATED THE
WHOLE EVENING." CATHERINE ACCEPTED THIS KINDNESS WITH GRATITUDE, AND
THEY CONTINUED AS THEY WERE FOR THREE MINUTES LONGER, WHEN ISABELLA, WHO
HAD BEEN TALKING TO JAMES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF HER, TURNED AGAIN TO HIS
SISTER AND WHISPERED, "MY DEAR CREATURE, I AM AFRAID I MUST LEAVE YOU,
YOUR BROTHER IS SO AMAZINGLY IMPATIENT TO BEGIN; I KNOW YOU WILL NOT
MIND MY GOING AWAY, AND I DARE SAY JOHN WILL BE BACK IN A MOMENT,
AND THEN YOU MAY EASILY FIND ME OUT." CATHERINE, THOUGH A LITTLE
DISAPPOINTED, HAD TOO MUCH GOOD NATURE TO MAKE ANY OPPOSITION, AND THE
OTHERS RISING UP, ISABELLA HAD ONLY TIME TO PRESS HER FRIEND'S HAND AND
SAY, "GOOD-BYE, MY DEAR LOVE," BEFORE THEY HURRIED OFF. THE YOUNGER
MISS THORPES BEING ALSO DANCING, CATHERINE WAS LEFT TO THE MERCY OF MRS.
THORPE AND MRS. ALLEN, BETWEEN WHOM SHE NOW REMAINED. SHE COULD NOT HELP
BEING VEXED AT THE NON-APPEARANCE OF MR. THORPE, FOR SHE NOT ONLY LONGED
TO BE DANCING, BUT WAS LIKEWISE AWARE THAT, AS THE REAL DIGNITY OF HER
SITUATION COULD NOT BE KNOWN, SHE WAS SHARING WITH THE SCORES OF OTHER
YOUNG LADIES STILL SITTING DOWN ALL THE DISCREDIT OF WANTING A PARTNER.
TO BE DISGRACED IN THE EYE OF THE WORLD, TO WEAR THE APPEARANCE OF
INFAMY WHILE HER HEART IS ALL PURITY, HER ACTIONS ALL INNOCENCE, AND THE
MISCONDUCT OF ANOTHER THE TRUE SOURCE OF HER DEBASEMENT, IS ONE OF THOSE
CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH PECULIARLY BELONG TO THE HEROINE'S LIFE, AND HER
FORTITUDE UNDER IT WHAT PARTICULARLY DIGNIFIES HER CHARACTER. CATHERINE
HAD FORTITUDE TOO; SHE SUFFERED, BUT NO MURMUR PASSED HER LIPS.

FROM THIS STATE OF HUMILIATION, SHE WAS ROUSED, AT THE END OF TEN
MINUTES, TO A PLEASANTER FEELING, BY SEEING, NOT MR. THORPE, BUT MR.
TILNEY, WITHIN THREE YARDS OF THE PLACE WHERE THEY SAT; HE SEEMED TO BE
MOVING THAT WAY, BUT HE DID NOT SEE HER, AND THEREFORE THE SMILE AND THE
BLUSH, WHICH HIS SUDDEN REAPPEARANCE RAISED IN CATHERINE, PASSED AWAY
WITHOUT SULLYING HER HEROIC IMPORTANCE. HE LOOKED AS HANDSOME AND AS
LIVELY AS EVER, AND WAS TALKING WITH INTEREST TO A FASHIONABLE AND
PLEASING-LOOKING YOUNG WOMAN, WHO LEANT ON HIS ARM, AND WHOM CATHERINE
IMMEDIATELY GUESSED TO BE HIS SISTER; THUS UNTHINKINGLY THROWING AWAY
A FAIR OPPORTUNITY OF CONSIDERING HIM LOST TO HER FOREVER, BY BEING
MARRIED ALREADY. BUT GUIDED ONLY BY WHAT WAS SIMPLE AND PROBABLE, IT
HAD NEVER ENTERED HER HEAD THAT MR. TILNEY COULD BE MARRIED; HE HAD NOT
BEHAVED, HE HAD NOT TALKED, LIKE THE MARRIED MEN TO WHOM SHE HAD BEEN
USED; HE HAD NEVER MENTIONED A WIFE, AND HE HAD ACKNOWLEDGED A SISTER.
FROM THESE CIRCUMSTANCES SPRANG THE INSTANT CONCLUSION OF HIS SISTER'S
NOW BEING BY HIS SIDE; AND THEREFORE, INSTEAD OF TURNING OF A DEATHLIKE
PALENESS AND FALLING IN A FIT ON MRS. ALLEN'S BOSOM, CATHERINE SAT
ERECT, IN THE PERFECT USE OF HER SENSES, AND WITH CHEEKS ONLY A LITTLE
REDDER THAN USUAL.

MR. TILNEY AND HIS COMPANION, WHO CONTINUED, THOUGH SLOWLY, TO APPROACH,
WERE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDED BY A LADY, AN ACQUAINTANCE OF MRS. THORPE; AND
THIS LADY STOPPING TO SPEAK TO HER, THEY, AS BELONGING TO HER, STOPPED
LIKEWISE, AND CATHERINE, CATCHING MR. TILNEY'S EYE, INSTANTLY RECEIVED
FROM HIM THE SMILING TRIBUTE OF RECOGNITION. SHE RETURNED IT WITH
PLEASURE, AND THEN ADVANCING STILL NEARER, HE SPOKE BOTH TO HER AND MRS.
ALLEN, BY WHOM HE WAS VERY CIVILLY ACKNOWLEDGED. "I AM VERY HAPPY TO SEE
YOU AGAIN, SIR, INDEED; I WAS AFRAID YOU HAD LEFT BATH." HE THANKED HER
FOR HER FEARS, AND SAID THAT HE HAD QUITTED IT FOR A WEEK, ON THE VERY
MORNING AFTER HIS HAVING HAD THE PLEASURE OF SEEING HER.

"WELL, SIR, AND I DARE SAY YOU ARE NOT SORRY TO BE BACK AGAIN, FOR IT
IS JUST THE PLACE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE--AND INDEED FOR EVERYBODY ELSE TOO.
I TELL MR. ALLEN, WHEN HE TALKS OF BEING SICK OF IT, THAT I AM SURE HE
SHOULD NOT COMPLAIN, FOR IT IS SO VERY AGREEABLE A PLACE, THAT IT IS
MUCH BETTER TO BE HERE THAN AT HOME AT THIS DULL TIME OF YEAR. I TELL
HIM HE IS QUITE IN LUCK TO BE SENT HERE FOR HIS HEALTH."

"AND I HOPE, MADAM, THAT MR. ALLEN WILL BE OBLIGED TO LIKE THE PLACE,
FROM FINDING IT OF SERVICE TO HIM."

"THANK YOU, SIR. I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT HE WILL. A NEIGHBOUR OF OURS,
DR. SKINNER, WAS HERE FOR HIS HEALTH LAST WINTER, AND CAME AWAY QUITE
STOUT."

"THAT CIRCUMSTANCE MUST GIVE GREAT ENCOURAGEMENT."

"YES, SIR--AND DR. SKINNER AND HIS FAMILY WERE HERE THREE MONTHS; SO I
TELL MR. ALLEN HE MUST NOT BE IN A HURRY TO GET AWAY."

HERE THEY WERE INTERRUPTED BY A REQUEST FROM MRS. THORPE TO MRS. ALLEN,
THAT SHE WOULD MOVE A LITTLE TO ACCOMMODATE MRS. HUGHES AND MISS TILNEY
WITH SEATS, AS THEY HAD AGREED TO JOIN THEIR PARTY. THIS WAS ACCORDINGLY
DONE, MR. TILNEY STILL CONTINUING STANDING BEFORE THEM; AND AFTER A
FEW MINUTES' CONSIDERATION, HE ASKED CATHERINE TO DANCE WITH HIM. THIS
COMPLIMENT, DELIGHTFUL AS IT WAS, PRODUCED SEVERE MORTIFICATION TO THE
LADY; AND IN GIVING HER DENIAL, SHE EXPRESSED HER SORROW ON THE OCCASION
SO VERY MUCH AS IF SHE REALLY FELT IT THAT HAD THORPE, WHO JOINED HER
JUST AFTERWARDS, BEEN HALF A MINUTE EARLIER, HE MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT HER
SUFFERINGS RATHER TOO ACUTE. THE VERY EASY MANNER IN WHICH HE THEN TOLD
HER THAT HE HAD KEPT HER WAITING DID NOT BY ANY MEANS RECONCILE HER MORE
TO HER LOT; NOR DID THE PARTICULARS WHICH HE ENTERED INTO WHILE THEY
WERE STANDING UP, OF THE HORSES AND DOGS OF THE FRIEND WHOM HE HAD JUST
LEFT, AND OF A PROPOSED EXCHANGE OF TERRIERS BETWEEN THEM, INTEREST HER
SO MUCH AS TO PREVENT HER LOOKING VERY OFTEN TOWARDS THAT PART OF THE
ROOM WHERE SHE HAD LEFT MR. TILNEY. OF HER DEAR ISABELLA, TO WHOM SHE
PARTICULARLY LONGED TO POINT OUT THAT GENTLEMAN, SHE COULD SEE NOTHING.
THEY WERE IN DIFFERENT SETS. SHE WAS SEPARATED FROM ALL HER PARTY, AND
AWAY FROM ALL HER ACQUAINTANCE; ONE MORTIFICATION SUCCEEDED ANOTHER,
AND FROM THE WHOLE SHE DEDUCED THIS USEFUL LESSON, THAT TO GO PREVIOUSLY
ENGAGED TO A BALL DOES NOT NECESSARILY INCREASE EITHER THE DIGNITY OR
ENJOYMENT OF A YOUNG LADY. FROM SUCH A MORALIZING STRAIN AS THIS, SHE
WAS SUDDENLY ROUSED BY A TOUCH ON THE SHOULDER, AND TURNING ROUND,
PERCEIVED MRS. HUGHES DIRECTLY BEHIND HER, ATTENDED BY MISS TILNEY AND
A GENTLEMAN. "I BEG YOUR PARDON, MISS MORLAND," SAID SHE, "FOR THIS
LIBERTY--BUT I CANNOT ANYHOW GET TO MISS THORPE, AND MRS. THORPE SAID
SHE WAS SURE YOU WOULD NOT HAVE THE LEAST OBJECTION TO LETTING IN THIS
YOUNG LADY BY YOU." MRS. HUGHES COULD NOT HAVE APPLIED TO ANY CREATURE
IN THE ROOM MORE HAPPY TO OBLIGE HER THAN CATHERINE. THE YOUNG LADIES
WERE INTRODUCED TO EACH OTHER, MISS TILNEY EXPRESSING A PROPER SENSE OF
SUCH GOODNESS, MISS MORLAND WITH THE REAL DELICACY OF A GENEROUS MIND
MAKING LIGHT OF THE OBLIGATION; AND MRS. HUGHES, SATISFIED WITH HAVING
SO RESPECTABLY SETTLED HER YOUNG CHARGE, RETURNED TO HER PARTY.

MISS TILNEY HAD A GOOD FIGURE, A PRETTY FACE, AND A VERY AGREEABLE
COUNTENANCE; AND HER AIR, THOUGH IT HAD NOT ALL THE DECIDED PRETENSION,
THE RESOLUTE STYLISHNESS OF MISS THORPE'S, HAD MORE REAL ELEGANCE. HER
MANNERS SHOWED GOOD SENSE AND GOOD BREEDING; THEY WERE NEITHER SHY NOR
AFFECTEDLY OPEN; AND SHE SEEMED CAPABLE OF BEING YOUNG, ATTRACTIVE, AND
AT A BALL WITHOUT WANTING TO FIX THE ATTENTION OF EVERY MAN NEAR HER,
AND WITHOUT EXAGGERATED FEELINGS OF ECSTATIC DELIGHT OR INCONCEIVABLE
VEXATION ON EVERY LITTLE TRIFLING OCCURRENCE. CATHERINE, INTERESTED AT
ONCE BY HER APPEARANCE AND HER RELATIONSHIP TO MR. TILNEY, WAS DESIROUS
OF BEING ACQUAINTED WITH HER, AND READILY TALKED THEREFORE WHENEVER SHE
COULD THINK OF ANYTHING TO SAY, AND HAD COURAGE AND LEISURE FOR SAYING
IT. BUT THE HINDRANCE THROWN IN THE WAY OF A VERY SPEEDY INTIMACY, BY
THE FREQUENT WANT OF ONE OR MORE OF THESE REQUISITES, PREVENTED THEIR
DOING MORE THAN GOING THROUGH THE FIRST RUDIMENTS OF AN ACQUAINTANCE, BY
INFORMING THEMSELVES HOW WELL THE OTHER LIKED BATH, HOW MUCH SHE ADMIRED
ITS BUILDINGS AND SURROUNDING COUNTRY, WHETHER SHE DREW, OR PLAYED, OR
SANG, AND WHETHER SHE WAS FOND OF RIDING ON HORSEBACK.

THE TWO DANCES WERE SCARCELY CONCLUDED BEFORE CATHERINE FOUND HER ARM
GENTLY SEIZED BY HER FAITHFUL ISABELLA, WHO IN GREAT SPIRITS EXCLAIMED,
"AT LAST I HAVE GOT YOU. MY DEAREST CREATURE, I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR
YOU THIS HOUR. WHAT COULD INDUCE YOU TO COME INTO THIS SET, WHEN YOU
KNEW I WAS IN THE OTHER? I HAVE BEEN QUITE WRETCHED WITHOUT YOU."

"MY DEAR ISABELLA, HOW WAS IT POSSIBLE FOR ME TO GET AT YOU? I COULD NOT
EVEN SEE WHERE YOU WERE."

"SO I TOLD YOUR BROTHER ALL THE TIME--BUT HE WOULD NOT BELIEVE ME. DO GO
AND SEE FOR HER, MR. MORLAND, SAID I--BUT ALL IN VAIN--HE WOULD NOT STIR
AN INCH. WAS NOT IT SO, MR. MORLAND? BUT YOU MEN ARE ALL SO IMMODERATELY
LAZY! I HAVE BEEN SCOLDING HIM TO SUCH A DEGREE, MY DEAR CATHERINE, YOU
WOULD BE QUITE AMAZED. YOU KNOW I NEVER STAND UPON CEREMONY WITH SUCH
PEOPLE."

"LOOK AT THAT YOUNG LADY WITH THE WHITE BEADS ROUND HER HEAD," WHISPERED
CATHERINE, DETACHING HER FRIEND FROM JAMES. "IT IS MR. TILNEY'S SISTER."

"OH! HEAVENS! YOU DON'T SAY SO! LET ME LOOK AT HER THIS MOMENT. WHAT A
DELIGHTFUL GIRL! I NEVER SAW ANYTHING HALF SO BEAUTIFUL! BUT WHERE IS
HER ALL-CONQUERING BROTHER? IS HE IN THE ROOM? POINT HIM OUT TO ME THIS
INSTANT, IF HE IS. I DIE TO SEE HIM. MR. MORLAND, YOU ARE NOT TO LISTEN.
WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT YOU."

"BUT WHAT IS ALL THIS WHISPERING ABOUT? WHAT IS GOING ON?"

"THERE NOW, I KNEW HOW IT WOULD BE. YOU MEN HAVE SUCH RESTLESS
CURIOSITY! TALK OF THE CURIOSITY OF WOMEN, INDEED! 'TIS NOTHING. BUT BE
SATISFIED, FOR YOU ARE NOT TO KNOW ANYTHING AT ALL OF THE MATTER."

"AND IS THAT LIKELY TO SATISFY ME, DO YOU THINK?"

"WELL, I DECLARE I NEVER KNEW ANYTHING LIKE YOU. WHAT CAN IT SIGNIFY TO
YOU, WHAT WE ARE TALKING OF. PERHAPS WE ARE TALKING ABOUT YOU; THEREFORE
I WOULD ADVISE YOU NOT TO LISTEN, OR YOU MAY HAPPEN TO HEAR SOMETHING
NOT VERY AGREEABLE."

IN THIS COMMONPLACE CHATTER, WHICH LASTED SOME TIME, THE ORIGINAL
SUBJECT SEEMED ENTIRELY FORGOTTEN; AND THOUGH CATHERINE WAS VERY WELL
PLEASED TO HAVE IT DROPPED FOR A WHILE, SHE COULD NOT AVOID A LITTLE
SUSPICION AT THE TOTAL SUSPENSION OF ALL ISABELLA'S IMPATIENT DESIRE TO
SEE MR. TILNEY. WHEN THE ORCHESTRA STRUCK UP A FRESH DANCE, JAMES WOULD
HAVE LED HIS FAIR PARTNER AWAY, BUT SHE RESISTED. "I TELL YOU, MR.
MORLAND," SHE CRIED, "I WOULD NOT DO SUCH A THING FOR ALL THE WORLD.
HOW CAN YOU BE SO TEASING; ONLY CONCEIVE, MY DEAR CATHERINE, WHAT YOUR
BROTHER WANTS ME TO DO. HE WANTS ME TO DANCE WITH HIM AGAIN, THOUGH
I TELL HIM THAT IT IS A MOST IMPROPER THING, AND ENTIRELY AGAINST THE
RULES. IT WOULD MAKE US THE TALK OF THE PLACE, IF WE WERE NOT TO CHANGE
PARTNERS."

"UPON MY HONOUR," SAID JAMES, "IN THESE PUBLIC ASSEMBLIES, IT IS AS
OFTEN DONE AS NOT."

"NONSENSE, HOW CAN YOU SAY SO? BUT WHEN YOU MEN HAVE A POINT TO CARRY,
YOU NEVER STICK AT ANYTHING. MY SWEET CATHERINE, DO SUPPORT ME; PERSUADE
YOUR BROTHER HOW IMPOSSIBLE IT IS. TELL HIM THAT IT WOULD QUITE SHOCK
YOU TO SEE ME DO SUCH A THING; NOW WOULD NOT IT?"

"NO, NOT AT ALL; BUT IF YOU THINK IT WRONG, YOU HAD MUCH BETTER CHANGE."

"THERE," CRIED ISABELLA, "YOU HEAR WHAT YOUR SISTER SAYS, AND YET YOU
WILL NOT MIND HER. WELL, REMEMBER THAT IT IS NOT MY FAULT, IF WE SET ALL
THE OLD LADIES IN BATH IN A BUSTLE. COME ALONG, MY DEAREST CATHERINE,
FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE, AND STAND BY ME." AND OFF THEY WENT, TO REGAIN
THEIR FORMER PLACE. JOHN THORPE, IN THE MEANWHILE, HAD WALKED AWAY; AND
CATHERINE, EVER WILLING TO GIVE MR. TILNEY AN OPPORTUNITY OF REPEATING
THE AGREEABLE REQUEST WHICH HAD ALREADY FLATTERED HER ONCE, MADE HER
WAY TO MRS. ALLEN AND MRS. THORPE AS FAST AS SHE COULD, IN THE HOPE
OF FINDING HIM STILL WITH THEM--A HOPE WHICH, WHEN IT PROVED TO BE
FRUITLESS, SHE FELT TO HAVE BEEN HIGHLY UNREASONABLE. "WELL, MY DEAR,"
SAID MRS. THORPE, IMPATIENT FOR PRAISE OF HER SON, "I HOPE YOU HAVE HAD
AN AGREEABLE PARTNER."

"VERY AGREEABLE, MADAM."

"I AM GLAD OF IT. JOHN HAS CHARMING SPIRITS, HAS NOT HE?"

"DID YOU MEET MR. TILNEY, MY DEAR?" SAID MRS. ALLEN.

"NO, WHERE IS HE?"

"HE WAS WITH US JUST NOW, AND SAID HE WAS SO TIRED OF LOUNGING ABOUT,
THAT HE WAS RESOLVED TO GO AND DANCE; SO I THOUGHT PERHAPS HE WOULD ASK
YOU, IF HE MET WITH YOU."

"WHERE CAN HE BE?" SAID CATHERINE, LOOKING ROUND; BUT SHE HAD NOT LOOKED
ROUND LONG BEFORE SHE SAW HIM LEADING A YOUNG LADY TO THE DANCE.

"AH! HE HAS GOT A PARTNER; I WISH HE HAD ASKED YOU," SAID MRS. ALLEN;
AND AFTER A SHORT SILENCE, SHE ADDED, "HE IS A VERY AGREEABLE YOUNG
MAN."

"INDEED HE IS, MRS. ALLEN," SAID MRS. THORPE, SMILING COMPLACENTLY; "I
MUST SAY IT, THOUGH I AM HIS MOTHER, THAT THERE IS NOT A MORE AGREEABLE
YOUNG MAN IN THE WORLD."

THIS INAPPLICABLE ANSWER MIGHT HAVE BEEN TOO MUCH FOR THE COMPREHENSION
OF MANY; BUT IT DID NOT PUZZLE MRS. ALLEN, FOR AFTER ONLY A MOMENT'S
CONSIDERATION, SHE SAID, IN A WHISPER TO CATHERINE, "I DARE SAY SHE
THOUGHT I WAS SPEAKING OF HER SON."

CATHERINE WAS DISAPPOINTED AND VEXED. SHE SEEMED TO HAVE MISSED BY SO
LITTLE THE VERY OBJECT SHE HAD HAD IN VIEW; AND THIS PERSUASION DID NOT
INCLINE HER TO A VERY GRACIOUS REPLY, WHEN JOHN THORPE CAME UP TO HER
SOON AFTERWARDS AND SAID, "WELL, MISS MORLAND, I SUPPOSE YOU AND I ARE
TO STAND UP AND JIG IT TOGETHER AGAIN."

"OH, NO; I AM MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU, OUR TWO DANCES ARE OVER; AND,
BESIDES, I AM TIRED, AND DO NOT MEAN TO DANCE ANY MORE."

"DO NOT YOU? THEN LET US WALK ABOUT AND QUIZ PEOPLE. COME ALONG WITH
ME, AND I WILL SHOW YOU THE FOUR GREATEST QUIZZERS IN THE ROOM; MY TWO
YOUNGER SISTERS AND THEIR PARTNERS. I HAVE BEEN LAUGHING AT THEM THIS
HALF HOUR."

AGAIN CATHERINE EXCUSED HERSELF; AND AT LAST HE WALKED OFF TO QUIZ HIS
SISTERS BY HIMSELF. THE REST OF THE EVENING SHE FOUND VERY DULL; MR.
TILNEY WAS DRAWN AWAY FROM THEIR PARTY AT TEA, TO ATTEND THAT OF HIS
PARTNER; MISS TILNEY, THOUGH BELONGING TO IT, DID NOT SIT NEAR HER, AND
JAMES AND ISABELLA WERE SO MUCH ENGAGED IN CONVERSING TOGETHER THAT THE
LATTER HAD NO LEISURE TO BESTOW MORE ON HER FRIEND THAN ONE SMILE, ONE
SQUEEZE, AND ONE "DEAREST CATHERINE."




CHAPTER 9


THE PROGRESS OF CATHERINE'S UNHAPPINESS FROM THE EVENTS OF THE EVENING
WAS AS FOLLOWS. IT APPEARED FIRST IN A GENERAL DISSATISFACTION WITH
EVERYBODY ABOUT HER, WHILE SHE REMAINED IN THE ROOMS, WHICH SPEEDILY
BROUGHT ON CONSIDERABLE WEARINESS AND A VIOLENT DESIRE TO GO HOME. THIS,
ON ARRIVING IN PULTENEY STREET, TOOK THE DIRECTION OF EXTRAORDINARY
HUNGER, AND WHEN THAT WAS APPEASED, CHANGED INTO AN EARNEST LONGING TO
BE IN BED; SUCH WAS THE EXTREME POINT OF HER DISTRESS; FOR WHEN THERE
SHE IMMEDIATELY FELL INTO A SOUND SLEEP WHICH LASTED NINE HOURS, AND
FROM WHICH SHE AWOKE PERFECTLY REVIVED, IN EXCELLENT SPIRITS, WITH FRESH
HOPES AND FRESH SCHEMES. THE FIRST WISH OF HER HEART WAS TO IMPROVE HER
ACQUAINTANCE WITH MISS TILNEY, AND ALMOST HER FIRST RESOLUTION, TO SEEK
HER FOR THAT PURPOSE, IN THE PUMP-ROOM AT NOON. IN THE PUMP-ROOM, ONE
SO NEWLY ARRIVED IN BATH MUST BE MET WITH, AND THAT BUILDING SHE HAD
ALREADY FOUND SO FAVOURABLE FOR THE DISCOVERY OF FEMALE EXCELLENCE,
AND THE COMPLETION OF FEMALE INTIMACY, SO ADMIRABLY ADAPTED FOR SECRET
DISCOURSES AND UNLIMITED CONFIDENCE, THAT SHE WAS MOST REASONABLY
ENCOURAGED TO EXPECT ANOTHER FRIEND FROM WITHIN ITS WALLS. HER PLAN
FOR THE MORNING THUS SETTLED, SHE SAT QUIETLY DOWN TO HER BOOK AFTER
BREAKFAST, RESOLVING TO REMAIN IN THE SAME PLACE AND THE SAME EMPLOYMENT
TILL THE CLOCK STRUCK ONE; AND FROM HABITUDE VERY LITTLE INCOMMODED BY
THE REMARKS AND EJACULATIONS OF MRS. ALLEN, WHOSE VACANCY OF MIND AND
INCAPACITY FOR THINKING WERE SUCH, THAT AS SHE NEVER TALKED A GREAT
DEAL, SO SHE COULD NEVER BE ENTIRELY SILENT; AND, THEREFORE, WHILE SHE
SAT AT HER WORK, IF SHE LOST HER NEEDLE OR BROKE HER THREAD, IF SHE
HEARD A CARRIAGE IN THE STREET, OR SAW A SPECK UPON HER GOWN, SHE MUST
OBSERVE IT ALOUD, WHETHER THERE WERE ANYONE AT LEISURE TO ANSWER HER OR
NOT. AT ABOUT HALF PAST TWELVE, A REMARKABLY LOUD RAP DREW HER IN HASTE
TO THE WINDOW, AND SCARCELY HAD SHE TIME TO INFORM CATHERINE OF THERE
BEING TWO OPEN CARRIAGES AT THE DOOR, IN THE FIRST ONLY A SERVANT,
HER BROTHER DRIVING MISS THORPE IN THE SECOND, BEFORE JOHN THORPE CAME
RUNNING UPSTAIRS, CALLING OUT, "WELL, MISS MORLAND, HERE I AM. HAVE
YOU BEEN WAITING LONG? WE COULD NOT COME BEFORE; THE OLD DEVIL OF A
COACHMAKER WAS SUCH AN ETERNITY FINDING OUT A THING FIT TO BE GOT INTO,
AND NOW IT IS TEN THOUSAND TO ONE BUT THEY BREAK DOWN BEFORE WE ARE OUT
OF THE STREET. HOW DO YOU DO, MRS. ALLEN? A FAMOUS BALL LAST NIGHT, WAS
NOT IT? COME, MISS MORLAND, BE QUICK, FOR THE OTHERS ARE IN A CONFOUNDED
HURRY TO BE OFF. THEY WANT TO GET THEIR TUMBLE OVER."

"WHAT DO YOU MEAN?" SAID CATHERINE. "WHERE ARE YOU ALL GOING TO?"

"GOING TO? WHY, YOU HAVE NOT FORGOT OUR ENGAGEMENT! DID NOT WE AGREE
TOGETHER TO TAKE A DRIVE THIS MORNING? WHAT A HEAD YOU HAVE! WE ARE
GOING UP CLAVERTON DOWN."

"SOMETHING WAS SAID ABOUT IT, I REMEMBER," SAID CATHERINE, LOOKING AT
MRS. ALLEN FOR HER OPINION; "BUT REALLY I DID NOT EXPECT YOU."

"NOT EXPECT ME! THAT'S A GOOD ONE! AND WHAT A DUST YOU WOULD HAVE MADE,
IF I HAD NOT COME."

CATHERINE'S SILENT APPEAL TO HER FRIEND, MEANWHILE, WAS ENTIRELY THROWN
AWAY, FOR MRS. ALLEN, NOT BEING AT ALL IN THE HABIT OF CONVEYING ANY
EXPRESSION HERSELF BY A LOOK, WAS NOT AWARE OF ITS BEING EVER INTENDED
BY ANYBODY ELSE; AND CATHERINE, WHOSE DESIRE OF SEEING MISS TILNEY AGAIN
COULD AT THAT MOMENT BEAR A SHORT DELAY IN FAVOUR OF A DRIVE, AND WHO
THOUGHT THERE COULD BE NO IMPROPRIETY IN HER GOING WITH MR. THORPE, AS
ISABELLA WAS GOING AT THE SAME TIME WITH JAMES, WAS THEREFORE OBLIGED TO
SPEAK PLAINER. "WELL, MA'AM, WHAT DO YOU SAY TO IT? CAN YOU SPARE ME FOR
AN HOUR OR TWO? SHALL I GO?"

"DO JUST AS YOU PLEASE, MY DEAR," REPLIED MRS. ALLEN, WITH THE MOST
PLACID INDIFFERENCE. CATHERINE TOOK THE ADVICE, AND RAN OFF TO GET
READY. IN A VERY FEW MINUTES SHE REAPPEARED, HAVING SCARCELY ALLOWED
THE TWO OTHERS TIME ENOUGH TO GET THROUGH A FEW SHORT SENTENCES IN HER
PRAISE, AFTER THORPE HAD PROCURED MRS. ALLEN'S ADMIRATION OF HIS GIG;
AND THEN RECEIVING HER FRIEND'S PARTING GOOD WISHES, THEY BOTH HURRIED
DOWNSTAIRS. "MY DEAREST CREATURE," CRIED ISABELLA, TO WHOM THE DUTY
OF FRIENDSHIP IMMEDIATELY CALLED HER BEFORE SHE COULD GET INTO THE
CARRIAGE, "YOU HAVE BEEN AT LEAST THREE HOURS GETTING READY. I WAS
AFRAID YOU WERE ILL. WHAT A DELIGHTFUL BALL WE HAD LAST NIGHT. I HAVE A
THOUSAND THINGS TO SAY TO YOU; BUT MAKE HASTE AND GET IN, FOR I LONG TO
BE OFF."

CATHERINE FOLLOWED HER ORDERS AND TURNED AWAY, BUT NOT TOO SOON TO HEAR
HER FRIEND EXCLAIM ALOUD TO JAMES, "WHAT A SWEET GIRL SHE IS! I QUITE
DOTE ON HER."

"YOU WILL NOT BE FRIGHTENED, MISS MORLAND," SAID THORPE, AS HE HANDED
HER IN, "IF MY HORSE SHOULD DANCE ABOUT A LITTLE AT FIRST SETTING OFF.
HE WILL, MOST LIKELY, GIVE A PLUNGE OR TWO, AND PERHAPS TAKE THE REST
FOR A MINUTE; BUT HE WILL SOON KNOW HIS MASTER. HE IS FULL OF SPIRITS,
PLAYFUL AS CAN BE, BUT THERE IS NO VICE IN HIM."

CATHERINE DID NOT THINK THE PORTRAIT A VERY INVITING ONE, BUT IT WAS TOO
LATE TO RETREAT, AND SHE WAS TOO YOUNG TO OWN HERSELF FRIGHTENED; SO,
RESIGNING HERSELF TO HER FATE, AND TRUSTING TO THE ANIMAL'S BOASTED
KNOWLEDGE OF ITS OWNER, SHE SAT PEACEABLY DOWN, AND SAW THORPE SIT DOWN
BY HER. EVERYTHING BEING THEN ARRANGED, THE SERVANT WHO STOOD AT THE
HORSE'S HEAD WAS BID IN AN IMPORTANT VOICE "TO LET HIM GO," AND OFF THEY
WENT IN THE QUIETEST MANNER IMAGINABLE, WITHOUT A PLUNGE OR A CAPER, OR
ANYTHING LIKE ONE. CATHERINE, DELIGHTED AT SO HAPPY AN ESCAPE, SPOKE
HER PLEASURE ALOUD WITH GRATEFUL SURPRISE; AND HER COMPANION IMMEDIATELY
MADE THE MATTER PERFECTLY SIMPLE BY ASSURING HER THAT IT WAS ENTIRELY
OWING TO THE PECULIARLY JUDICIOUS MANNER IN WHICH HE HAD THEN HELD THE
REINS, AND THE SINGULAR DISCERNMENT AND DEXTERITY WITH WHICH HE HAD
DIRECTED HIS WHIP. CATHERINE, THOUGH SHE COULD NOT HELP WONDERING THAT
WITH SUCH PERFECT COMMAND OF HIS HORSE, HE SHOULD THINK IT NECESSARY TO
ALARM HER WITH A RELATION OF ITS TRICKS, CONGRATULATED HERSELF SINCERELY
ON BEING UNDER THE CARE OF SO EXCELLENT A COACHMAN; AND PERCEIVING THAT
THE ANIMAL CONTINUED TO GO ON IN THE SAME QUIET MANNER, WITHOUT
SHOWING THE SMALLEST PROPENSITY TOWARDS ANY UNPLEASANT VIVACITY, AND
(CONSIDERING ITS INEVITABLE PACE WAS TEN MILES AN HOUR) BY NO MEANS
ALARMINGLY FAST, GAVE HERSELF UP TO ALL THE ENJOYMENT OF AIR AND
EXERCISE OF THE MOST INVIGORATING KIND, IN A FINE MILD DAY OF FEBRUARY,
WITH THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF SAFETY. A SILENCE OF SEVERAL MINUTES SUCCEEDED
THEIR FIRST SHORT DIALOGUE; IT WAS BROKEN BY THORPE'S SAYING VERY
ABRUPTLY, "OLD ALLEN IS AS RICH AS A JEW--IS NOT HE?" CATHERINE DID NOT
UNDERSTAND HIM--AND HE REPEATED HIS QUESTION, ADDING IN EXPLANATION,
"OLD ALLEN, THE MAN YOU ARE WITH."

"OH! MR. ALLEN, YOU MEAN. YES, I BELIEVE, HE IS VERY RICH."

"AND NO CHILDREN AT ALL?"

"NO--NOT ANY."

"A FAMOUS THING FOR HIS NEXT HEIRS. HE IS YOUR GODFATHER, IS NOT HE?"

"MY GODFATHER! NO."

"BUT YOU ARE ALWAYS VERY MUCH WITH THEM."

"YES, VERY MUCH."

"AYE, THAT IS WHAT I MEANT. HE SEEMS A GOOD KIND OF OLD FELLOW ENOUGH,
AND HAS LIVED VERY WELL IN HIS TIME, I DARE SAY; HE IS NOT GOUTY FOR
NOTHING. DOES HE DRINK HIS BOTTLE A DAY NOW?"

"HIS BOTTLE A DAY! NO. WHY SHOULD YOU THINK OF SUCH A THING? HE IS A
VERY TEMPERATE MAN, AND YOU COULD NOT FANCY HIM IN LIQUOR LAST NIGHT?"

"LORD HELP YOU! YOU WOMEN ARE ALWAYS THINKING OF MEN'S BEING IN LIQUOR.
WHY, YOU DO NOT SUPPOSE A MAN IS OVERSET BY A BOTTLE? I AM SURE OF
THIS--THAT IF EVERYBODY WAS TO DRINK THEIR BOTTLE A DAY, THERE WOULD NOT
BE HALF THE DISORDERS IN THE WORLD THERE ARE NOW. IT WOULD BE A FAMOUS
GOOD THING FOR US ALL."

"I CANNOT BELIEVE IT."

"OH! LORD, IT WOULD BE THE SAVING OF THOUSANDS. THERE IS NOT THE
HUNDREDTH PART OF THE WINE CONSUMED IN THIS KINGDOM THAT THERE OUGHT TO
BE. OUR FOGGY CLIMATE WANTS HELP."

"AND YET I HAVE HEARD THAT THERE IS A GREAT DEAL OF WINE DRUNK IN
OXFORD."

"OXFORD! THERE IS NO DRINKING AT OXFORD NOW, I ASSURE YOU. NOBODY DRINKS
THERE. YOU WOULD HARDLY MEET WITH A MAN WHO GOES BEYOND HIS FOUR PINTS
AT THE UTMOST. NOW, FOR INSTANCE, IT WAS RECKONED A REMARKABLE THING, AT
THE LAST PARTY IN MY ROOMS, THAT UPON AN AVERAGE WE CLEARED ABOUT FIVE
PINTS A HEAD. IT WAS LOOKED UPON AS SOMETHING OUT OF THE COMMON WAY.
MINE IS FAMOUS GOOD STUFF, TO BE SURE. YOU WOULD NOT OFTEN MEET WITH
ANYTHING LIKE IT IN OXFORD--AND THAT MAY ACCOUNT FOR IT. BUT THIS WILL
JUST GIVE YOU A NOTION OF THE GENERAL RATE OF DRINKING THERE."

"YES, IT DOES GIVE A NOTION," SAID CATHERINE WARMLY, "AND THAT IS, THAT
YOU ALL DRINK A GREAT DEAL MORE WINE THAN I THOUGHT YOU DID. HOWEVER, I
AM SURE JAMES DOES NOT DRINK SO MUCH."

THIS DECLARATION BROUGHT ON A LOUD AND OVERPOWERING REPLY, OF WHICH
NO PART WAS VERY DISTINCT, EXCEPT THE FREQUENT EXCLAMATIONS, AMOUNTING
ALMOST TO OATHS, WHICH ADORNED IT, AND CATHERINE WAS LEFT, WHEN IT
ENDED, WITH RATHER A STRENGTHENED BELIEF OF THERE BEING A GREAT DEAL
OF WINE DRUNK IN OXFORD, AND THE SAME HAPPY CONVICTION OF HER BROTHER'S
COMPARATIVE SOBRIETY.

THORPE'S IDEAS THEN ALL REVERTED TO THE MERITS OF HIS OWN EQUIPAGE, AND
SHE WAS CALLED ON TO ADMIRE THE SPIRIT AND FREEDOM WITH WHICH HIS HORSE
MOVED ALONG, AND THE EASE WHICH HIS PACES, AS WELL AS THE EXCELLENCE OF
THE SPRINGS, GAVE THE MOTION OF THE CARRIAGE. SHE FOLLOWED HIM IN ALL
HIS ADMIRATION AS WELL AS SHE COULD. TO GO BEFORE OR BEYOND HIM WAS
IMPOSSIBLE. HIS KNOWLEDGE AND HER IGNORANCE OF THE SUBJECT, HIS RAPIDITY
OF EXPRESSION, AND HER DIFFIDENCE OF HERSELF PUT THAT OUT OF HER POWER;
SHE COULD STRIKE OUT NOTHING NEW IN COMMENDATION, BUT SHE READILY ECHOED
WHATEVER HE CHOSE TO ASSERT, AND IT WAS FINALLY SETTLED BETWEEN THEM
WITHOUT ANY DIFFICULTY THAT HIS EQUIPAGE WAS ALTOGETHER THE MOST
COMPLETE OF ITS KIND IN ENGLAND, HIS CARRIAGE THE NEATEST, HIS HORSE THE
BEST GOER, AND HIMSELF THE BEST COACHMAN. "YOU DO NOT REALLY THINK,
MR. THORPE," SAID CATHERINE, VENTURING AFTER SOME TIME TO CONSIDER THE
MATTER AS ENTIRELY DECIDED, AND TO OFFER SOME LITTLE VARIATION ON THE
SUBJECT, "THAT JAMES'S GIG WILL BREAK DOWN?"

"BREAK DOWN! OH! LORD! DID YOU EVER SEE SUCH A LITTLE TITTUPPY THING IN
YOUR LIFE? THERE IS NOT A SOUND PIECE OF IRON ABOUT IT. THE WHEELS HAVE
BEEN FAIRLY WORN OUT THESE TEN YEARS AT LEAST--AND AS FOR THE BODY! UPON
MY SOUL, YOU MIGHT SHAKE IT TO PIECES YOURSELF WITH A TOUCH. IT IS THE
MOST DEVILISH LITTLE RICKETY BUSINESS I EVER BEHELD! THANK GOD! WE
HAVE GOT A BETTER. I WOULD NOT BE BOUND TO GO TWO MILES IN IT FOR FIFTY
THOUSAND POUNDS."

"GOOD HEAVENS!" CRIED CATHERINE, QUITE FRIGHTENED. "THEN PRAY LET US
TURN BACK; THEY WILL CERTAINLY MEET WITH AN ACCIDENT IF WE GO ON. DO LET
US TURN BACK, MR. THORPE; STOP AND SPEAK TO MY BROTHER, AND TELL HIM HOW
VERY UNSAFE IT IS."

"UNSAFE! OH, LORD! WHAT IS THERE IN THAT? THEY WILL ONLY GET A ROLL IF
IT DOES BREAK DOWN; AND THERE IS PLENTY OF DIRT; IT WILL BE EXCELLENT
FALLING. OH, CURSE IT! THE CARRIAGE IS SAFE ENOUGH, IF A MAN KNOWS HOW
TO DRIVE IT; A THING OF THAT SORT IN GOOD HANDS WILL LAST ABOVE TWENTY
YEARS AFTER IT IS FAIRLY WORN OUT. LORD BLESS YOU! I WOULD UNDERTAKE FOR
FIVE POUNDS TO DRIVE IT TO YORK AND BACK AGAIN, WITHOUT LOSING A NAIL."

CATHERINE LISTENED WITH ASTONISHMENT; SHE KNEW NOT HOW TO RECONCILE TWO
SUCH VERY DIFFERENT ACCOUNTS OF THE SAME THING; FOR SHE HAD NOT BEEN
BROUGHT UP TO UNDERSTAND THE PROPENSITIES OF A RATTLE, NOR TO KNOW TO
HOW MANY IDLE ASSERTIONS AND IMPUDENT FALSEHOODS THE EXCESS OF VANITY
WILL LEAD. HER OWN FAMILY WERE PLAIN, MATTER-OF-FACT PEOPLE WHO SELDOM
AIMED AT WIT OF ANY KIND; HER FATHER, AT THE UTMOST, BEING CONTENTED
WITH A PUN, AND HER MOTHER WITH A PROVERB; THEY WERE NOT IN THE HABIT
THEREFORE OF TELLING LIES TO INCREASE THEIR IMPORTANCE, OR OF ASSERTING
AT ONE MOMENT WHAT THEY WOULD CONTRADICT THE NEXT. SHE REFLECTED ON THE
AFFAIR FOR SOME TIME IN MUCH PERPLEXITY, AND WAS MORE THAN ONCE ON THE
POINT OF REQUESTING FROM MR. THORPE A CLEARER INSIGHT INTO HIS REAL
OPINION ON THE SUBJECT; BUT SHE CHECKED HERSELF, BECAUSE IT APPEARED TO
HER THAT HE DID NOT EXCEL IN GIVING THOSE CLEARER INSIGHTS, IN MAKING
THOSE THINGS PLAIN WHICH HE HAD BEFORE MADE AMBIGUOUS; AND, JOINING TO
THIS, THE CONSIDERATION THAT HE WOULD NOT REALLY SUFFER HIS SISTER AND
HIS FRIEND TO BE EXPOSED TO A DANGER FROM WHICH HE MIGHT EASILY PRESERVE
THEM, SHE CONCLUDED AT LAST THAT HE MUST KNOW THE CARRIAGE TO BE IN FACT
PERFECTLY SAFE, AND THEREFORE WOULD ALARM HERSELF NO LONGER. BY HIM
THE WHOLE MATTER SEEMED ENTIRELY FORGOTTEN; AND ALL THE REST OF HIS
CONVERSATION, OR RATHER TALK, BEGAN AND ENDED WITH HIMSELF AND HIS OWN
CONCERNS. HE TOLD HER OF HORSES WHICH HE HAD BOUGHT FOR A TRIFLE AND
SOLD FOR INCREDIBLE SUMS; OF RACING MATCHES, IN WHICH HIS JUDGMENT HAD
INFALLIBLY FORETOLD THE WINNER; OF SHOOTING PARTIES, IN WHICH HE HAD
KILLED MORE BIRDS (THOUGH WITHOUT HAVING ONE GOOD SHOT) THAN ALL HIS
COMPANIONS TOGETHER; AND DESCRIBED TO HER SOME FAMOUS DAY'S SPORT, WITH
THE FOX-HOUNDS, IN WHICH HIS FORESIGHT AND SKILL IN DIRECTING THE DOGS
HAD REPAIRED THE MISTAKES OF THE MOST EXPERIENCED HUNTSMAN, AND IN WHICH
THE BOLDNESS OF HIS RIDING, THOUGH IT HAD NEVER ENDANGERED HIS OWN LIFE
FOR A MOMENT, HAD BEEN CONSTANTLY LEADING OTHERS INTO DIFFICULTIES,
WHICH HE CALMLY CONCLUDED HAD BROKEN THE NECKS OF MANY.

LITTLE AS CATHERINE WAS IN THE HABIT OF JUDGING FOR HERSELF, AND UNFIXED
AS WERE HER GENERAL NOTIONS OF WHAT MEN OUGHT TO BE, SHE COULD NOT
ENTIRELY REPRESS A DOUBT, WHILE SHE BORE WITH THE EFFUSIONS OF HIS
ENDLESS CONCEIT, OF HIS BEING ALTOGETHER COMPLETELY AGREEABLE. IT WAS A
BOLD SURMISE, FOR HE WAS ISABELLA'S BROTHER; AND SHE HAD BEEN ASSURED BY
JAMES THAT HIS MANNERS WOULD RECOMMEND HIM TO ALL HER SEX; BUT IN SPITE
OF THIS, THE EXTREME WEARINESS OF HIS COMPANY, WHICH CREPT OVER HER
BEFORE THEY HAD BEEN OUT AN HOUR, AND WHICH CONTINUED UNCEASINGLY TO
INCREASE TILL THEY STOPPED IN PULTENEY STREET AGAIN, INDUCED HER, IN
SOME SMALL DEGREE, TO RESIST SUCH HIGH AUTHORITY, AND TO DISTRUST HIS
POWERS OF GIVING UNIVERSAL PLEASURE.

WHEN THEY ARRIVED AT MRS. ALLEN'S DOOR, THE ASTONISHMENT OF ISABELLA WAS
HARDLY TO BE EXPRESSED, ON FINDING THAT IT WAS TOO LATE IN THE DAY FOR
THEM TO ATTEND HER FRIEND INTO THE HOUSE: "PAST THREE O'CLOCK!" IT WAS
INCONCEIVABLE, INCREDIBLE, IMPOSSIBLE! AND SHE WOULD NEITHER BELIEVE HER
OWN WATCH, NOR HER BROTHER'S, NOR THE SERVANT'S; SHE WOULD BELIEVE NO
ASSURANCE OF IT FOUNDED ON REASON OR REALITY, TILL MORLAND PRODUCED HIS
WATCH, AND ASCERTAINED THE FACT; TO HAVE DOUBTED A MOMENT LONGER THEN
WOULD HAVE BEEN EQUALLY INCONCEIVABLE, INCREDIBLE, AND IMPOSSIBLE; AND
SHE COULD ONLY PROTEST, OVER AND OVER AGAIN, THAT NO TWO HOURS AND A
HALF HAD EVER GONE OFF SO SWIFTLY BEFORE, AS CATHERINE WAS CALLED ON TO
CONFIRM; CATHERINE COULD NOT TELL A FALSEHOOD EVEN TO PLEASE ISABELLA;
BUT THE LATTER WAS SPARED THE MISERY OF HER FRIEND'S DISSENTING VOICE,
BY NOT WAITING FOR HER ANSWER. HER OWN FEELINGS ENTIRELY ENGROSSED
HER; HER WRETCHEDNESS WAS MOST ACUTE ON FINDING HERSELF OBLIGED TO GO
DIRECTLY HOME. IT WAS AGES SINCE SHE HAD HAD A MOMENT'S CONVERSATION
WITH HER DEAREST CATHERINE; AND, THOUGH SHE HAD SUCH THOUSANDS OF THINGS
TO SAY TO HER, IT APPEARED AS IF THEY WERE NEVER TO BE TOGETHER AGAIN;
SO, WITH SMILES OF MOST EXQUISITE MISERY, AND THE LAUGHING EYE OF UTTER
DESPONDENCY, SHE BADE HER FRIEND ADIEU AND WENT ON.

CATHERINE FOUND MRS. ALLEN JUST RETURNED FROM ALL THE BUSY IDLENESS OF
THE MORNING, AND WAS IMMEDIATELY GREETED WITH, "WELL, MY DEAR, HERE
YOU ARE," A TRUTH WHICH SHE HAD NO GREATER INCLINATION THAN POWER TO
DISPUTE; "AND I HOPE YOU HAVE HAD A PLEASANT AIRING?"

"YES, MA'AM, I THANK YOU; WE COULD NOT HAVE HAD A NICER DAY."

"SO MRS. THORPE SAID; SHE WAS VASTLY PLEASED AT YOUR ALL GOING."

"YOU HAVE SEEN MRS. THORPE, THEN?"

"YES, I WENT TO THE PUMP-ROOM AS SOON AS YOU WERE GONE, AND THERE I MET
HER, AND WE HAD A GREAT DEAL OF TALK TOGETHER. SHE SAYS THERE WAS HARDLY
ANY VEAL TO BE GOT AT MARKET THIS MORNING, IT IS SO UNCOMMONLY SCARCE."

"DID YOU SEE ANYBODY ELSE OF OUR ACQUAINTANCE?"

"YES; WE AGREED TO TAKE A TURN IN THE CRESCENT, AND THERE WE MET MRS.
HUGHES, AND MR. AND MISS TILNEY WALKING WITH HER."

"DID YOU INDEED? AND DID THEY SPEAK TO YOU?"

"YES, WE WALKED ALONG THE CRESCENT TOGETHER FOR HALF AN HOUR. THEY SEEM
VERY AGREEABLE PEOPLE. MISS TILNEY WAS IN A VERY PRETTY SPOTTED
MUSLIN, AND I FANCY, BY WHAT I CAN LEARN, THAT SHE ALWAYS DRESSES VERY
HANDSOMELY. MRS. HUGHES TALKED TO ME A GREAT DEAL ABOUT THE FAMILY."

"AND WHAT DID SHE TELL YOU OF THEM?"

"OH! A VAST DEAL INDEED; SHE HARDLY TALKED OF ANYTHING ELSE."

"DID SHE TELL YOU WHAT PART OF GLOUCESTERSHIRE THEY COME FROM?"

"YES, SHE DID; BUT I CANNOT RECOLLECT NOW. BUT THEY ARE VERY GOOD KIND
OF PEOPLE, AND VERY RICH. MRS. TILNEY WAS A MISS DRUMMOND, AND SHE
AND MRS. HUGHES WERE SCHOOLFELLOWS; AND MISS DRUMMOND HAD A VERY LARGE
FORTUNE; AND, WHEN SHE MARRIED, HER FATHER GAVE HER TWENTY THOUSAND
POUNDS, AND FIVE HUNDRED TO BUY WEDDING-CLOTHES. MRS. HUGHES SAW ALL THE
CLOTHES AFTER THEY CAME FROM THE WAREHOUSE."

"AND ARE MR. AND MRS. TILNEY IN BATH?"

"YES, I FANCY THEY ARE, BUT I AM NOT QUITE CERTAIN. UPON RECOLLECTION,
HOWEVER, I HAVE A NOTION THEY ARE BOTH DEAD; AT LEAST THE MOTHER IS;
YES, I AM SURE MRS. TILNEY IS DEAD, BECAUSE MRS. HUGHES TOLD ME THERE
WAS A VERY BEAUTIFUL SET OF PEARLS THAT MR. DRUMMOND GAVE HIS DAUGHTER
ON HER WEDDING-DAY AND THAT MISS TILNEY HAS GOT NOW, FOR THEY WERE PUT
BY FOR HER WHEN HER MOTHER DIED."

"AND IS MR. TILNEY, MY PARTNER, THE ONLY SON?"

"I CANNOT BE QUITE POSITIVE ABOUT THAT, MY DEAR; I HAVE SOME IDEA HE IS;
BUT, HOWEVER, HE IS A VERY FINE YOUNG MAN, MRS. HUGHES SAYS, AND LIKELY
TO DO VERY WELL."

CATHERINE INQUIRED NO FURTHER; SHE HAD HEARD ENOUGH TO FEEL THAT
MRS. ALLEN HAD NO REAL INTELLIGENCE TO GIVE, AND THAT SHE WAS MOST
PARTICULARLY UNFORTUNATE HERSELF IN HAVING MISSED SUCH A MEETING WITH
BOTH BROTHER AND SISTER. COULD SHE HAVE FORESEEN SUCH A CIRCUMSTANCE,
NOTHING SHOULD HAVE PERSUADED HER TO GO OUT WITH THE OTHERS; AND, AS
IT WAS, SHE COULD ONLY LAMENT HER ILL LUCK, AND THINK OVER WHAT SHE HAD
LOST, TILL IT WAS CLEAR TO HER THAT THE DRIVE HAD BY NO MEANS BEEN VERY
PLEASANT AND THAT JOHN THORPE HIMSELF WAS QUITE DISAGREEABLE.




CHAPTER 10


THE ALLENS, THORPES, AND MORLANDS ALL MET IN THE EVENING AT THE
THEATRE; AND, AS CATHERINE AND ISABELLA SAT TOGETHER, THERE WAS THEN AN
OPPORTUNITY FOR THE LATTER TO UTTER SOME FEW OF THE MANY THOUSAND
THINGS WHICH HAD BEEN COLLECTING WITHIN HER FOR COMMUNICATION IN THE
IMMEASURABLE LENGTH OF TIME WHICH HAD DIVIDED THEM. "OH, HEAVENS!
MY BELOVED CATHERINE, HAVE I GOT YOU AT LAST?" WAS HER ADDRESS ON
CATHERINE'S ENTERING THE BOX AND SITTING BY HER. "NOW, MR. MORLAND," FOR
HE WAS CLOSE TO HER ON THE OTHER SIDE, "I SHALL NOT SPEAK ANOTHER WORD
TO YOU ALL THE REST OF THE EVENING; SO I CHARGE YOU NOT TO EXPECT IT. MY
SWEETEST CATHERINE, HOW HAVE YOU BEEN THIS LONG AGE? BUT I NEED NOT ASK
YOU, FOR YOU LOOK DELIGHTFULLY. YOU REALLY HAVE DONE YOUR HAIR IN A
MORE HEAVENLY STYLE THAN EVER; YOU MISCHIEVOUS CREATURE, DO YOU WANT TO
ATTRACT EVERYBODY? I ASSURE YOU, MY BROTHER IS QUITE IN LOVE WITH YOU
ALREADY; AND AS FOR MR. TILNEY--BUT THAT IS A SETTLED THING--EVEN YOUR
MODESTY CANNOT DOUBT HIS ATTACHMENT NOW; HIS COMING BACK TO BATH MAKES
IT TOO PLAIN. OH! WHAT WOULD NOT I GIVE TO SEE HIM! I REALLY AM QUITE
WILD WITH IMPATIENCE. MY MOTHER SAYS HE IS THE MOST DELIGHTFUL YOUNG MAN
IN THE WORLD; SHE SAW HIM THIS MORNING, YOU KNOW; YOU MUST INTRODUCE HIM
TO ME. IS HE IN THE HOUSE NOW? LOOK ABOUT, FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE! I ASSURE
YOU, I CAN HARDLY EXIST TILL I SEE HIM."

"NO," SAID CATHERINE, "HE IS NOT HERE; I CANNOT SEE HIM ANYWHERE."

"OH, HORRID! AM I NEVER TO BE ACQUAINTED WITH HIM? HOW DO YOU LIKE MY
GOWN? I THINK IT DOES NOT LOOK AMISS; THE SLEEVES WERE ENTIRELY MY OWN
THOUGHT. DO YOU KNOW, I GET SO IMMODERATELY SICK OF BATH; YOUR BROTHER
AND I WERE AGREEING THIS MORNING THAT, THOUGH IT IS VASTLY WELL TO BE
HERE FOR A FEW WEEKS, WE WOULD NOT LIVE HERE FOR MILLIONS. WE SOON FOUND
OUT THAT OUR TASTES WERE EXACTLY ALIKE IN PREFERRING THE COUNTRY TO
EVERY OTHER PLACE; REALLY, OUR OPINIONS WERE SO EXACTLY THE SAME, IT WAS
QUITE RIDICULOUS! THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE POINT IN WHICH WE DIFFERED; I
WOULD NOT HAVE HAD YOU BY FOR THE WORLD; YOU ARE SUCH A SLY THING, I AM
SURE YOU WOULD HAVE MADE SOME DROLL REMARK OR OTHER ABOUT IT."

"NO, INDEED I SHOULD NOT."

"OH, YES YOU WOULD INDEED; I KNOW YOU BETTER THAN YOU KNOW YOURSELF. YOU
WOULD HAVE TOLD US THAT WE SEEMED BORN FOR EACH OTHER, OR SOME NONSENSE
OF THAT KIND, WHICH WOULD HAVE DISTRESSED ME BEYOND CONCEPTION; MY
CHEEKS WOULD HAVE BEEN AS RED AS YOUR ROSES; I WOULD NOT HAVE HAD YOU BY
FOR THE WORLD."

"INDEED YOU DO ME INJUSTICE; I WOULD NOT HAVE MADE SO IMPROPER A REMARK
UPON ANY ACCOUNT; AND BESIDES, I AM SURE IT WOULD NEVER HAVE ENTERED MY
HEAD."

ISABELLA SMILED INCREDULOUSLY AND TALKED THE REST OF THE EVENING TO
JAMES.

CATHERINE'S RESOLUTION OF ENDEAVOURING TO MEET MISS TILNEY AGAIN
CONTINUED IN FULL FORCE THE NEXT MORNING; AND TILL THE USUAL MOMENT OF
GOING TO THE PUMP-ROOM, SHE FELT SOME ALARM FROM THE DREAD OF A SECOND
PREVENTION. BUT NOTHING OF THAT KIND OCCURRED, NO VISITORS APPEARED TO
DELAY THEM, AND THEY ALL THREE SET OFF IN GOOD TIME FOR THE PUMP-ROOM,
WHERE THE ORDINARY COURSE OF EVENTS AND CONVERSATION TOOK PLACE; MR.
ALLEN, AFTER DRINKING HIS GLASS OF WATER, JOINED SOME GENTLEMEN TO
TALK OVER THE POLITICS OF THE DAY AND COMPARE THE ACCOUNTS OF THEIR
NEWSPAPERS; AND THE LADIES WALKED ABOUT TOGETHER, NOTICING EVERY NEW
FACE, AND ALMOST EVERY NEW BONNET IN THE ROOM. THE FEMALE PART OF THE
THORPE FAMILY, ATTENDED BY JAMES MORLAND, APPEARED AMONG THE CROWD IN
LESS THAN A QUARTER OF AN HOUR, AND CATHERINE IMMEDIATELY TOOK HER
USUAL PLACE BY THE SIDE OF HER FRIEND. JAMES, WHO WAS NOW IN CONSTANT
ATTENDANCE, MAINTAINED A SIMILAR POSITION, AND SEPARATING THEMSELVES
FROM THE REST OF THEIR PARTY, THEY WALKED IN THAT MANNER FOR SOME
TIME, TILL CATHERINE BEGAN TO DOUBT THE HAPPINESS OF A SITUATION WHICH,
CONFINING HER ENTIRELY TO HER FRIEND AND BROTHER, GAVE HER VERY
LITTLE SHARE IN THE NOTICE OF EITHER. THEY WERE ALWAYS ENGAGED IN
SOME SENTIMENTAL DISCUSSION OR LIVELY DISPUTE, BUT THEIR SENTIMENT WAS
CONVEYED IN SUCH WHISPERING VOICES, AND THEIR VIVACITY ATTENDED WITH
SO MUCH LAUGHTER, THAT THOUGH CATHERINE'S SUPPORTING OPINION WAS NOT
UNFREQUENTLY CALLED FOR BY ONE OR THE OTHER, SHE WAS NEVER ABLE TO GIVE
ANY, FROM NOT HAVING HEARD A WORD OF THE SUBJECT. AT LENGTH HOWEVER
SHE WAS EMPOWERED TO DISENGAGE HERSELF FROM HER FRIEND, BY THE AVOWED
NECESSITY OF SPEAKING TO MISS TILNEY, WHOM SHE MOST JOYFULLY SAW JUST
ENTERING THE ROOM WITH MRS. HUGHES, AND WHOM SHE INSTANTLY JOINED, WITH
A FIRMER DETERMINATION TO BE ACQUAINTED, THAN SHE MIGHT HAVE HAD COURAGE
TO COMMAND, HAD SHE NOT BEEN URGED BY THE DISAPPOINTMENT OF THE DAY
BEFORE. MISS TILNEY MET HER WITH GREAT CIVILITY, RETURNED HER ADVANCES
WITH EQUAL GOODWILL, AND THEY CONTINUED TALKING TOGETHER AS LONG AS
BOTH PARTIES REMAINED IN THE ROOM; AND THOUGH IN ALL PROBABILITY NOT
AN OBSERVATION WAS MADE, NOR AN EXPRESSION USED BY EITHER WHICH HAD NOT
BEEN MADE AND USED SOME THOUSANDS OF TIMES BEFORE, UNDER THAT ROOF, IN
EVERY BATH SEASON, YET THE MERIT OF THEIR BEING SPOKEN WITH SIMPLICITY
AND TRUTH, AND WITHOUT PERSONAL CONCEIT, MIGHT BE SOMETHING UNCOMMON.

"HOW WELL YOUR BROTHER DANCES!" WAS AN ARTLESS EXCLAMATION OF
CATHERINE'S TOWARDS THE CLOSE OF THEIR CONVERSATION, WHICH AT ONCE
SURPRISED AND AMUSED HER COMPANION.

"HENRY!" SHE REPLIED WITH A SMILE. "YES, HE DOES DANCE VERY WELL."

"HE MUST HAVE THOUGHT IT VERY ODD TO HEAR ME SAY I WAS ENGAGED THE OTHER
EVENING, WHEN HE SAW ME SITTING DOWN. BUT I REALLY HAD BEEN ENGAGED
THE WHOLE DAY TO MR. THORPE." MISS TILNEY COULD ONLY BOW. "YOU CANNOT
THINK," ADDED CATHERINE AFTER A MOMENT'S SILENCE, "HOW SURPRISED I WAS
TO SEE HIM AGAIN. I FELT SO SURE OF HIS BEING QUITE GONE AWAY."

"WHEN HENRY HAD THE PLEASURE OF SEEING YOU BEFORE, HE WAS IN BATH BUT
FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS. HE CAME ONLY TO ENGAGE LODGINGS FOR US."

"THAT NEVER OCCURRED TO ME; AND OF COURSE, NOT SEEING HIM ANYWHERE, I
THOUGHT HE MUST BE GONE. WAS NOT THE YOUNG LADY HE DANCED WITH ON MONDAY
A MISS SMITH?"

"YES, AN ACQUAINTANCE OF MRS. HUGHES."

"I DARE SAY SHE WAS VERY GLAD TO DANCE. DO YOU THINK HER PRETTY?"

"NOT VERY."

"HE NEVER COMES TO THE PUMP-ROOM, I SUPPOSE?"

"YES, SOMETIMES; BUT HE HAS RID OUT THIS MORNING WITH MY FATHER."

MRS. HUGHES NOW JOINED THEM, AND ASKED MISS TILNEY IF SHE WAS READY TO
GO. "I HOPE I SHALL HAVE THE PLEASURE OF SEEING YOU AGAIN SOON," SAID
CATHERINE. "SHALL YOU BE AT THE COTILLION BALL TOMORROW?"

"PERHAPS WE--YES, I THINK WE CERTAINLY SHALL."

"I AM GLAD OF IT, FOR WE SHALL ALL BE THERE." THIS CIVILITY WAS DULY
RETURNED; AND THEY PARTED--ON MISS TILNEY'S SIDE WITH SOME KNOWLEDGE
OF HER NEW ACQUAINTANCE'S FEELINGS, AND ON CATHERINE'S, WITHOUT THE
SMALLEST CONSCIOUSNESS OF HAVING EXPLAINED THEM.

SHE WENT HOME VERY HAPPY. THE MORNING HAD ANSWERED ALL HER HOPES, AND
THE EVENING OF THE FOLLOWING DAY WAS NOW THE OBJECT OF EXPECTATION,
THE FUTURE GOOD. WHAT GOWN AND WHAT HEAD-DRESS SHE SHOULD WEAR ON THE
OCCASION BECAME HER CHIEF CONCERN. SHE CANNOT BE JUSTIFIED IN IT. DRESS
IS AT ALL TIMES A FRIVOLOUS DISTINCTION, AND EXCESSIVE SOLICITUDE ABOUT
IT OFTEN DESTROYS ITS OWN AIM. CATHERINE KNEW ALL THIS VERY WELL; HER
GREAT AUNT HAD READ HER A LECTURE ON THE SUBJECT ONLY THE CHRISTMAS
BEFORE; AND YET SHE LAY AWAKE TEN MINUTES ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT DEBATING
BETWEEN HER SPOTTED AND HER TAMBOURED MUSLIN, AND NOTHING BUT THE
SHORTNESS OF THE TIME PREVENTED HER BUYING A NEW ONE FOR THE EVENING.
THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN AN ERROR IN JUDGMENT, GREAT THOUGH NOT UNCOMMON,
FROM WHICH ONE OF THE OTHER SEX RATHER THAN HER OWN, A BROTHER RATHER
THAN A GREAT AUNT, MIGHT HAVE WARNED HER, FOR MAN ONLY CAN BE AWARE OF
THE INSENSIBILITY OF MAN TOWARDS A NEW GOWN. IT WOULD BE MORTIFYING TO
THE FEELINGS OF MANY LADIES, COULD THEY BE MADE TO UNDERSTAND HOW LITTLE
THE HEART OF MAN IS AFFECTED BY WHAT IS COSTLY OR NEW IN THEIR ATTIRE;
HOW LITTLE IT IS BIASED BY THE TEXTURE OF THEIR MUSLIN, AND HOW
UNSUSCEPTIBLE OF PECULIAR TENDERNESS TOWARDS THE SPOTTED, THE SPRIGGED,
THE MULL, OR THE JACKONET. WOMAN IS FINE FOR HER OWN SATISFACTION ALONE.
NO MAN WILL ADMIRE HER THE MORE, NO WOMAN WILL LIKE HER THE BETTER FOR
IT. NEATNESS AND FASHION ARE ENOUGH FOR THE FORMER, AND A SOMETHING OF
SHABBINESS OR IMPROPRIETY WILL BE MOST ENDEARING TO THE LATTER. BUT NOT
ONE OF THESE GRAVE REFLECTIONS TROUBLED THE TRANQUILLITY OF CATHERINE.

SHE ENTERED THE ROOMS ON THURSDAY EVENING WITH FEELINGS VERY DIFFERENT
FROM WHAT HAD ATTENDED HER THITHER THE MONDAY BEFORE. SHE HAD THEN BEEN
EXULTING IN HER ENGAGEMENT TO THORPE, AND WAS NOW CHIEFLY ANXIOUS TO
AVOID HIS SIGHT, LEST HE SHOULD ENGAGE HER AGAIN; FOR THOUGH SHE COULD
NOT, DARED NOT EXPECT THAT MR. TILNEY SHOULD ASK HER A THIRD TIME TO
DANCE, HER WISHES, HOPES, AND PLANS ALL CENTRED IN NOTHING LESS. EVERY
YOUNG LADY MAY FEEL FOR MY HEROINE IN THIS CRITICAL MOMENT, FOR EVERY
YOUNG LADY HAS AT SOME TIME OR OTHER KNOWN THE SAME AGITATION. ALL HAVE
BEEN, OR AT LEAST ALL HAVE BELIEVED THEMSELVES TO BE, IN DANGER FROM THE
PURSUIT OF SOMEONE WHOM THEY WISHED TO AVOID; AND ALL HAVE BEEN ANXIOUS
FOR THE ATTENTIONS OF SOMEONE WHOM THEY WISHED TO PLEASE. AS SOON AS
THEY WERE JOINED BY THE THORPES, CATHERINE'S AGONY BEGAN; SHE FIDGETED
ABOUT IF JOHN THORPE CAME TOWARDS HER, HID HERSELF AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE
FROM HIS VIEW, AND WHEN HE SPOKE TO HER PRETENDED NOT TO HEAR HIM. THE
COTILLIONS WERE OVER, THE COUNTRY-DANCING BEGINNING, AND SHE SAW NOTHING
OF THE TILNEYS.

"DO NOT BE FRIGHTENED, MY DEAR CATHERINE," WHISPERED ISABELLA, "BUT I AM
REALLY GOING TO DANCE WITH YOUR BROTHER AGAIN. I DECLARE POSITIVELY IT
IS QUITE SHOCKING. I TELL HIM HE OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED OF HIMSELF, BUT YOU
AND JOHN MUST KEEP US IN COUNTENANCE. MAKE HASTE, MY DEAR CREATURE, AND
COME TO US. JOHN IS JUST WALKED OFF, BUT HE WILL BE BACK IN A MOMENT."

CATHERINE HAD NEITHER TIME NOR INCLINATION TO ANSWER. THE OTHERS WALKED
AWAY, JOHN THORPE WAS STILL IN VIEW, AND SHE GAVE HERSELF UP FOR LOST.
THAT SHE MIGHT NOT APPEAR, HOWEVER, TO OBSERVE OR EXPECT HIM, SHE KEPT
HER EYES INTENTLY FIXED ON HER FAN; AND A SELF-CONDEMNATION FOR HER
FOLLY, IN SUPPOSING THAT AMONG SUCH A CROWD THEY SHOULD EVEN MEET WITH
THE TILNEYS IN ANY REASONABLE TIME, HAD JUST PASSED THROUGH HER MIND,
WHEN SHE SUDDENLY FOUND HERSELF ADDRESSED AND AGAIN SOLICITED TO DANCE,
BY MR. TILNEY HIMSELF. WITH WHAT SPARKLING EYES AND READY MOTION SHE
GRANTED HIS REQUEST, AND WITH HOW PLEASING A FLUTTER OF HEART SHE WENT
WITH HIM TO THE SET, MAY BE EASILY IMAGINED. TO ESCAPE, AND, AS
SHE BELIEVED, SO NARROWLY ESCAPE JOHN THORPE, AND TO BE ASKED, SO
IMMEDIATELY ON HIS JOINING HER, ASKED BY MR. TILNEY, AS IF HE HAD SOUGHT
HER ON PURPOSE!--IT DID NOT APPEAR TO HER THAT LIFE COULD SUPPLY ANY
GREATER FELICITY.

SCARCELY HAD THEY WORKED THEMSELVES INTO THE QUIET POSSESSION OF A
PLACE, HOWEVER, WHEN HER ATTENTION WAS CLAIMED BY JOHN THORPE, WHO STOOD
BEHIND HER. "HEYDAY, MISS MORLAND!" SAID HE. "WHAT IS THE MEANING OF
THIS? I THOUGHT YOU AND I WERE TO DANCE TOGETHER."

"I WONDER YOU SHOULD THINK SO, FOR YOU NEVER ASKED ME."

"THAT IS A GOOD ONE, BY JOVE! I ASKED YOU AS SOON AS I CAME INTO THE
ROOM, AND I WAS JUST GOING TO ASK YOU AGAIN, BUT WHEN I TURNED ROUND,
YOU WERE GONE! THIS IS A CURSED SHABBY TRICK! I ONLY CAME FOR THE SAKE
OF DANCING WITH YOU, AND I FIRMLY BELIEVE YOU WERE ENGAGED TO ME EVER
SINCE MONDAY. YES; I REMEMBER, I ASKED YOU WHILE YOU WERE WAITING IN THE
LOBBY FOR YOUR CLOAK. AND HERE HAVE I BEEN TELLING ALL MY ACQUAINTANCE
THAT I WAS GOING TO DANCE WITH THE PRETTIEST GIRL IN THE ROOM; AND
WHEN THEY SEE YOU STANDING UP WITH SOMEBODY ELSE, THEY WILL QUIZ ME
FAMOUSLY."

"OH, NO; THEY WILL NEVER THINK OF ME, AFTER SUCH A DESCRIPTION AS THAT."

"BY HEAVENS, IF THEY DO NOT, I WILL KICK THEM OUT OF THE ROOM FOR
BLOCKHEADS. WHAT CHAP HAVE YOU THERE?" CATHERINE SATISFIED HIS
CURIOSITY. "TILNEY," HE REPEATED. "HUM--I DO NOT KNOW HIM. A GOOD FIGURE
OF A MAN; WELL PUT TOGETHER. DOES HE WANT A HORSE? HERE IS A FRIEND
OF MINE, SAM FLETCHER, HAS GOT ONE TO SELL THAT WOULD SUIT ANYBODY. A
FAMOUS CLEVER ANIMAL FOR THE ROAD--ONLY FORTY GUINEAS. I HAD FIFTY MINDS
TO BUY IT MYSELF, FOR IT IS ONE OF MY MAXIMS ALWAYS TO BUY A GOOD HORSE
WHEN I MEET WITH ONE; BUT IT WOULD NOT ANSWER MY PURPOSE, IT WOULD NOT
DO FOR THE FIELD. I WOULD GIVE ANY MONEY FOR A REAL GOOD HUNTER. I
HAVE THREE NOW, THE BEST THAT EVER WERE BACKED. I WOULD NOT TAKE
EIGHT HUNDRED GUINEAS FOR THEM. FLETCHER AND I MEAN TO GET A HOUSE IN
LEICESTERSHIRE, AGAINST THE NEXT SEASON. IT IS SO D--UNCOMFORTABLE,
LIVING AT AN INN."

THIS WAS THE LAST SENTENCE BY WHICH HE COULD WEARY CATHERINE'S
ATTENTION, FOR HE WAS JUST THEN BORNE OFF BY THE RESISTLESS PRESSURE OF
A LONG STRING OF PASSING LADIES. HER PARTNER NOW DREW NEAR, AND SAID,
"THAT GENTLEMAN WOULD HAVE PUT ME OUT OF PATIENCE, HAD HE STAYED WITH
YOU HALF A MINUTE LONGER. HE HAS NO BUSINESS TO WITHDRAW THE ATTENTION
OF MY PARTNER FROM ME. WE HAVE ENTERED INTO A CONTRACT OF MUTUAL
AGREEABLENESS FOR THE SPACE OF AN EVENING, AND ALL OUR AGREEABLENESS
BELONGS SOLELY TO EACH OTHER FOR THAT TIME. NOBODY CAN FASTEN THEMSELVES
ON THE NOTICE OF ONE, WITHOUT INJURING THE RIGHTS OF THE OTHER.
I CONSIDER A COUNTRY-DANCE AS AN EMBLEM OF MARRIAGE. FIDELITY AND
COMPLAISANCE ARE THE PRINCIPAL DUTIES OF BOTH; AND THOSE MEN WHO DO NOT
CHOOSE TO DANCE OR MARRY THEMSELVES, HAVE NO BUSINESS WITH THE PARTNERS
OR WIVES OF THEIR NEIGHBOURS."

"BUT THEY ARE SUCH VERY DIFFERENT THINGS!"

"--THAT YOU THINK THEY CANNOT BE COMPARED TOGETHER."

"TO BE SURE NOT. PEOPLE THAT MARRY CAN NEVER PART, BUT MUST GO AND KEEP
HOUSE TOGETHER. PEOPLE THAT DANCE ONLY STAND OPPOSITE EACH OTHER IN A
LONG ROOM FOR HALF AN HOUR."

"AND SUCH IS YOUR DEFINITION OF MATRIMONY AND DANCING. TAKEN IN THAT
LIGHT CERTAINLY, THEIR RESEMBLANCE IS NOT STRIKING; BUT I THINK I COULD
PLACE THEM IN SUCH A VIEW. YOU WILL ALLOW, THAT IN BOTH, MAN HAS THE
ADVANTAGE OF CHOICE, WOMAN ONLY THE POWER OF REFUSAL; THAT IN BOTH,
IT IS AN ENGAGEMENT BETWEEN MAN AND WOMAN, FORMED FOR THE ADVANTAGE OF
EACH; AND THAT WHEN ONCE ENTERED INTO, THEY BELONG EXCLUSIVELY TO EACH
OTHER TILL THE MOMENT OF ITS DISSOLUTION; THAT IT IS THEIR DUTY, EACH
TO ENDEAVOUR TO GIVE THE OTHER NO CAUSE FOR WISHING THAT HE OR SHE HAD
BESTOWED THEMSELVES ELSEWHERE, AND THEIR BEST INTEREST TO KEEP THEIR OWN
IMAGINATIONS FROM WANDERING TOWARDS THE PERFECTIONS OF THEIR NEIGHBOURS,
OR FANCYING THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER OFF WITH ANYONE ELSE. YOU
WILL ALLOW ALL THIS?"

"YES, TO BE SURE, AS YOU STATE IT, ALL THIS SOUNDS VERY WELL; BUT STILL
THEY ARE SO VERY DIFFERENT. I CANNOT LOOK UPON THEM AT ALL IN THE SAME
LIGHT, NOR THINK THE SAME DUTIES BELONG TO THEM."

"IN ONE RESPECT, THERE CERTAINLY IS A DIFFERENCE. IN MARRIAGE, THE MAN
IS SUPPOSED TO PROVIDE FOR THE SUPPORT OF THE WOMAN, THE WOMAN TO MAKE
THE HOME AGREEABLE TO THE MAN; HE IS TO PURVEY, AND SHE IS TO SMILE.
BUT IN DANCING, THEIR DUTIES ARE EXACTLY CHANGED; THE AGREEABLENESS, THE
COMPLIANCE ARE EXPECTED FROM HIM, WHILE SHE FURNISHES THE FAN AND THE
LAVENDER WATER. THAT, I SUPPOSE, WAS THE DIFFERENCE OF DUTIES WHICH
STRUCK YOU, AS RENDERING THE CONDITIONS INCAPABLE OF COMPARISON."

"NO, INDEED, I NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT."

"THEN I AM QUITE AT A LOSS. ONE THING, HOWEVER, I MUST OBSERVE. THIS
DISPOSITION ON YOUR SIDE IS RATHER ALARMING. YOU TOTALLY DISALLOW ANY
SIMILARITY IN THE OBLIGATIONS; AND MAY I NOT THENCE INFER THAT YOUR
NOTIONS OF THE DUTIES OF THE DANCING STATE ARE NOT SO STRICT AS YOUR
PARTNER MIGHT WISH? HAVE I NOT REASON TO FEAR THAT IF THE GENTLEMAN WHO
SPOKE TO YOU JUST NOW WERE TO RETURN, OR IF ANY OTHER GENTLEMAN WERE TO
ADDRESS YOU, THERE WOULD BE NOTHING TO RESTRAIN YOU FROM CONVERSING WITH
HIM AS LONG AS YOU CHOSE?"

"MR. THORPE IS SUCH A VERY PARTICULAR FRIEND OF MY BROTHER'S, THAT IF HE
TALKS TO ME, I MUST TALK TO HIM AGAIN; BUT THERE ARE HARDLY THREE YOUNG
MEN IN THE ROOM BESIDES HIM THAT I HAVE ANY ACQUAINTANCE WITH."

"AND IS THAT TO BE MY ONLY SECURITY? ALAS, ALAS!"

"NAY, I AM SURE YOU CANNOT HAVE A BETTER; FOR IF I DO NOT KNOW ANYBODY,
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO TALK TO THEM; AND, BESIDES, I DO NOT WANT TO
TALK TO ANYBODY."

"NOW YOU HAVE GIVEN ME A SECURITY WORTH HAVING; AND I SHALL PROCEED
WITH COURAGE. DO YOU FIND BATH AS AGREEABLE AS WHEN I HAD THE HONOUR OF
MAKING THE INQUIRY BEFORE?"

"YES, QUITE--MORE SO, INDEED."

"MORE SO! TAKE CARE, OR YOU WILL FORGET TO BE TIRED OF IT AT THE PROPER
TIME. YOU OUGHT TO BE TIRED AT THE END OF SIX WEEKS."

"I DO NOT THINK I SHOULD BE TIRED, IF I WERE TO STAY HERE SIX MONTHS."

"BATH, COMPARED WITH LONDON, HAS LITTLE VARIETY, AND SO EVERYBODY FINDS
OUT EVERY YEAR. 'FOR SIX WEEKS, I ALLOW BATH IS PLEASANT ENOUGH; BUT
BEYOND THAT, IT IS THE MOST TIRESOME PLACE IN THE WORLD.' YOU WOULD BE
TOLD SO BY PEOPLE OF ALL DESCRIPTIONS, WHO COME REGULARLY EVERY WINTER,
LENGTHEN THEIR SIX WEEKS INTO TEN OR TWELVE, AND GO AWAY AT LAST BECAUSE
THEY CAN AFFORD TO STAY NO LONGER."

"WELL, OTHER PEOPLE MUST JUDGE FOR THEMSELVES, AND THOSE WHO GO TO
LONDON MAY THINK NOTHING OF BATH. BUT I, WHO LIVE IN A SMALL RETIRED
VILLAGE IN THE COUNTRY, CAN NEVER FIND GREATER SAMENESS IN SUCH A PLACE
AS THIS THAN IN MY OWN HOME; FOR HERE ARE A VARIETY OF AMUSEMENTS, A
VARIETY OF THINGS TO BE SEEN AND DONE ALL DAY LONG, WHICH I CAN KNOW
NOTHING OF THERE."

"YOU ARE NOT FOND OF THE COUNTRY."

"YES, I AM. I HAVE ALWAYS LIVED THERE, AND ALWAYS BEEN VERY HAPPY. BUT
CERTAINLY THERE IS MUCH MORE SAMENESS IN A COUNTRY LIFE THAN IN A BATH
LIFE. ONE DAY IN THE COUNTRY IS EXACTLY LIKE ANOTHER."

"BUT THEN YOU SPEND YOUR TIME SO MUCH MORE RATIONALLY IN THE COUNTRY."

"DO I?"

"DO YOU NOT?"

"I DO NOT BELIEVE THERE IS MUCH DIFFERENCE."

"HERE YOU ARE IN PURSUIT ONLY OF AMUSEMENT ALL DAY LONG."

"AND SO I AM AT HOME--ONLY I DO NOT FIND SO MUCH OF IT. I WALK ABOUT
HERE, AND SO I DO THERE; BUT HERE I SEE A VARIETY OF PEOPLE IN EVERY
STREET, AND THERE I CAN ONLY GO AND CALL ON MRS. ALLEN."

MR. TILNEY WAS VERY MUCH AMUSED.

"ONLY GO AND CALL ON MRS. ALLEN!" HE REPEATED. "WHAT A PICTURE OF
INTELLECTUAL POVERTY! HOWEVER, WHEN YOU SINK INTO THIS ABYSS AGAIN, YOU
WILL HAVE MORE TO SAY. YOU WILL BE ABLE TO TALK OF BATH, AND OF ALL THAT
YOU DID HERE."

"OH! YES. I SHALL NEVER BE IN WANT OF SOMETHING TO TALK OF AGAIN TO MRS.
ALLEN, OR ANYBODY ELSE. I REALLY BELIEVE I SHALL ALWAYS BE TALKING OF
BATH, WHEN I AM AT HOME AGAIN--I DO LIKE IT SO VERY MUCH. IF I COULD BUT
HAVE PAPA AND MAMMA, AND THE REST OF THEM HERE, I SUPPOSE I SHOULD BE
TOO HAPPY! JAMES'S COMING (MY ELDEST BROTHER) IS QUITE DELIGHTFUL--AND
ESPECIALLY AS IT TURNS OUT THAT THE VERY FAMILY WE ARE JUST GOT SO
INTIMATE WITH ARE HIS INTIMATE FRIENDS ALREADY. OH! WHO CAN EVER BE
TIRED OF BATH?"

"NOT THOSE WHO BRING SUCH FRESH FEELINGS OF EVERY SORT TO IT AS YOU DO.
BUT PAPAS AND MAMMAS, AND BROTHERS, AND INTIMATE FRIENDS ARE A GOOD DEAL
GONE BY, TO MOST OF THE FREQUENTERS OF BATH--AND THE HONEST RELISH OF
BALLS AND PLAYS, AND EVERYDAY SIGHTS, IS PAST WITH THEM." HERE
THEIR CONVERSATION CLOSED, THE DEMANDS OF THE DANCE BECOMING NOW TOO
IMPORTUNATE FOR A DIVIDED ATTENTION.

SOON AFTER THEIR REACHING THE BOTTOM OF THE SET, CATHERINE PERCEIVED
HERSELF TO BE EARNESTLY REGARDED BY A GENTLEMAN WHO STOOD AMONG THE
LOOKERS-ON, IMMEDIATELY BEHIND HER PARTNER. HE WAS A VERY HANDSOME MAN,
OF A COMMANDING ASPECT, PAST THE BLOOM, BUT NOT PAST THE VIGOUR OF
LIFE; AND WITH HIS EYE STILL DIRECTED TOWARDS HER, SHE SAW HIM PRESENTLY
ADDRESS MR. TILNEY IN A FAMILIAR WHISPER. CONFUSED BY HIS NOTICE, AND
BLUSHING FROM THE FEAR OF ITS BEING EXCITED BY SOMETHING WRONG IN
HER APPEARANCE, SHE TURNED AWAY HER HEAD. BUT WHILE SHE DID SO, THE
GENTLEMAN RETREATED, AND HER PARTNER, COMING NEARER, SAID, "I SEE THAT
YOU GUESS WHAT I HAVE JUST BEEN ASKED. THAT GENTLEMAN KNOWS YOUR NAME,
AND YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW HIS. IT IS GENERAL TILNEY, MY FATHER."

CATHERINE'S ANSWER WAS ONLY "OH!"--BUT IT WAS AN "OH!" EXPRESSING
EVERYTHING NEEDFUL: ATTENTION TO HIS WORDS, AND PERFECT RELIANCE ON
THEIR TRUTH. WITH REAL INTEREST AND STRONG ADMIRATION DID HER EYE NOW
FOLLOW THE GENERAL, AS HE MOVED THROUGH THE CROWD, AND "HOW HANDSOME A
FAMILY THEY ARE!" WAS HER SECRET REMARK.

IN CHATTING WITH MISS TILNEY BEFORE THE EVENING CONCLUDED, A NEW SOURCE
OF FELICITY AROSE TO HER. SHE HAD NEVER TAKEN A COUNTRY WALK SINCE
HER ARRIVAL IN BATH. MISS TILNEY, TO WHOM ALL THE COMMONLY FREQUENTED
ENVIRONS WERE FAMILIAR, SPOKE OF THEM IN TERMS WHICH MADE HER ALL
EAGERNESS TO KNOW THEM TOO; AND ON HER OPENLY FEARING THAT SHE MIGHT
FIND NOBODY TO GO WITH HER, IT WAS PROPOSED BY THE BROTHER AND SISTER
THAT THEY SHOULD JOIN IN A WALK, SOME MORNING OR OTHER. "I SHALL LIKE
IT," SHE CRIED, "BEYOND ANYTHING IN THE WORLD; AND DO NOT LET US PUT
IT OFF--LET US GO TOMORROW." THIS WAS READILY AGREED TO, WITH ONLY A
PROVISO OF MISS TILNEY'S, THAT IT DID NOT RAIN, WHICH CATHERINE WAS SURE
IT WOULD NOT. AT TWELVE O'CLOCK, THEY WERE TO CALL FOR HER IN PULTENEY
STREET; AND "REMEMBER--TWELVE O'CLOCK," WAS HER PARTING SPEECH TO
HER NEW FRIEND. OF HER OTHER, HER OLDER, HER MORE ESTABLISHED FRIEND,
ISABELLA, OF WHOSE FIDELITY AND WORTH SHE HAD ENJOYED A FORTNIGHT'S
EXPERIENCE, SHE SCARCELY SAW ANYTHING DURING THE EVENING. YET, THOUGH
LONGING TO MAKE HER ACQUAINTED WITH HER HAPPINESS, SHE CHEERFULLY
SUBMITTED TO THE WISH OF MR. ALLEN, WHICH TOOK THEM RATHER EARLY AWAY,
AND HER SPIRITS DANCED WITHIN HER, AS SHE DANCED IN HER CHAIR ALL THE
WAY HOME.




CHAPTER 11


THE MORROW BROUGHT A VERY SOBER-LOOKING MORNING, THE SUN MAKING ONLY
A FEW EFFORTS TO APPEAR, AND CATHERINE AUGURED FROM IT EVERYTHING MOST
FAVOURABLE TO HER WISHES. A BRIGHT MORNING SO EARLY IN THE YEAR,
SHE ALLOWED, WOULD GENERALLY TURN TO RAIN, BUT A CLOUDY ONE FORETOLD
IMPROVEMENT AS THE DAY ADVANCED. SHE APPLIED TO MR. ALLEN FOR
CONFIRMATION OF HER HOPES, BUT MR. ALLEN, NOT HAVING HIS OWN SKIES AND
BAROMETER ABOUT HIM, DECLINED GIVING ANY ABSOLUTE PROMISE OF SUNSHINE.
SHE APPLIED TO MRS. ALLEN, AND MRS. ALLEN'S OPINION WAS MORE POSITIVE.
"SHE HAD NO DOUBT IN THE WORLD OF ITS BEING A VERY FINE DAY, IF THE
CLOUDS WOULD ONLY GO OFF, AND THE SUN KEEP OUT."

AT ABOUT ELEVEN O'CLOCK, HOWEVER, A FEW SPECKS OF SMALL RAIN UPON THE
WINDOWS CAUGHT CATHERINE'S WATCHFUL EYE, AND "OH! DEAR, I DO BELIEVE IT
WILL BE WET," BROKE FROM HER IN A MOST DESPONDING TONE.

"I THOUGHT HOW IT WOULD BE," SAID MRS. ALLEN.

"NO WALK FOR ME TODAY," SIGHED CATHERINE; "BUT PERHAPS IT MAY COME TO
NOTHING, OR IT MAY HOLD UP BEFORE TWELVE."

"PERHAPS IT MAY, BUT THEN, MY DEAR, IT WILL BE SO DIRTY."

"OH! THAT WILL NOT SIGNIFY; I NEVER MIND DIRT."

"NO," REPLIED HER FRIEND VERY PLACIDLY, "I KNOW YOU NEVER MIND DIRT."

AFTER A SHORT PAUSE, "IT COMES ON FASTER AND FASTER!" SAID CATHERINE, AS
SHE STOOD WATCHING AT A WINDOW.

"SO IT DOES INDEED. IF IT KEEPS RAINING, THE STREETS WILL BE VERY WET."

"THERE ARE FOUR UMBRELLAS UP ALREADY. HOW I HATE THE SIGHT OF AN
UMBRELLA!"

"THEY ARE DISAGREEABLE THINGS TO CARRY. I WOULD MUCH RATHER TAKE A CHAIR
AT ANY TIME."

"IT WAS SUCH A NICE-LOOKING MORNING! I FELT SO CONVINCED IT WOULD BE
DRY!"

"ANYBODY WOULD HAVE THOUGHT SO INDEED. THERE WILL BE VERY FEW PEOPLE IN
THE PUMP-ROOM, IF IT RAINS ALL THE MORNING. I HOPE MR. ALLEN WILL PUT
ON HIS GREATCOAT WHEN HE GOES, BUT I DARE SAY HE WILL NOT, FOR HE HAD
RATHER DO ANYTHING IN THE WORLD THAN WALK OUT IN A GREATCOAT; I WONDER
HE SHOULD DISLIKE IT, IT MUST BE SO COMFORTABLE."

THE RAIN CONTINUED--FAST, THOUGH NOT HEAVY. CATHERINE WENT EVERY FIVE
MINUTES TO THE CLOCK, THREATENING ON EACH RETURN THAT, IF IT STILL
KEPT ON RAINING ANOTHER FIVE MINUTES, SHE WOULD GIVE UP THE MATTER AS
HOPELESS. THE CLOCK STRUCK TWELVE, AND IT STILL RAINED. "YOU WILL NOT BE
ABLE TO GO, MY DEAR."

"I DO NOT QUITE DESPAIR YET. I SHALL NOT GIVE IT UP TILL A QUARTER AFTER
TWELVE. THIS IS JUST THE TIME OF DAY FOR IT TO CLEAR UP, AND I DO THINK
IT LOOKS A LITTLE LIGHTER. THERE, IT IS TWENTY MINUTES AFTER TWELVE, AND
NOW I SHALL GIVE IT UP ENTIRELY. OH! THAT WE HAD SUCH WEATHER HERE
AS THEY HAD AT UDOLPHO, OR AT LEAST IN TUSCANY AND THE SOUTH OF
FRANCE!--THE NIGHT THAT POOR ST. AUBIN DIED!--SUCH BEAUTIFUL WEATHER!"

AT HALF PAST TWELVE, WHEN CATHERINE'S ANXIOUS ATTENTION TO THE WEATHER
WAS OVER AND SHE COULD NO LONGER CLAIM ANY MERIT FROM ITS AMENDMENT, THE
SKY BEGAN VOLUNTARILY TO CLEAR. A GLEAM OF SUNSHINE TOOK HER QUITE BY
SURPRISE; SHE LOOKED ROUND; THE CLOUDS WERE PARTING, AND SHE INSTANTLY
RETURNED TO THE WINDOW TO WATCH OVER AND ENCOURAGE THE HAPPY APPEARANCE.
TEN MINUTES MORE MADE IT CERTAIN THAT A BRIGHT AFTERNOON WOULD SUCCEED,
AND JUSTIFIED THE OPINION OF MRS. ALLEN, WHO HAD "ALWAYS THOUGHT IT
WOULD CLEAR UP." BUT WHETHER CATHERINE MIGHT STILL EXPECT HER FRIENDS,
WHETHER THERE HAD NOT BEEN TOO MUCH RAIN FOR MISS TILNEY TO VENTURE,
MUST YET BE A QUESTION.

IT WAS TOO DIRTY FOR MRS. ALLEN TO ACCOMPANY HER HUSBAND TO THE
PUMP-ROOM; HE ACCORDINGLY SET OFF BY HIMSELF, AND CATHERINE HAD BARELY
WATCHED HIM DOWN THE STREET WHEN HER NOTICE WAS CLAIMED BY THE APPROACH
OF THE SAME TWO OPEN CARRIAGES, CONTAINING THE SAME THREE PEOPLE THAT
HAD SURPRISED HER SO MUCH A FEW MORNINGS BACK.

"ISABELLA, MY BROTHER, AND MR. THORPE, I DECLARE! THEY ARE COMING FOR
ME PERHAPS--BUT I SHALL NOT GO--I CANNOT GO INDEED, FOR YOU KNOW MISS
TILNEY MAY STILL CALL." MRS. ALLEN AGREED TO IT. JOHN THORPE WAS SOON
WITH THEM, AND HIS VOICE WAS WITH THEM YET SOONER, FOR ON THE STAIRS HE
WAS CALLING OUT TO MISS MORLAND TO BE QUICK. "MAKE HASTE! MAKE HASTE!"
AS HE THREW OPEN THE DOOR. "PUT ON YOUR HAT THIS MOMENT--THERE IS NO
TIME TO BE LOST--WE ARE GOING TO BRISTOL. HOW D'YE DO, MRS. ALLEN?"

"TO BRISTOL! IS NOT THAT A GREAT WAY OFF? BUT, HOWEVER, I CANNOT GO WITH
YOU TODAY, BECAUSE I AM ENGAGED; I EXPECT SOME FRIENDS EVERY MOMENT."
THIS WAS OF COURSE VEHEMENTLY TALKED DOWN AS NO REASON AT ALL; MRS.
ALLEN WAS CALLED ON TO SECOND HIM, AND THE TWO OTHERS WALKED IN, TO GIVE
THEIR ASSISTANCE. "MY SWEETEST CATHERINE, IS NOT THIS DELIGHTFUL? WE
SHALL HAVE A MOST HEAVENLY DRIVE. YOU ARE TO THANK YOUR BROTHER AND ME
FOR THE SCHEME; IT DARTED INTO OUR HEADS AT BREAKFAST-TIME, I VERILY
BELIEVE AT THE SAME INSTANT; AND WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN OFF TWO HOURS AGO
IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR THIS DETESTABLE RAIN. BUT IT DOES NOT SIGNIFY,
THE NIGHTS ARE MOONLIGHT, AND WE SHALL DO DELIGHTFULLY. OH! I AM IN SUCH
ECSTASIES AT THE THOUGHTS OF A LITTLE COUNTRY AIR AND QUIET! SO MUCH
BETTER THAN GOING TO THE LOWER ROOMS. WE SHALL DRIVE DIRECTLY TO CLIFTON
AND DINE THERE; AND, AS SOON AS DINNER IS OVER, IF THERE IS TIME FOR IT,
GO ON TO KINGSWESTON."

"I DOUBT OUR BEING ABLE TO DO SO MUCH," SAID MORLAND.

"YOU CROAKING FELLOW!" CRIED THORPE. "WE SHALL BE ABLE TO DO TEN TIMES
MORE. KINGSWESTON! AYE, AND BLAIZE CASTLE TOO, AND ANYTHING ELSE WE CAN
HEAR OF; BUT HERE IS YOUR SISTER SAYS SHE WILL NOT GO."

"BLAIZE CASTLE!" CRIED CATHERINE. "WHAT IS THAT'?"

"THE FINEST PLACE IN ENGLAND--WORTH GOING FIFTY MILES AT ANY TIME TO
SEE."

"WHAT, IS IT REALLY A CASTLE, AN OLD CASTLE?"

"THE OLDEST IN THE KINGDOM."

"BUT IS IT LIKE WHAT ONE READS OF?"

"EXACTLY--THE VERY SAME."

"BUT NOW REALLY--ARE THERE TOWERS AND LONG GALLERIES?"

"BY DOZENS."

"THEN I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE IT; BUT I CANNOT--I CANNOT GO.

"NOT GO! MY BELOVED CREATURE, WHAT DO YOU MEAN'?"

"I CANNOT GO, BECAUSE"--LOOKING DOWN AS SHE SPOKE, FEARFUL OF ISABELLA'S
SMILE--"I EXPECT MISS TILNEY AND HER BROTHER TO CALL ON ME TO TAKE A
COUNTRY WALK. THEY PROMISED TO COME AT TWELVE, ONLY IT RAINED; BUT NOW,
AS IT IS SO FINE, I DARE SAY THEY WILL BE HERE SOON."

"NOT THEY INDEED," CRIED THORPE; "FOR, AS WE TURNED INTO BROAD STREET, I
SAW THEM--DOES HE NOT DRIVE A PHAETON WITH BRIGHT CHESTNUTS?"

"I DO NOT KNOW INDEED."

"YES, I KNOW HE DOES; I SAW HIM. YOU ARE TALKING OF THE MAN YOU DANCED
WITH LAST NIGHT, ARE NOT YOU?"

"YES.

"WELL, I SAW HIM AT THAT MOMENT TURN UP THE LANSDOWN ROAD, DRIVING A
SMART-LOOKING GIRL."

"DID YOU INDEED?"

"DID UPON MY SOUL; KNEW HIM AGAIN DIRECTLY, AND HE SEEMED TO HAVE GOT
SOME VERY PRETTY CATTLE TOO."

"IT IS VERY ODD! BUT I SUPPOSE THEY THOUGHT IT WOULD BE TOO DIRTY FOR A
WALK."

"AND WELL THEY MIGHT, FOR I NEVER SAW SO MUCH DIRT IN MY LIFE. WALK!
YOU COULD NO MORE WALK THAN YOU COULD FLY! IT HAS NOT BEEN SO DIRTY THE
WHOLE WINTER; IT IS ANKLE-DEEP EVERYWHERE."

ISABELLA CORROBORATED IT: "MY DEAREST CATHERINE, YOU CANNOT FORM AN IDEA
OF THE DIRT; COME, YOU MUST GO; YOU CANNOT REFUSE GOING NOW."

"I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE THE CASTLE; BUT MAY WE GO ALL OVER IT? MAY WE GO
UP EVERY STAIRCASE, AND INTO EVERY SUITE OF ROOMS?"

"YES, YES, EVERY HOLE AND CORNER."

"BUT THEN, IF THEY SHOULD ONLY BE GONE OUT FOR AN HOUR TILL IT IS DRYER,
AND CALL BY AND BY?"

"MAKE YOURSELF EASY, THERE IS NO DANGER OF THAT, FOR I HEARD TILNEY
HALLOOING TO A MAN WHO WAS JUST PASSING BY ON HORSEBACK, THAT THEY WERE
GOING AS FAR AS WICK ROCKS."

"THEN I WILL. SHALL I GO, MRS. ALLEN?"

"JUST AS YOU PLEASE, MY DEAR."

"MRS. ALLEN, YOU MUST PERSUADE HER TO GO," WAS THE GENERAL CRY. MRS.
ALLEN WAS NOT INATTENTIVE TO IT: "WELL, MY DEAR," SAID SHE, "SUPPOSE YOU
GO." AND IN TWO MINUTES THEY WERE OFF.

CATHERINE'S FEELINGS, AS SHE GOT INTO THE CARRIAGE, WERE IN A VERY
UNSETTLED STATE; DIVIDED BETWEEN REGRET FOR THE LOSS OF ONE GREAT
PLEASURE, AND THE HOPE OF SOON ENJOYING ANOTHER, ALMOST ITS EQUAL IN
DEGREE, HOWEVER UNLIKE IN KIND. SHE COULD NOT THINK THE TILNEYS HAD
ACTED QUITE WELL BY HER, IN SO READILY GIVING UP THEIR ENGAGEMENT,
WITHOUT SENDING HER ANY MESSAGE OF EXCUSE. IT WAS NOW BUT AN HOUR LATER
THAN THE TIME FIXED ON FOR THE BEGINNING OF THEIR WALK; AND, IN SPITE OF
WHAT SHE HAD HEARD OF THE PRODIGIOUS ACCUMULATION OF DIRT IN THE COURSE
OF THAT HOUR, SHE COULD NOT FROM HER OWN OBSERVATION HELP THINKING THAT
THEY MIGHT HAVE GONE WITH VERY LITTLE INCONVENIENCE. TO FEEL HERSELF
SLIGHTED BY THEM WAS VERY PAINFUL. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE DELIGHT OF
EXPLORING AN EDIFICE LIKE UDOLPHO, AS HER FANCY REPRESENTED BLAIZE
CASTLE TO BE, WAS SUCH A COUNTERPOISE OF GOOD AS MIGHT CONSOLE HER FOR
ALMOST ANYTHING.

THEY PASSED BRISKLY DOWN PULTENEY STREET, AND THROUGH LAURA PLACE,
WITHOUT THE EXCHANGE OF MANY WORDS. THORPE TALKED TO HIS HORSE, AND SHE
MEDITATED, BY TURNS, ON BROKEN PROMISES AND BROKEN ARCHES, PHAETONS
AND FALSE HANGINGS, TILNEYS AND TRAP-DOORS. AS THEY ENTERED ARGYLE
BUILDINGS, HOWEVER, SHE WAS ROUSED BY THIS ADDRESS FROM HER COMPANION,
"WHO IS THAT GIRL WHO LOOKED AT YOU SO HARD AS SHE WENT BY?"

"WHO? WHERE?"

"ON THE RIGHT-HAND PAVEMENT--SHE MUST BE ALMOST OUT OF SIGHT NOW."
CATHERINE LOOKED ROUND AND SAW MISS TILNEY LEANING ON HER BROTHER'S ARM,
WALKING SLOWLY DOWN THE STREET. SHE SAW THEM BOTH LOOKING BACK AT HER.
"STOP, STOP, MR. THORPE," SHE IMPATIENTLY CRIED; "IT IS MISS TILNEY; IT
IS INDEED. HOW COULD YOU TELL ME THEY WERE GONE? STOP, STOP, I WILL
GET OUT THIS MOMENT AND GO TO THEM." BUT TO WHAT PURPOSE DID SHE SPEAK?
THORPE ONLY LASHED HIS HORSE INTO A BRISKER TROT; THE TILNEYS, WHO HAD
SOON CEASED TO LOOK AFTER HER, WERE IN A MOMENT OUT OF SIGHT ROUND THE
CORNER OF LAURA PLACE, AND IN ANOTHER MOMENT SHE WAS HERSELF WHISKED
INTO THE MARKETPLACE. STILL, HOWEVER, AND DURING THE LENGTH OF ANOTHER
STREET, SHE ENTREATED HIM TO STOP. "PRAY, PRAY STOP, MR. THORPE. I
CANNOT GO ON. I WILL NOT GO ON. I MUST GO BACK TO MISS TILNEY." BUT MR.
THORPE ONLY LAUGHED, SMACKED HIS WHIP, ENCOURAGED HIS HORSE, MADE ODD
NOISES, AND DROVE ON; AND CATHERINE, ANGRY AND VEXED AS SHE WAS, HAVING
NO POWER OF GETTING AWAY, WAS OBLIGED TO GIVE UP THE POINT AND SUBMIT.
HER REPROACHES, HOWEVER, WERE NOT SPARED. "HOW COULD YOU DECEIVE ME SO,
MR. THORPE? HOW COULD YOU SAY THAT YOU SAW THEM DRIVING UP THE LANSDOWN
ROAD? I WOULD NOT HAVE HAD IT HAPPEN SO FOR THE WORLD. THEY MUST THINK
IT SO STRANGE, SO RUDE OF ME! TO GO BY THEM, TOO, WITHOUT SAYING A WORD!
YOU DO NOT KNOW HOW VEXED I AM; I SHALL HAVE NO PLEASURE AT CLIFTON, NOR
IN ANYTHING ELSE. I HAD RATHER, TEN THOUSAND TIMES RATHER, GET OUT NOW,
AND WALK BACK TO THEM. HOW COULD YOU SAY YOU SAW THEM DRIVING OUT IN A
PHAETON?" THORPE DEFENDED HIMSELF VERY STOUTLY, DECLARED HE HAD NEVER
SEEN TWO MEN SO MUCH ALIKE IN HIS LIFE, AND WOULD HARDLY GIVE UP THE
POINT OF ITS HAVING BEEN TILNEY HIMSELF.

THEIR DRIVE, EVEN WHEN THIS SUBJECT WAS OVER, WAS NOT LIKELY TO BE VERY
AGREEABLE. CATHERINE'S COMPLAISANCE WAS NO LONGER WHAT IT HAD BEEN IN
THEIR FORMER AIRING. SHE LISTENED RELUCTANTLY, AND HER REPLIES WERE
SHORT. BLAIZE CASTLE REMAINED HER ONLY COMFORT; TOWARDS THAT, SHE STILL
LOOKED AT INTERVALS WITH PLEASURE; THOUGH RATHER THAN BE DISAPPOINTED OF
THE PROMISED WALK, AND ESPECIALLY RATHER THAN BE THOUGHT ILL OF BY THE
TILNEYS, SHE WOULD WILLINGLY HAVE GIVEN UP ALL THE HAPPINESS WHICH ITS
WALLS COULD SUPPLY--THE HAPPINESS OF A PROGRESS THROUGH A LONG SUITE OF
LOFTY ROOMS, EXHIBITING THE REMAINS OF MAGNIFICENT FURNITURE, THOUGH
NOW FOR MANY YEARS DESERTED--THE HAPPINESS OF BEING STOPPED IN THEIR WAY
ALONG NARROW, WINDING VAULTS, BY A LOW, GRATED DOOR; OR EVEN OF HAVING
THEIR LAMP, THEIR ONLY LAMP, EXTINGUISHED BY A SUDDEN GUST OF WIND, AND
OF BEING LEFT IN TOTAL DARKNESS. IN THE MEANWHILE, THEY PROCEEDED ON
THEIR JOURNEY WITHOUT ANY MISCHANCE, AND WERE WITHIN VIEW OF THE TOWN
OF KEYNSHAM, WHEN A HALLOO FROM MORLAND, WHO WAS BEHIND THEM, MADE HIS
FRIEND PULL UP, TO KNOW WHAT WAS THE MATTER. THE OTHERS THEN CAME CLOSE
ENOUGH FOR CONVERSATION, AND MORLAND SAID, "WE HAD BETTER GO BACK,
THORPE; IT IS TOO LATE TO GO ON TODAY; YOUR SISTER THINKS SO AS WELL AS
I. WE HAVE BEEN EXACTLY AN HOUR COMING FROM PULTENEY STREET, VERY LITTLE
MORE THAN SEVEN MILES; AND, I SUPPOSE, WE HAVE AT LEAST EIGHT MORE TO
GO. IT WILL NEVER DO. WE SET OUT A GREAT DEAL TOO LATE. WE HAD MUCH
BETTER PUT IT OFF TILL ANOTHER DAY, AND TURN ROUND."

"IT IS ALL ONE TO ME," REPLIED THORPE RATHER ANGRILY; AND INSTANTLY
TURNING HIS HORSE, THEY WERE ON THEIR WAY BACK TO BATH.

"IF YOUR BROTHER HAD NOT GOT SUCH A D--BEAST TO DRIVE," SAID HE SOON
AFTERWARDS, "WE MIGHT HAVE DONE IT VERY WELL. MY HORSE WOULD HAVE
TROTTED TO CLIFTON WITHIN THE HOUR, IF LEFT TO HIMSELF, AND I HAVE
ALMOST BROKE MY ARM WITH PULLING HIM IN TO THAT CURSED BROKEN-WINDED
JADE'S PACE. MORLAND IS A FOOL FOR NOT KEEPING A HORSE AND GIG OF HIS
OWN."

"NO, HE IS NOT," SAID CATHERINE WARMLY, "FOR I AM SURE HE COULD NOT
AFFORD IT."

"AND WHY CANNOT HE AFFORD IT?"

"BECAUSE HE HAS NOT MONEY ENOUGH."

"AND WHOSE FAULT IS THAT?"

"NOBODY'S, THAT I KNOW OF." THORPE THEN SAID SOMETHING IN THE LOUD,
INCOHERENT WAY TO WHICH HE HAD OFTEN RECOURSE, ABOUT ITS BEING A
D--THING TO BE MISERLY; AND THAT IF PEOPLE WHO ROLLED IN MONEY COULD NOT
AFFORD THINGS, HE DID NOT KNOW WHO COULD, WHICH CATHERINE DID NOT EVEN
ENDEAVOUR TO UNDERSTAND. DISAPPOINTED OF WHAT WAS TO HAVE BEEN THE
CONSOLATION FOR HER FIRST DISAPPOINTMENT, SHE WAS LESS AND LESS DISPOSED
EITHER TO BE AGREEABLE HERSELF OR TO FIND HER COMPANION SO; AND THEY
RETURNED TO PULTENEY STREET WITHOUT HER SPEAKING TWENTY WORDS.

AS SHE ENTERED THE HOUSE, THE FOOTMAN TOLD HER THAT A GENTLEMAN AND LADY
HAD CALLED AND INQUIRED FOR HER A FEW MINUTES AFTER HER SETTING OFF;
THAT, WHEN HE TOLD THEM SHE WAS GONE OUT WITH MR. THORPE, THE LADY HAD
ASKED WHETHER ANY MESSAGE HAD BEEN LEFT FOR HER; AND ON HIS SAYING NO,
HAD FELT FOR A CARD, BUT SAID SHE HAD NONE ABOUT HER, AND WENT AWAY.
PONDERING OVER THESE HEART-RENDING TIDINGS, CATHERINE WALKED SLOWLY
UPSTAIRS. AT THE HEAD OF THEM SHE WAS MET BY MR. ALLEN, WHO, ON HEARING
THE REASON OF THEIR SPEEDY RETURN, SAID, "I AM GLAD YOUR BROTHER HAD SO
MUCH SENSE; I AM GLAD YOU ARE COME BACK. IT WAS A STRANGE, WILD SCHEME."

THEY ALL SPENT THE EVENING TOGETHER AT THORPE'S. CATHERINE WAS DISTURBED
AND OUT OF SPIRITS; BUT ISABELLA SEEMED TO FIND A POOL OF COMMERCE, IN
THE FATE OF WHICH SHE SHARED, BY PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP WITH MORLAND, A
VERY GOOD EQUIVALENT FOR THE QUIET AND COUNTRY AIR OF AN INN AT CLIFTON.
HER SATISFACTION, TOO, IN NOT BEING AT THE LOWER ROOMS WAS SPOKEN MORE
THAN ONCE. "HOW I PITY THE POOR CREATURES THAT ARE GOING THERE! HOW GLAD
I AM THAT I AM NOT AMONGST THEM! I WONDER WHETHER IT WILL BE A FULL BALL
OR NOT! THEY HAVE NOT BEGUN DANCING YET. I WOULD NOT BE THERE FOR
ALL THE WORLD. IT IS SO DELIGHTFUL TO HAVE AN EVENING NOW AND THEN
TO ONESELF. I DARE SAY IT WILL NOT BE A VERY GOOD BALL. I KNOW THE
MITCHELLS WILL NOT BE THERE. I AM SURE I PITY EVERYBODY THAT IS. BUT I
DARE SAY, MR. MORLAND, YOU LONG TO BE AT IT, DO NOT YOU? I AM SURE YOU
DO. WELL, PRAY DO NOT LET ANYBODY HERE BE A RESTRAINT ON YOU. I DARE SAY
WE COULD DO VERY WELL WITHOUT YOU; BUT YOU MEN THINK YOURSELVES OF SUCH
CONSEQUENCE."

CATHERINE COULD ALMOST HAVE ACCUSED ISABELLA OF BEING WANTING IN
TENDERNESS TOWARDS HERSELF AND HER SORROWS, SO VERY LITTLE DID THEY
APPEAR TO DWELL ON HER MIND, AND SO VERY INADEQUATE WAS THE COMFORT SHE
OFFERED. "DO NOT BE SO DULL, MY DEAREST CREATURE," SHE WHISPERED. "YOU
WILL QUITE BREAK MY HEART. IT WAS AMAZINGLY SHOCKING, TO BE SURE; BUT
THE TILNEYS WERE ENTIRELY TO BLAME. WHY WERE NOT THEY MORE PUNCTUAL?
IT WAS DIRTY, INDEED, BUT WHAT DID THAT SIGNIFY? I AM SURE JOHN AND I
SHOULD NOT HAVE MINDED IT. I NEVER MIND GOING THROUGH ANYTHING, WHERE A
FRIEND IS CONCERNED; THAT IS MY DISPOSITION, AND JOHN IS JUST THE SAME;
HE HAS AMAZING STRONG FEELINGS. GOOD HEAVENS! WHAT A DELIGHTFUL HAND YOU
HAVE GOT! KINGS, I VOW! I NEVER WAS SO HAPPY IN MY LIFE! I WOULD FIFTY
TIMES RATHER YOU SHOULD HAVE THEM THAN MYSELF."

AND NOW I MAY DISMISS MY HEROINE TO THE SLEEPLESS COUCH, WHICH IS THE
TRUE HEROINE'S PORTION; TO A PILLOW STREWED WITH THORNS AND WET WITH
TEARS. AND LUCKY MAY SHE THINK HERSELF, IF SHE GET ANOTHER GOOD NIGHT'S
REST IN THE COURSE OF THE NEXT THREE MONTHS.




CHAPTER 12


"MRS. ALLEN," SAID CATHERINE THE NEXT MORNING, "WILL THERE BE ANY HARM
IN MY CALLING ON MISS TILNEY TODAY? I SHALL NOT BE EASY TILL I HAVE
EXPLAINED EVERYTHING."

"GO, BY ALL MEANS, MY DEAR; ONLY PUT ON A WHITE GOWN; MISS TILNEY ALWAYS
WEARS WHITE."

CATHERINE CHEERFULLY COMPLIED, AND BEING PROPERLY EQUIPPED, WAS MORE
IMPATIENT THAN EVER TO BE AT THE PUMP-ROOM, THAT SHE MIGHT INFORM
HERSELF OF GENERAL TILNEY'S LODGINGS, FOR THOUGH SHE BELIEVED THEY WERE
IN MILSOM STREET, SHE WAS NOT CERTAIN OF THE HOUSE, AND MRS. ALLEN'S
WAVERING CONVICTIONS ONLY MADE IT MORE DOUBTFUL. TO MILSOM STREET SHE
WAS DIRECTED, AND HAVING MADE HERSELF PERFECT IN THE NUMBER, HASTENED
AWAY WITH EAGER STEPS AND A BEATING HEART TO PAY HER VISIT, EXPLAIN HER
CONDUCT, AND BE FORGIVEN; TRIPPING LIGHTLY THROUGH THE CHURCH-YARD, AND
RESOLUTELY TURNING AWAY HER EYES, THAT SHE MIGHT NOT BE OBLIGED TO
SEE HER BELOVED ISABELLA AND HER DEAR FAMILY, WHO, SHE HAD REASON TO
BELIEVE, WERE IN A SHOP HARD BY. SHE REACHED THE HOUSE WITHOUT ANY
IMPEDIMENT, LOOKED AT THE NUMBER, KNOCKED AT THE DOOR, AND INQUIRED FOR
MISS TILNEY. THE MAN BELIEVED MISS TILNEY TO BE AT HOME, BUT WAS NOT
QUITE CERTAIN. WOULD SHE BE PLEASED TO SEND UP HER NAME? SHE GAVE HER
CARD. IN A FEW MINUTES THE SERVANT RETURNED, AND WITH A LOOK WHICH DID
NOT QUITE CONFIRM HIS WORDS, SAID HE HAD BEEN MISTAKEN, FOR THAT MISS
TILNEY WAS WALKED OUT. CATHERINE, WITH A BLUSH OF MORTIFICATION, LEFT
THE HOUSE. SHE FELT ALMOST PERSUADED THAT MISS TILNEY WAS AT HOME, AND
TOO MUCH OFFENDED TO ADMIT HER; AND AS SHE RETIRED DOWN THE STREET,
COULD NOT WITHHOLD ONE GLANCE AT THE DRAWING-ROOM WINDOWS, IN
EXPECTATION OF SEEING HER THERE, BUT NO ONE APPEARED AT THEM. AT THE
BOTTOM OF THE STREET, HOWEVER, SHE LOOKED BACK AGAIN, AND THEN, NOT AT A
WINDOW, BUT ISSUING FROM THE DOOR, SHE SAW MISS TILNEY HERSELF. SHE WAS
FOLLOWED BY A GENTLEMAN, WHOM CATHERINE BELIEVED TO BE HER FATHER,
AND THEY TURNED UP TOWARDS EDGAR'S BUILDINGS. CATHERINE, IN DEEP
MORTIFICATION, PROCEEDED ON HER WAY. SHE COULD ALMOST BE ANGRY HERSELF
AT SUCH ANGRY INCIVILITY; BUT SHE CHECKED THE RESENTFUL SENSATION; SHE
REMEMBERED HER OWN IGNORANCE. SHE KNEW NOT HOW SUCH AN OFFENCE AS HERS
MIGHT BE CLASSED BY THE LAWS OF WORLDLY POLITENESS, TO WHAT A DEGREE
OF UNFORGIVINGNESS IT MIGHT WITH PROPRIETY LEAD, NOR TO WHAT RIGOURS OF
RUDENESS IN RETURN IT MIGHT JUSTLY MAKE HER AMENABLE.

DEJECTED AND HUMBLED, SHE HAD EVEN SOME THOUGHTS OF NOT GOING WITH THE
OTHERS TO THE THEATRE THAT NIGHT; BUT IT MUST BE CONFESSED THAT THEY
WERE NOT OF LONG CONTINUANCE, FOR SHE SOON RECOLLECTED, IN THE FIRST
PLACE, THAT SHE WAS WITHOUT ANY EXCUSE FOR STAYING AT HOME; AND, IN THE
SECOND, THAT IT WAS A PLAY SHE WANTED VERY MUCH TO SEE. TO THE THEATRE
ACCORDINGLY THEY ALL WENT; NO TILNEYS APPEARED TO PLAGUE OR PLEASE HER;
SHE FEARED THAT, AMONGST THE MANY PERFECTIONS OF THE FAMILY, A FONDNESS
FOR PLAYS WAS NOT TO BE RANKED; BUT PERHAPS IT WAS BECAUSE THEY WERE
HABITUATED TO THE FINER PERFORMANCES OF THE LONDON STAGE, WHICH SHE
KNEW, ON ISABELLA'S AUTHORITY, RENDERED EVERYTHING ELSE OF THE KIND
"QUITE HORRID." SHE WAS NOT DECEIVED IN HER OWN EXPECTATION OF PLEASURE;
THE COMEDY SO WELL SUSPENDED HER CARE THAT NO ONE, OBSERVING HER DURING
THE FIRST FOUR ACTS, WOULD HAVE SUPPOSED SHE HAD ANY WRETCHEDNESS ABOUT
HER. ON THE BEGINNING OF THE FIFTH, HOWEVER, THE SUDDEN VIEW OF MR.
HENRY TILNEY AND HIS FATHER, JOINING A PARTY IN THE OPPOSITE BOX,
RECALLED HER TO ANXIETY AND DISTRESS. THE STAGE COULD NO LONGER EXCITE
GENUINE MERRIMENT--NO LONGER KEEP HER WHOLE ATTENTION. EVERY OTHER LOOK
UPON AN AVERAGE WAS DIRECTED TOWARDS THE OPPOSITE BOX; AND, FOR THE
SPACE OF TWO ENTIRE SCENES, DID SHE THUS WATCH HENRY TILNEY, WITHOUT
BEING ONCE ABLE TO CATCH HIS EYE. NO LONGER COULD HE BE SUSPECTED OF
INDIFFERENCE FOR A PLAY; HIS NOTICE WAS NEVER WITHDRAWN FROM THE STAGE
DURING TWO WHOLE SCENES. AT LENGTH, HOWEVER, HE DID LOOK TOWARDS HER,
AND HE BOWED--BUT SUCH A BOW! NO SMILE, NO CONTINUED OBSERVANCE ATTENDED
IT; HIS EYES WERE IMMEDIATELY RETURNED TO THEIR FORMER DIRECTION.
CATHERINE WAS RESTLESSLY MISERABLE; SHE COULD ALMOST HAVE RUN ROUND TO
THE BOX IN WHICH HE SAT AND FORCED HIM TO HEAR HER EXPLANATION. FEELINGS
RATHER NATURAL THAN HEROIC POSSESSED HER; INSTEAD OF CONSIDERING HER
OWN DIGNITY INJURED BY THIS READY CONDEMNATION--INSTEAD OF PROUDLY
RESOLVING, IN CONSCIOUS INNOCENCE, TO SHOW HER RESENTMENT TOWARDS HIM
WHO COULD HARBOUR A DOUBT OF IT, TO LEAVE TO HIM ALL THE TROUBLE
OF SEEKING AN EXPLANATION, AND TO ENLIGHTEN HIM ON THE PAST ONLY BY
AVOIDING HIS SIGHT, OR FLIRTING WITH SOMEBODY ELSE--SHE TOOK TO HERSELF
ALL THE SHAME OF MISCONDUCT, OR AT LEAST OF ITS APPEARANCE, AND WAS ONLY
EAGER FOR AN OPPORTUNITY OF EXPLAINING ITS CAUSE.

THE PLAY CONCLUDED--THE CURTAIN FELL--HENRY TILNEY WAS NO LONGER TO BE
SEEN WHERE HE HAD HITHERTO SAT, BUT HIS FATHER REMAINED, AND PERHAPS HE
MIGHT BE NOW COMING ROUND TO THEIR BOX. SHE WAS RIGHT; IN A FEW MINUTES
HE APPEARED, AND, MAKING HIS WAY THROUGH THE THEN THINNING ROWS, SPOKE
WITH LIKE CALM POLITENESS TO MRS. ALLEN AND HER FRIEND. NOT WITH SUCH
CALMNESS WAS HE ANSWERED BY THE LATTER: "OH! MR. TILNEY, I HAVE BEEN
QUITE WILD TO SPEAK TO YOU, AND MAKE MY APOLOGIES. YOU MUST HAVE THOUGHT
ME SO RUDE; BUT INDEED IT WAS NOT MY OWN FAULT, WAS IT, MRS. ALLEN?
DID NOT THEY TELL ME THAT MR. TILNEY AND HIS SISTER WERE GONE OUT IN A
PHAETON TOGETHER? AND THEN WHAT COULD I DO? BUT I HAD TEN THOUSAND TIMES
RATHER HAVE BEEN WITH YOU; NOW HAD NOT I, MRS. ALLEN?"

"MY DEAR, YOU TUMBLE MY GOWN," WAS MRS. ALLEN'S REPLY.

HER ASSURANCE, HOWEVER, STANDING SOLE AS IT DID, WAS NOT THROWN AWAY; IT
BROUGHT A MORE CORDIAL, MORE NATURAL SMILE INTO HIS COUNTENANCE, AND
HE REPLIED IN A TONE WHICH RETAINED ONLY A LITTLE AFFECTED RESERVE:
"WE WERE MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU AT ANY RATE FOR WISHING US A PLEASANT WALK
AFTER OUR PASSING YOU IN ARGYLE STREET: YOU WERE SO KIND AS TO LOOK BACK
ON PURPOSE."

"BUT INDEED I DID NOT WISH YOU A PLEASANT WALK; I NEVER THOUGHT OF SUCH
A THING; BUT I BEGGED MR. THORPE SO EARNESTLY TO STOP; I CALLED OUT TO
HIM AS SOON AS EVER I SAW YOU; NOW, MRS. ALLEN, DID NOT--OH! YOU WERE
NOT THERE; BUT INDEED I DID; AND, IF MR. THORPE WOULD ONLY HAVE STOPPED,
I WOULD HAVE JUMPED OUT AND RUN AFTER YOU."

IS THERE A HENRY IN THE WORLD WHO COULD BE INSENSIBLE TO SUCH A
DECLARATION? HENRY TILNEY AT LEAST WAS NOT. WITH A YET SWEETER SMILE, HE
SAID EVERYTHING THAT NEED BE SAID OF HIS SISTER'S CONCERN, REGRET, AND
DEPENDENCE ON CATHERINE'S HONOUR. "OH! DO NOT SAY MISS TILNEY WAS NOT
ANGRY," CRIED CATHERINE, "BECAUSE I KNOW SHE WAS; FOR SHE WOULD NOT SEE
ME THIS MORNING WHEN I CALLED; I SAW HER WALK OUT OF THE HOUSE THE NEXT
MINUTE AFTER MY LEAVING IT; I WAS HURT, BUT I WAS NOT AFFRONTED. PERHAPS
YOU DID NOT KNOW I HAD BEEN THERE."

"I WAS NOT WITHIN AT THE TIME; BUT I HEARD OF IT FROM ELEANOR, AND SHE
HAS BEEN WISHING EVER SINCE TO SEE YOU, TO EXPLAIN THE REASON OF SUCH
INCIVILITY; BUT PERHAPS I CAN DO IT AS WELL. IT WAS NOTHING MORE THAN
THAT MY FATHER--THEY WERE JUST PREPARING TO WALK OUT, AND HE BEING
HURRIED FOR TIME, AND NOT CARING TO HAVE IT PUT OFF--MADE A POINT OF HER
BEING DENIED. THAT WAS ALL, I DO ASSURE YOU. SHE WAS VERY MUCH VEXED,
AND MEANT TO MAKE HER APOLOGY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE."

CATHERINE'S MIND WAS GREATLY EASED BY THIS INFORMATION, YET A SOMETHING
OF SOLICITUDE REMAINED, FROM WHICH SPRANG THE FOLLOWING QUESTION,
THOROUGHLY ARTLESS IN ITSELF, THOUGH RATHER DISTRESSING TO THE
GENTLEMAN: "BUT, MR. TILNEY, WHY WERE YOU LESS GENEROUS THAN YOUR
SISTER? IF SHE FELT SUCH CONFIDENCE IN MY GOOD INTENTIONS, AND COULD
SUPPOSE IT TO BE ONLY A MISTAKE, WHY SHOULD YOU BE SO READY TO TAKE
OFFENCE?"

"ME! I TAKE OFFENCE!"

"NAY, I AM SURE BY YOUR LOOK, WHEN YOU CAME INTO THE BOX, YOU WERE
ANGRY."

"I ANGRY! I COULD HAVE NO RIGHT."

"WELL, NOBODY WOULD HAVE THOUGHT YOU HAD NO RIGHT WHO SAW YOUR FACE." HE
REPLIED BY ASKING HER TO MAKE ROOM FOR HIM, AND TALKING OF THE PLAY.

HE REMAINED WITH THEM SOME TIME, AND WAS ONLY TOO AGREEABLE FOR
CATHERINE TO BE CONTENTED WHEN HE WENT AWAY. BEFORE THEY PARTED,
HOWEVER, IT WAS AGREED THAT THE PROJECTED WALK SHOULD BE TAKEN AS SOON
AS POSSIBLE; AND, SETTING ASIDE THE MISERY OF HIS QUITTING THEIR BOX,
SHE WAS, UPON THE WHOLE, LEFT ONE OF THE HAPPIEST CREATURES IN THE
WORLD.

WHILE TALKING TO EACH OTHER, SHE HAD OBSERVED WITH SOME SURPRISE THAT
JOHN THORPE, WHO WAS NEVER IN THE SAME PART OF THE HOUSE FOR TEN MINUTES
TOGETHER, WAS ENGAGED IN CONVERSATION WITH GENERAL TILNEY; AND SHE FELT
SOMETHING MORE THAN SURPRISE WHEN SHE THOUGHT SHE COULD PERCEIVE HERSELF
THE OBJECT OF THEIR ATTENTION AND DISCOURSE. WHAT COULD THEY HAVE TO SAY
OF HER? SHE FEARED GENERAL TILNEY DID NOT LIKE HER APPEARANCE: SHE FOUND
IT WAS IMPLIED IN HIS PREVENTING HER ADMITTANCE TO HIS DAUGHTER, RATHER
THAN POSTPONE HIS OWN WALK A FEW MINUTES. "HOW CAME MR. THORPE TO KNOW
YOUR FATHER?" WAS HER ANXIOUS INQUIRY, AS SHE POINTED THEM OUT TO HER
COMPANION. HE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT IT; BUT HIS FATHER, LIKE EVERY MILITARY
MAN, HAD A VERY LARGE ACQUAINTANCE.

WHEN THE ENTERTAINMENT WAS OVER, THORPE CAME TO ASSIST THEM IN GETTING
OUT. CATHERINE WAS THE IMMEDIATE OBJECT OF HIS GALLANTRY; AND, WHILE
THEY WAITED IN THE LOBBY FOR A CHAIR, HE PREVENTED THE INQUIRY WHICH HAD
TRAVELLED FROM HER HEART ALMOST TO THE TIP OF HER TONGUE, BY ASKING, IN
A CONSEQUENTIAL MANNER, WHETHER SHE HAD SEEN HIM TALKING WITH GENERAL
TILNEY: "HE IS A FINE OLD FELLOW, UPON MY SOUL! STOUT, ACTIVE--LOOKS
AS YOUNG AS HIS SON. I HAVE A GREAT REGARD FOR HIM, I ASSURE YOU: A
GENTLEMAN-LIKE, GOOD SORT OF FELLOW AS EVER LIVED."

"BUT HOW CAME YOU TO KNOW HIM?"

"KNOW HIM! THERE ARE FEW PEOPLE MUCH ABOUT TOWN THAT I DO NOT KNOW. I
HAVE MET HIM FOREVER AT THE BEDFORD; AND I KNEW HIS FACE AGAIN TODAY THE
MOMENT HE CAME INTO THE BILLIARD-ROOM. ONE OF THE BEST PLAYERS WE HAVE,
BY THE BY; AND WE HAD A LITTLE TOUCH TOGETHER, THOUGH I WAS ALMOST
AFRAID OF HIM AT FIRST: THE ODDS WERE FIVE TO FOUR AGAINST ME; AND, IF
I HAD NOT MADE ONE OF THE CLEANEST STROKES THAT PERHAPS EVER WAS MADE IN
THIS WORLD--I TOOK HIS BALL EXACTLY--BUT I COULD NOT MAKE YOU UNDERSTAND
IT WITHOUT A TABLE; HOWEVER, I DID BEAT HIM. A VERY FINE FELLOW; AS RICH
AS A JEW. I SHOULD LIKE TO DINE WITH HIM; I DARE SAY HE GIVES FAMOUS
DINNERS. BUT WHAT DO YOU THINK WE HAVE BEEN TALKING OF? YOU. YES, BY
HEAVENS! AND THE GENERAL THINKS YOU THE FINEST GIRL IN BATH."

"OH! NONSENSE! HOW CAN YOU SAY SO?"

"AND WHAT DO YOU THINK I SAID?"--LOWERING HIS VOICE--"WELL DONE,
GENERAL, SAID I; I AM QUITE OF YOUR MIND."

HERE CATHERINE, WHO WAS MUCH LESS GRATIFIED BY HIS ADMIRATION THAN BY
GENERAL TILNEY'S, WAS NOT SORRY TO BE CALLED AWAY BY MR. ALLEN. THORPE,
HOWEVER, WOULD SEE HER TO HER CHAIR, AND, TILL SHE ENTERED IT, CONTINUED
THE SAME KIND OF DELICATE FLATTERY, IN SPITE OF HER ENTREATING HIM TO
HAVE DONE.

THAT GENERAL TILNEY, INSTEAD OF DISLIKING, SHOULD ADMIRE HER, WAS VERY
DELIGHTFUL; AND SHE JOYFULLY THOUGHT THAT THERE WAS NOT ONE OF THE
FAMILY WHOM SHE NEED NOW FEAR TO MEET. THE EVENING HAD DONE MORE, MUCH
MORE, FOR HER THAN COULD HAVE BEEN EXPECTED.




CHAPTER 13


MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY, AND SATURDAY HAVE NOW
PASSED IN REVIEW BEFORE THE READER; THE EVENTS OF EACH DAY, ITS HOPES
AND FEARS, MORTIFICATIONS AND PLEASURES, HAVE BEEN SEPARATELY STATED,
AND THE PANGS OF SUNDAY ONLY NOW REMAIN TO BE DESCRIBED, AND CLOSE THE
WEEK. THE CLIFTON SCHEME HAD BEEN DEFERRED, NOT RELINQUISHED, AND ON
THE AFTERNOON'S CRESCENT OF THIS DAY, IT WAS BROUGHT FORWARD AGAIN. IN A
PRIVATE CONSULTATION BETWEEN ISABELLA AND JAMES, THE FORMER OF WHOM HAD
PARTICULARLY SET HER HEART UPON GOING, AND THE LATTER NO LESS ANXIOUSLY
PLACED HIS UPON PLEASING HER, IT WAS AGREED THAT, PROVIDED THE WEATHER
WERE FAIR, THE PARTY SHOULD TAKE PLACE ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING; AND
THEY WERE TO SET OFF VERY EARLY, IN ORDER TO BE AT HOME IN GOOD TIME.
THE AFFAIR THUS DETERMINED, AND THORPE'S APPROBATION SECURED, CATHERINE
ONLY REMAINED TO BE APPRISED OF IT. SHE HAD LEFT THEM FOR A FEW MINUTES
TO SPEAK TO MISS TILNEY. IN THAT INTERVAL THE PLAN WAS COMPLETED, AND AS
SOON AS SHE CAME AGAIN, HER AGREEMENT WAS DEMANDED; BUT INSTEAD OF THE
GAY ACQUIESCENCE EXPECTED BY ISABELLA, CATHERINE LOOKED GRAVE, WAS VERY
SORRY, BUT COULD NOT GO. THE ENGAGEMENT WHICH OUGHT TO HAVE KEPT HER
FROM JOINING IN THE FORMER ATTEMPT WOULD MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR HER TO
ACCOMPANY THEM NOW. SHE HAD THAT MOMENT SETTLED WITH MISS TILNEY TO TAKE
THEIR PROPOSED WALK TOMORROW; IT WAS QUITE DETERMINED, AND SHE WOULD
NOT, UPON ANY ACCOUNT, RETRACT. BUT THAT SHE MUST AND SHOULD RETRACT
WAS INSTANTLY THE EAGER CRY OF BOTH THE THORPES; THEY MUST GO TO CLIFTON
TOMORROW, THEY WOULD NOT GO WITHOUT HER, IT WOULD BE NOTHING TO PUT OFF
A MERE WALK FOR ONE DAY LONGER, AND THEY WOULD NOT HEAR OF A REFUSAL.
CATHERINE WAS DISTRESSED, BUT NOT SUBDUED. "DO NOT URGE ME, ISABELLA. I
AM ENGAGED TO MISS TILNEY. I CANNOT GO." THIS AVAILED NOTHING. THE SAME
ARGUMENTS ASSAILED HER AGAIN; SHE MUST GO, SHE SHOULD GO, AND THEY WOULD
NOT HEAR OF A REFUSAL. "IT WOULD BE SO EASY TO TELL MISS TILNEY THAT YOU
HAD JUST BEEN REMINDED OF A PRIOR ENGAGEMENT, AND MUST ONLY BEG TO PUT
OFF THE WALK TILL TUESDAY."

"NO, IT WOULD NOT BE EASY. I COULD NOT DO IT. THERE HAS BEEN NO PRIOR
ENGAGEMENT." BUT ISABELLA BECAME ONLY MORE AND MORE URGENT, CALLING
ON HER IN THE MOST AFFECTIONATE MANNER, ADDRESSING HER BY THE MOST
ENDEARING NAMES. SHE WAS SURE HER DEAREST, SWEETEST CATHERINE WOULD NOT
SERIOUSLY REFUSE SUCH A TRIFLING REQUEST TO A FRIEND WHO LOVED HER SO
DEARLY. SHE KNEW HER BELOVED CATHERINE TO HAVE SO FEELING A HEART, SO
SWEET A TEMPER, TO BE SO EASILY PERSUADED BY THOSE SHE LOVED. BUT ALL
IN VAIN; CATHERINE FELT HERSELF TO BE IN THE RIGHT, AND THOUGH PAINED
BY SUCH TENDER, SUCH FLATTERING SUPPLICATION, COULD NOT ALLOW IT TO
INFLUENCE HER. ISABELLA THEN TRIED ANOTHER METHOD. SHE REPROACHED HER
WITH HAVING MORE AFFECTION FOR MISS TILNEY, THOUGH SHE HAD KNOWN HER SO
LITTLE A WHILE, THAN FOR HER BEST AND OLDEST FRIENDS, WITH BEING GROWN
COLD AND INDIFFERENT, IN SHORT, TOWARDS HERSELF. "I CANNOT HELP BEING
JEALOUS, CATHERINE, WHEN I SEE MYSELF SLIGHTED FOR STRANGERS, I, WHO
LOVE YOU SO EXCESSIVELY! WHEN ONCE MY AFFECTIONS ARE PLACED, IT IS NOT
IN THE POWER OF ANYTHING TO CHANGE THEM. BUT I BELIEVE MY FEELINGS ARE
STRONGER THAN ANYBODY'S; I AM SURE THEY ARE TOO STRONG FOR MY OWN PEACE;
AND TO SEE MYSELF SUPPLANTED IN YOUR FRIENDSHIP BY STRANGERS DOES CUT ME
TO THE QUICK, I OWN. THESE TILNEYS SEEM TO SWALLOW UP EVERYTHING ELSE."

CATHERINE THOUGHT THIS REPROACH EQUALLY STRANGE AND UNKIND. WAS IT THE
PART OF A FRIEND THUS TO EXPOSE HER FEELINGS TO THE NOTICE OF OTHERS?
ISABELLA APPEARED TO HER UNGENEROUS AND SELFISH, REGARDLESS OF
EVERYTHING BUT HER OWN GRATIFICATION. THESE PAINFUL IDEAS CROSSED HER
MIND, THOUGH SHE SAID NOTHING. ISABELLA, IN THE MEANWHILE, HAD APPLIED
HER HANDKERCHIEF TO HER EYES; AND MORLAND, MISERABLE AT SUCH A SIGHT,
COULD NOT HELP SAYING, "NAY, CATHERINE. I THINK YOU CANNOT STAND OUT ANY
LONGER NOW. THE SACRIFICE IS NOT MUCH; AND TO OBLIGE SUCH A FRIEND--I
SHALL THINK YOU QUITE UNKIND, IF YOU STILL REFUSE."

THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME OF HER BROTHER'S OPENLY SIDING AGAINST HER, AND
ANXIOUS TO AVOID HIS DISPLEASURE, SHE PROPOSED A COMPROMISE. IF THEY
WOULD ONLY PUT OFF THEIR SCHEME TILL TUESDAY, WHICH THEY MIGHT EASILY
DO, AS IT DEPENDED ONLY ON THEMSELVES, SHE COULD GO WITH THEM, AND
EVERYBODY MIGHT THEN BE SATISFIED. BUT "NO, NO, NO!" WAS THE IMMEDIATE
ANSWER; "THAT COULD NOT BE, FOR THORPE DID NOT KNOW THAT HE MIGHT NOT
GO TO TOWN ON TUESDAY." CATHERINE WAS SORRY, BUT COULD DO NO MORE; AND
A SHORT SILENCE ENSUED, WHICH WAS BROKEN BY ISABELLA, WHO IN A VOICE OF
COLD RESENTMENT SAID, "VERY WELL, THEN THERE IS AN END OF THE PARTY.
IF CATHERINE DOES NOT GO, I CANNOT. I CANNOT BE THE ONLY WOMAN. I WOULD
NOT, UPON ANY ACCOUNT IN THE WORLD, DO SO IMPROPER A THING."

"CATHERINE, YOU MUST GO," SAID JAMES.

"BUT WHY CANNOT MR. THORPE DRIVE ONE OF HIS OTHER SISTERS? I DARE SAY
EITHER OF THEM WOULD LIKE TO GO."

"THANK YE," CRIED THORPE, "BUT I DID NOT COME TO BATH TO DRIVE MY
SISTERS ABOUT, AND LOOK LIKE A FOOL. NO, IF YOU DO NOT GO, D---- ME IF I
DO. I ONLY GO FOR THE SAKE OF DRIVING YOU."

"THAT IS A COMPLIMENT WHICH GIVES ME NO PLEASURE." BUT HER WORDS WERE
LOST ON THORPE, WHO HAD TURNED ABRUPTLY AWAY.

THE THREE OTHERS STILL CONTINUED TOGETHER, WALKING IN A MOST
UNCOMFORTABLE MANNER TO POOR CATHERINE; SOMETIMES NOT A WORD WAS SAID,
SOMETIMES SHE WAS AGAIN ATTACKED WITH SUPPLICATIONS OR REPROACHES, AND
HER ARM WAS STILL LINKED WITHIN ISABELLA'S, THOUGH THEIR HEARTS WERE
AT WAR. AT ONE MOMENT SHE WAS SOFTENED, AT ANOTHER IRRITATED; ALWAYS
DISTRESSED, BUT ALWAYS STEADY.

"I DID NOT THINK YOU HAD BEEN SO OBSTINATE, CATHERINE," SAID JAMES;
"YOU WERE NOT USED TO BE SO HARD TO PERSUADE; YOU ONCE WERE THE KINDEST,
BEST-TEMPERED OF MY SISTERS."

"I HOPE I AM NOT LESS SO NOW," SHE REPLIED, VERY FEELINGLY; "BUT INDEED
I CANNOT GO. IF I AM WRONG, I AM DOING WHAT I BELIEVE TO BE RIGHT."

"I SUSPECT," SAID ISABELLA, IN A LOW VOICE, "THERE IS NO GREAT
STRUGGLE."

CATHERINE'S HEART SWELLED; SHE DREW AWAY HER ARM, AND ISABELLA MADE NO
OPPOSITION. THUS PASSED A LONG TEN MINUTES, TILL THEY WERE AGAIN JOINED
BY THORPE, WHO, COMING TO THEM WITH A GAYER LOOK, SAID, "WELL, I
HAVE SETTLED THE MATTER, AND NOW WE MAY ALL GO TOMORROW WITH A SAFE
CONSCIENCE. I HAVE BEEN TO MISS TILNEY, AND MADE YOUR EXCUSES."

"YOU HAVE NOT!" CRIED CATHERINE.

"I HAVE, UPON MY SOUL. LEFT HER THIS MOMENT. TOLD HER YOU HAD SENT ME TO
SAY THAT, HAVING JUST RECOLLECTED A PRIOR ENGAGEMENT OF GOING TO CLIFTON
WITH US TOMORROW, YOU COULD NOT HAVE THE PLEASURE OF WALKING WITH HER
TILL TUESDAY. SHE SAID VERY WELL, TUESDAY WAS JUST AS CONVENIENT TO HER;
SO THERE IS AN END OF ALL OUR DIFFICULTIES. A PRETTY GOOD THOUGHT OF
MINE--HEY?"

ISABELLA'S COUNTENANCE WAS ONCE MORE ALL SMILES AND GOOD HUMOUR, AND
JAMES TOO LOOKED HAPPY AGAIN.

"A MOST HEAVENLY THOUGHT INDEED! NOW, MY SWEET CATHERINE, ALL OUR
DISTRESSES ARE OVER; YOU ARE HONOURABLY ACQUITTED, AND WE SHALL HAVE A
MOST DELIGHTFUL PARTY."

"THIS WILL NOT DO," SAID CATHERINE; "I CANNOT SUBMIT TO THIS. I MUST RUN
AFTER MISS TILNEY DIRECTLY AND SET HER RIGHT."

ISABELLA, HOWEVER, CAUGHT HOLD OF ONE HAND, THORPE OF THE OTHER, AND
REMONSTRANCES POURED IN FROM ALL THREE. EVEN JAMES WAS QUITE ANGRY. WHEN
EVERYTHING WAS SETTLED, WHEN MISS TILNEY HERSELF SAID THAT TUESDAY WOULD
SUIT HER AS WELL, IT WAS QUITE RIDICULOUS, QUITE ABSURD, TO MAKE ANY
FURTHER OBJECTION.

"I DO NOT CARE. MR. THORPE HAD NO BUSINESS TO INVENT ANY SUCH MESSAGE.
IF I HAD THOUGHT IT RIGHT TO PUT IT OFF, I COULD HAVE SPOKEN TO MISS
TILNEY MYSELF. THIS IS ONLY DOING IT IN A RUDER WAY; AND HOW DO I KNOW
THAT MR. THORPE HAS--HE MAY BE MISTAKEN AGAIN PERHAPS; HE LED ME INTO
ONE ACT OF RUDENESS BY HIS MISTAKE ON FRIDAY. LET ME GO, MR. THORPE;
ISABELLA, DO NOT HOLD ME."

THORPE TOLD HER IT WOULD BE IN VAIN TO GO AFTER THE TILNEYS; THEY WERE
TURNING THE CORNER INTO BROCK STREET, WHEN HE HAD OVERTAKEN THEM, AND
WERE AT HOME BY THIS TIME.

"THEN I WILL GO AFTER THEM," SAID CATHERINE; "WHEREVER THEY ARE I WILL
GO AFTER THEM. IT DOES NOT SIGNIFY TALKING. IF I COULD NOT BE PERSUADED
INTO DOING WHAT I THOUGHT WRONG, I NEVER WILL BE TRICKED INTO IT."
AND WITH THESE WORDS SHE BROKE AWAY AND HURRIED OFF. THORPE WOULD HAVE
DARTED AFTER HER, BUT MORLAND WITHHELD HIM. "LET HER GO, LET HER GO, IF
SHE WILL GO. SHE IS AS OBSTINATE AS--"

THORPE NEVER FINISHED THE SIMILE, FOR IT COULD HARDLY HAVE BEEN A PROPER
ONE.

AWAY WALKED CATHERINE IN GREAT AGITATION, AS FAST AS THE CROWD WOULD
PERMIT HER, FEARFUL OF BEING PURSUED, YET DETERMINED TO PERSEVERE. AS
SHE WALKED, SHE REFLECTED ON WHAT HAD PASSED. IT WAS PAINFUL TO HER TO
DISAPPOINT AND DISPLEASE THEM, PARTICULARLY TO DISPLEASE HER BROTHER;
BUT SHE COULD NOT REPENT HER RESISTANCE. SETTING HER OWN INCLINATION
APART, TO HAVE FAILED A SECOND TIME IN HER ENGAGEMENT TO MISS TILNEY, TO
HAVE RETRACTED A PROMISE VOLUNTARILY MADE ONLY FIVE MINUTES BEFORE,
AND ON A FALSE PRETENCE TOO, MUST HAVE BEEN WRONG. SHE HAD NOT BEEN
WITHSTANDING THEM ON SELFISH PRINCIPLES ALONE, SHE HAD NOT CONSULTED
MERELY HER OWN GRATIFICATION; THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN ENSURED IN SOME
DEGREE BY THE EXCURSION ITSELF, BY SEEING BLAIZE CASTLE; NO, SHE HAD
ATTENDED TO WHAT WAS DUE TO OTHERS, AND TO HER OWN CHARACTER IN THEIR
OPINION. HER CONVICTION OF BEING RIGHT, HOWEVER, WAS NOT ENOUGH TO
RESTORE HER COMPOSURE; TILL SHE HAD SPOKEN TO MISS TILNEY SHE COULD NOT
BE AT EASE; AND QUICKENING HER PACE WHEN SHE GOT CLEAR OF THE CRESCENT,
SHE ALMOST RAN OVER THE REMAINING GROUND TILL SHE GAINED THE TOP OF
MILSOM STREET. SO RAPID HAD BEEN HER MOVEMENTS THAT IN SPITE OF THE
TILNEYS' ADVANTAGE IN THE OUTSET, THEY WERE BUT JUST TURNING INTO
THEIR LODGINGS AS SHE CAME WITHIN VIEW OF THEM; AND THE SERVANT STILL
REMAINING AT THE OPEN DOOR, SHE USED ONLY THE CEREMONY OF SAYING
THAT SHE MUST SPEAK WITH MISS TILNEY THAT MOMENT, AND HURRYING BY HIM
PROCEEDED UPSTAIRS. THEN, OPENING THE FIRST DOOR BEFORE HER, WHICH
HAPPENED TO BE THE RIGHT, SHE IMMEDIATELY FOUND HERSELF IN THE
DRAWING-ROOM WITH GENERAL TILNEY, HIS SON, AND DAUGHTER. HER
EXPLANATION, DEFECTIVE ONLY IN BEING--FROM HER IRRITATION OF NERVES AND
SHORTNESS OF BREATH--NO EXPLANATION AT ALL, WAS INSTANTLY GIVEN. "I AM
COME IN A GREAT HURRY--IT WAS ALL A MISTAKE--I NEVER PROMISED TO GO--I
TOLD THEM FROM THE FIRST I COULD NOT GO.--I RAN AWAY IN A GREAT HURRY
TO EXPLAIN IT.--I DID NOT CARE WHAT YOU THOUGHT OF ME.--I WOULD NOT STAY
FOR THE SERVANT."

THE BUSINESS, HOWEVER, THOUGH NOT PERFECTLY ELUCIDATED BY THIS SPEECH,
SOON CEASED TO BE A PUZZLE. CATHERINE FOUND THAT JOHN THORPE HAD GIVEN
THE MESSAGE; AND MISS TILNEY HAD NO SCRUPLE IN OWNING HERSELF GREATLY
SURPRISED BY IT. BUT WHETHER HER BROTHER HAD STILL EXCEEDED HER IN
RESENTMENT, CATHERINE, THOUGH SHE INSTINCTIVELY ADDRESSED HERSELF AS
MUCH TO ONE AS TO THE OTHER IN HER VINDICATION, HAD NO MEANS OF KNOWING.
WHATEVER MIGHT HAVE BEEN FELT BEFORE HER ARRIVAL, HER EAGER DECLARATIONS
IMMEDIATELY MADE EVERY LOOK AND SENTENCE AS FRIENDLY AS SHE COULD
DESIRE.

THE AFFAIR THUS HAPPILY SETTLED, SHE WAS INTRODUCED BY MISS TILNEY
TO HER FATHER, AND RECEIVED BY HIM WITH SUCH READY, SUCH SOLICITOUS
POLITENESS AS RECALLED THORPE'S INFORMATION TO HER MIND, AND MADE HER
THINK WITH PLEASURE THAT HE MIGHT BE SOMETIMES DEPENDED ON. TO SUCH
ANXIOUS ATTENTION WAS THE GENERAL'S CIVILITY CARRIED, THAT NOT AWARE OF
HER EXTRAORDINARY SWIFTNESS IN ENTERING THE HOUSE, HE WAS QUITE ANGRY
WITH THE SERVANT WHOSE NEGLECT HAD REDUCED HER TO OPEN THE DOOR OF THE
APARTMENT HERSELF. "WHAT DID WILLIAM MEAN BY IT? HE SHOULD MAKE A POINT
OF INQUIRING INTO THE MATTER." AND IF CATHERINE HAD NOT MOST WARMLY
ASSERTED HIS INNOCENCE, IT SEEMED LIKELY THAT WILLIAM WOULD LOSE THE
FAVOUR OF HIS MASTER FOREVER, IF NOT HIS PLACE, BY HER RAPIDITY.

AFTER SITTING WITH THEM A QUARTER OF AN HOUR, SHE ROSE TO TAKE LEAVE,
AND WAS THEN MOST AGREEABLY SURPRISED BY GENERAL TILNEY'S ASKING HER IF
SHE WOULD DO HIS DAUGHTER THE HONOUR OF DINING AND SPENDING THE REST
OF THE DAY WITH HER. MISS TILNEY ADDED HER OWN WISHES. CATHERINE WAS
GREATLY OBLIGED; BUT IT WAS QUITE OUT OF HER POWER. MR. AND MRS. ALLEN
WOULD EXPECT HER BACK EVERY MOMENT. THE GENERAL DECLARED HE COULD SAY NO
MORE; THE CLAIMS OF MR. AND MRS. ALLEN WERE NOT TO BE SUPERSEDED; BUT ON
SOME OTHER DAY HE TRUSTED, WHEN LONGER NOTICE COULD BE GIVEN, THEY WOULD
NOT REFUSE TO SPARE HER TO HER FRIEND. "OH, NO; CATHERINE WAS SURE THEY
WOULD NOT HAVE THE LEAST OBJECTION, AND SHE SHOULD HAVE GREAT PLEASURE
IN COMING." THE GENERAL ATTENDED HER HIMSELF TO THE STREET-DOOR, SAYING
EVERYTHING GALLANT AS THEY WENT DOWNSTAIRS, ADMIRING THE ELASTICITY OF
HER WALK, WHICH CORRESPONDED EXACTLY WITH THE SPIRIT OF HER DANCING, AND
MAKING HER ONE OF THE MOST GRACEFUL BOWS SHE HAD EVER BEHELD, WHEN THEY
PARTED.

CATHERINE, DELIGHTED BY ALL THAT HAD PASSED, PROCEEDED GAILY TO PULTENEY
STREET, WALKING, AS SHE CONCLUDED, WITH GREAT ELASTICITY, THOUGH SHE
HAD NEVER THOUGHT OF IT BEFORE. SHE REACHED HOME WITHOUT SEEING ANYTHING
MORE OF THE OFFENDED PARTY; AND NOW THAT SHE HAD BEEN TRIUMPHANT
THROUGHOUT, HAD CARRIED HER POINT, AND WAS SECURE OF HER WALK, SHE BEGAN
(AS THE FLUTTER OF HER SPIRITS SUBSIDED) TO DOUBT WHETHER SHE HAD BEEN
PERFECTLY RIGHT. A SACRIFICE WAS ALWAYS NOBLE; AND IF SHE HAD GIVEN WAY
TO THEIR ENTREATIES, SHE SHOULD HAVE BEEN SPARED THE DISTRESSING IDEA OF
A FRIEND DISPLEASED, A BROTHER ANGRY, AND A SCHEME OF GREAT HAPPINESS
TO BOTH DESTROYED, PERHAPS THROUGH HER MEANS. TO EASE HER MIND, AND
ASCERTAIN BY THE OPINION OF AN UNPREJUDICED PERSON WHAT HER OWN CONDUCT
HAD REALLY BEEN, SHE TOOK OCCASION TO MENTION BEFORE MR. ALLEN THE
HALF-SETTLED SCHEME OF HER BROTHER AND THE THORPES FOR THE FOLLOWING
DAY. MR. ALLEN CAUGHT AT IT DIRECTLY. "WELL," SAID HE, "AND DO YOU THINK
OF GOING TOO?"

"NO; I HAD JUST ENGAGED MYSELF TO WALK WITH MISS TILNEY BEFORE THEY TOLD
ME OF IT; AND THEREFORE YOU KNOW I COULD NOT GO WITH THEM, COULD I?"

"NO, CERTAINLY NOT; AND I AM GLAD YOU DO NOT THINK OF IT. THESE SCHEMES
ARE NOT AT ALL THE THING. YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN DRIVING ABOUT THE COUNTRY
IN OPEN CARRIAGES! NOW AND THEN IT IS VERY WELL; BUT GOING TO INNS AND
PUBLIC PLACES TOGETHER! IT IS NOT RIGHT; AND I WONDER MRS. THORPE SHOULD
ALLOW IT. I AM GLAD YOU DO NOT THINK OF GOING; I AM SURE MRS. MORLAND
WOULD NOT BE PLEASED. MRS. ALLEN, ARE NOT YOU OF MY WAY OF THINKING? DO
NOT YOU THINK THESE KIND OF PROJECTS OBJECTIONABLE?"

"YES, VERY MUCH SO INDEED. OPEN CARRIAGES ARE NASTY THINGS. A CLEAN
GOWN IS NOT FIVE MINUTES' WEAR IN THEM. YOU ARE SPLASHED GETTING IN
AND GETTING OUT; AND THE WIND TAKES YOUR HAIR AND YOUR BONNET IN EVERY
DIRECTION. I HATE AN OPEN CARRIAGE MYSELF."

"I KNOW YOU DO; BUT THAT IS NOT THE QUESTION. DO NOT YOU THINK IT HAS AN
ODD APPEARANCE, IF YOUNG LADIES ARE FREQUENTLY DRIVEN ABOUT IN THEM BY
YOUNG MEN, TO WHOM THEY ARE NOT EVEN RELATED?"

"YES, MY DEAR, A VERY ODD APPEARANCE INDEED. I CANNOT BEAR TO SEE IT."

"DEAR MADAM," CRIED CATHERINE, "THEN WHY DID NOT YOU TELL ME SO BEFORE?
I AM SURE IF I HAD KNOWN IT TO BE IMPROPER, I WOULD NOT HAVE GONE WITH
MR. THORPE AT ALL; BUT I ALWAYS HOPED YOU WOULD TELL ME, IF YOU THOUGHT
I WAS DOING WRONG."

"AND SO I SHOULD, MY DEAR, YOU MAY DEPEND ON IT; FOR AS I TOLD MRS.
MORLAND AT PARTING, I WOULD ALWAYS DO THE BEST FOR YOU IN MY POWER. BUT
ONE MUST NOT BE OVER PARTICULAR. YOUNG PEOPLE WILL BE YOUNG PEOPLE,
AS YOUR GOOD MOTHER SAYS HERSELF. YOU KNOW I WANTED YOU, WHEN WE FIRST
CAME, NOT TO BUY THAT SPRIGGED MUSLIN, BUT YOU WOULD. YOUNG PEOPLE DO
NOT LIKE TO BE ALWAYS THWARTED."

"BUT THIS WAS SOMETHING OF REAL CONSEQUENCE; AND I DO NOT THINK YOU
WOULD HAVE FOUND ME HARD TO PERSUADE."

"AS FAR AS IT HAS GONE HITHERTO, THERE IS NO HARM DONE," SAID MR. ALLEN;
"AND I WOULD ONLY ADVISE YOU, MY DEAR, NOT TO GO OUT WITH MR. THORPE ANY
MORE."

"THAT IS JUST WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY," ADDED HIS WIFE.

CATHERINE, RELIEVED FOR HERSELF, FELT UNEASY FOR ISABELLA, AND AFTER A
MOMENT'S THOUGHT, ASKED MR. ALLEN WHETHER IT WOULD NOT BE BOTH PROPER
AND KIND IN HER TO WRITE TO MISS THORPE, AND EXPLAIN THE INDECORUM OF
WHICH SHE MUST BE AS INSENSIBLE AS HERSELF; FOR SHE CONSIDERED THAT
ISABELLA MIGHT OTHERWISE PERHAPS BE GOING TO CLIFTON THE NEXT DAY, IN
SPITE OF WHAT HAD PASSED. MR. ALLEN, HOWEVER, DISCOURAGED HER FROM DOING
ANY SUCH THING. "YOU HAD BETTER LEAVE HER ALONE, MY DEAR; SHE IS OLD
ENOUGH TO KNOW WHAT SHE IS ABOUT, AND IF NOT, HAS A MOTHER TO ADVISE
HER. MRS. THORPE IS TOO INDULGENT BEYOND A DOUBT; BUT, HOWEVER, YOU HAD
BETTER NOT INTERFERE. SHE AND YOUR BROTHER CHOOSE TO GO, AND YOU WILL BE
ONLY GETTING ILL WILL."

CATHERINE SUBMITTED, AND THOUGH SORRY TO THINK THAT ISABELLA SHOULD BE
DOING WRONG, FELT GREATLY RELIEVED BY MR. ALLEN'S APPROBATION OF HER
OWN CONDUCT, AND TRULY REJOICED TO BE PRESERVED BY HIS ADVICE FROM THE
DANGER OF FALLING INTO SUCH AN ERROR HERSELF. HER ESCAPE FROM BEING ONE
OF THE PARTY TO CLIFTON WAS NOW AN ESCAPE INDEED; FOR WHAT WOULD THE
TILNEYS HAVE THOUGHT OF HER, IF SHE HAD BROKEN HER PROMISE TO THEM IN
ORDER TO DO WHAT WAS WRONG IN ITSELF, IF SHE HAD BEEN GUILTY OF ONE
BREACH OF PROPRIETY, ONLY TO ENABLE HER TO BE GUILTY OF ANOTHER?




CHAPTER 14


THE NEXT MORNING WAS FAIR, AND CATHERINE ALMOST EXPECTED ANOTHER ATTACK
FROM THE ASSEMBLED PARTY. WITH MR. ALLEN TO SUPPORT HER, SHE FELT NO
DREAD OF THE EVENT: BUT SHE WOULD GLADLY BE SPARED A CONTEST, WHERE
VICTORY ITSELF WAS PAINFUL, AND WAS HEARTILY REJOICED THEREFORE AT
NEITHER SEEING NOR HEARING ANYTHING OF THEM. THE TILNEYS CALLED FOR
HER AT THE APPOINTED TIME; AND NO NEW DIFFICULTY ARISING, NO SUDDEN
RECOLLECTION, NO UNEXPECTED SUMMONS, NO IMPERTINENT INTRUSION TO
DISCONCERT THEIR MEASURES, MY HEROINE WAS MOST UNNATURALLY ABLE TO
FULFIL HER ENGAGEMENT, THOUGH IT WAS MADE WITH THE HERO HIMSELF.
THEY DETERMINED ON WALKING ROUND BEECHEN CLIFF, THAT NOBLE HILL WHOSE
BEAUTIFUL VERDURE AND HANGING COPPICE RENDER IT SO STRIKING AN OBJECT
FROM ALMOST EVERY OPENING IN BATH.

"I NEVER LOOK AT IT," SAID CATHERINE, AS THEY WALKED ALONG THE SIDE OF
THE RIVER, "WITHOUT THINKING OF THE SOUTH OF FRANCE."

"YOU HAVE BEEN ABROAD THEN?" SAID HENRY, A LITTLE SURPRISED.

"OH! NO, I ONLY MEAN WHAT I HAVE READ ABOUT. IT ALWAYS PUTS ME IN MIND
OF THE COUNTRY THAT EMILY AND HER FATHER TRAVELLED THROUGH, IN THE
MYSTERIES OF UDOLPHO. BUT YOU NEVER READ NOVELS, I DARE SAY?"

"WHY NOT?"

"BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT CLEVER ENOUGH FOR YOU--GENTLEMEN READ BETTER
BOOKS."

"THE PERSON, BE IT GENTLEMAN OR LADY, WHO HAS NOT PLEASURE IN A GOOD
NOVEL, MUST BE INTOLERABLY STUPID. I HAVE READ ALL MRS. RADCLIFFE'S
WORKS, AND MOST OF THEM WITH GREAT PLEASURE. THE MYSTERIES OF UDOLPHO,
WHEN I HAD ONCE BEGUN IT, I COULD NOT LAY DOWN AGAIN; I REMEMBER
FINISHING IT IN TWO DAYS--MY HAIR STANDING ON END THE WHOLE TIME."

"YES," ADDED MISS TILNEY, "AND I REMEMBER THAT YOU UNDERTOOK TO READ IT
ALOUD TO ME, AND THAT WHEN I WAS CALLED AWAY FOR ONLY FIVE MINUTES TO
ANSWER A NOTE, INSTEAD OF WAITING FOR ME, YOU TOOK THE VOLUME INTO THE
HERMITAGE WALK, AND I WAS OBLIGED TO STAY TILL YOU HAD FINISHED IT."

"THANK YOU, ELEANOR--A MOST HONOURABLE TESTIMONY. YOU SEE, MISS MORLAND,
THE INJUSTICE OF YOUR SUSPICIONS. HERE WAS I, IN MY EAGERNESS TO GET ON,
REFUSING TO WAIT ONLY FIVE MINUTES FOR MY SISTER, BREAKING THE PROMISE
I HAD MADE OF READING IT ALOUD, AND KEEPING HER IN SUSPENSE AT A MOST
INTERESTING PART, BY RUNNING AWAY WITH THE VOLUME, WHICH, YOU ARE TO
OBSERVE, WAS HER OWN, PARTICULARLY HER OWN. I AM PROUD WHEN I REFLECT ON
IT, AND I THINK IT MUST ESTABLISH ME IN YOUR GOOD OPINION."

"I AM VERY GLAD TO HEAR IT INDEED, AND NOW I SHALL NEVER BE ASHAMED OF
LIKING UDOLPHO MYSELF. BUT I REALLY THOUGHT BEFORE, YOUNG MEN DESPISED
NOVELS AMAZINGLY."

"IT IS AMAZINGLY; IT MAY WELL SUGGEST AMAZEMENT IF THEY DO--FOR THEY
READ NEARLY AS MANY AS WOMEN. I MYSELF HAVE READ HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS.
DO NOT IMAGINE THAT YOU CAN COPE WITH ME IN A KNOWLEDGE OF JULIAS AND
LOUISAS. IF WE PROCEED TO PARTICULARS, AND ENGAGE IN THE NEVER-CEASING
INQUIRY OF 'HAVE YOU READ THIS?' AND 'HAVE YOU READ THAT?' I SHALL SOON
LEAVE YOU AS FAR BEHIND ME AS--WHAT SHALL I SAY?--I WANT AN APPROPRIATE
SIMILE.--AS FAR AS YOUR FRIEND EMILY HERSELF LEFT POOR VALANCOURT WHEN
SHE WENT WITH HER AUNT INTO ITALY. CONSIDER HOW MANY YEARS I HAVE HAD
THE START OF YOU. I HAD ENTERED ON MY STUDIES AT OXFORD, WHILE YOU WERE
A GOOD LITTLE GIRL WORKING YOUR SAMPLER AT HOME!"

"NOT VERY GOOD, I AM AFRAID. BUT NOW REALLY, DO NOT YOU THINK UDOLPHO
THE NICEST BOOK IN THE WORLD?"

"THE NICEST--BY WHICH I SUPPOSE YOU MEAN THE NEATEST. THAT MUST DEPEND
UPON THE BINDING."

"HENRY," SAID MISS TILNEY, "YOU ARE VERY IMPERTINENT. MISS MORLAND, HE
IS TREATING YOU EXACTLY AS HE DOES HIS SISTER. HE IS FOREVER FINDING
FAULT WITH ME, FOR SOME INCORRECTNESS OF LANGUAGE, AND NOW HE IS TAKING
THE SAME LIBERTY WITH YOU. THE WORD 'NICEST,' AS YOU USED IT, DID NOT
SUIT HIM; AND YOU HAD BETTER CHANGE IT AS SOON AS YOU CAN, OR WE SHALL
BE OVERPOWERED WITH JOHNSON AND BLAIR ALL THE REST OF THE WAY."

"I AM SURE," CRIED CATHERINE, "I DID NOT MEAN TO SAY ANYTHING WRONG; BUT
IT IS A NICE BOOK, AND WHY SHOULD NOT I CALL IT SO?"

"VERY TRUE," SAID HENRY, "AND THIS IS A VERY NICE DAY, AND WE ARE TAKING
A VERY NICE WALK, AND YOU ARE TWO VERY NICE YOUNG LADIES. OH! IT IS A
VERY NICE WORD INDEED! IT DOES FOR EVERYTHING. ORIGINALLY PERHAPS IT
WAS APPLIED ONLY TO EXPRESS NEATNESS, PROPRIETY, DELICACY, OR
REFINEMENT--PEOPLE WERE NICE IN THEIR DRESS, IN THEIR SENTIMENTS, OR
THEIR CHOICE. BUT NOW EVERY COMMENDATION ON EVERY SUBJECT IS COMPRISED
IN THAT ONE WORD."

"WHILE, IN FACT," CRIED HIS SISTER, "IT OUGHT ONLY TO BE APPLIED TO YOU,
WITHOUT ANY COMMENDATION AT ALL. YOU ARE MORE NICE THAN WISE. COME,
MISS MORLAND, LET US LEAVE HIM TO MEDITATE OVER OUR FAULTS IN THE UTMOST
PROPRIETY OF DICTION, WHILE WE PRAISE UDOLPHO IN WHATEVER TERMS WE
LIKE BEST. IT IS A MOST INTERESTING WORK. YOU ARE FOND OF THAT KIND OF
READING?"

"TO SAY THE TRUTH, I DO NOT MUCH LIKE ANY OTHER."

"INDEED!"

"THAT IS, I CAN READ POETRY AND PLAYS, AND THINGS OF THAT SORT, AND
DO NOT DISLIKE TRAVELS. BUT HISTORY, REAL SOLEMN HISTORY, I CANNOT BE
INTERESTED IN. CAN YOU?"

"YES, I AM FOND OF HISTORY."

"I WISH I WERE TOO. I READ IT A LITTLE AS A DUTY, BUT IT TELLS ME
NOTHING THAT DOES NOT EITHER VEX OR WEARY ME. THE QUARRELS OF POPES AND
KINGS, WITH WARS OR PESTILENCES, IN EVERY PAGE; THE MEN ALL SO GOOD FOR
NOTHING, AND HARDLY ANY WOMEN AT ALL--IT IS VERY TIRESOME: AND YET I
OFTEN THINK IT ODD THAT IT SHOULD BE SO DULL, FOR A GREAT DEAL OF IT
MUST BE INVENTION. THE SPEECHES THAT ARE PUT INTO THE HEROES' MOUTHS,
THEIR THOUGHTS AND DESIGNS--THE CHIEF OF ALL THIS MUST BE INVENTION, AND
INVENTION IS WHAT DELIGHTS ME IN OTHER BOOKS."

"HISTORIANS, YOU THINK," SAID MISS TILNEY, "ARE NOT HAPPY IN THEIR
FLIGHTS OF FANCY. THEY DISPLAY IMAGINATION WITHOUT RAISING INTEREST. I
AM FOND OF HISTORY--AND AM VERY WELL CONTENTED TO TAKE THE FALSE WITH
THE TRUE. IN THE PRINCIPAL FACTS THEY HAVE SOURCES OF INTELLIGENCE
IN FORMER HISTORIES AND RECORDS, WHICH MAY BE AS MUCH DEPENDED ON,
I CONCLUDE, AS ANYTHING THAT DOES NOT ACTUALLY PASS UNDER ONE'S OWN
OBSERVATION; AND AS FOR THE LITTLE EMBELLISHMENTS YOU SPEAK OF, THEY ARE
EMBELLISHMENTS, AND I LIKE THEM AS SUCH. IF A SPEECH BE WELL DRAWN UP,
I READ IT WITH PLEASURE, BY WHOMSOEVER IT MAY BE MADE--AND PROBABLY WITH
MUCH GREATER, IF THE PRODUCTION OF MR. HUME OR MR. ROBERTSON, THAN IF
THE GENUINE WORDS OF CARACTACUS, AGRICOLA, OR ALFRED THE GREAT."

"YOU ARE FOND OF HISTORY! AND SO ARE MR. ALLEN AND MY FATHER; AND I HAVE
TWO BROTHERS WHO DO NOT DISLIKE IT. SO MANY INSTANCES WITHIN MY SMALL
CIRCLE OF FRIENDS IS REMARKABLE! AT THIS RATE, I SHALL NOT PITY THE
WRITERS OF HISTORY ANY LONGER. IF PEOPLE LIKE TO READ THEIR BOOKS, IT
IS ALL VERY WELL, BUT TO BE AT SO MUCH TROUBLE IN FILLING GREAT VOLUMES,
WHICH, AS I USED TO THINK, NOBODY WOULD WILLINGLY EVER LOOK INTO, TO BE
LABOURING ONLY FOR THE TORMENT OF LITTLE BOYS AND GIRLS, ALWAYS STRUCK
ME AS A HARD FATE; AND THOUGH I KNOW IT IS ALL VERY RIGHT AND NECESSARY,
I HAVE OFTEN WONDERED AT THE PERSON'S COURAGE THAT COULD SIT DOWN ON
PURPOSE TO DO IT."

"THAT LITTLE BOYS AND GIRLS SHOULD BE TORMENTED," SAID HENRY, "IS WHAT
NO ONE AT ALL ACQUAINTED WITH HUMAN NATURE IN A CIVILIZED STATE CAN
DENY; BUT IN BEHALF OF OUR MOST DISTINGUISHED HISTORIANS, I MUST OBSERVE
THAT THEY MIGHT WELL BE OFFENDED AT BEING SUPPOSED TO HAVE NO HIGHER
AIM, AND THAT BY THEIR METHOD AND STYLE, THEY ARE PERFECTLY WELL
QUALIFIED TO TORMENT READERS OF THE MOST ADVANCED REASON AND MATURE
TIME OF LIFE. I USE THE VERB 'TO TORMENT,' AS I OBSERVED TO BE YOUR OWN
METHOD, INSTEAD OF 'TO INSTRUCT,' SUPPOSING THEM TO BE NOW ADMITTED AS
SYNONYMOUS."

"YOU THINK ME FOOLISH TO CALL INSTRUCTION A TORMENT, BUT IF YOU HAD BEEN
AS MUCH USED AS MYSELF TO HEAR POOR LITTLE CHILDREN FIRST LEARNING THEIR
LETTERS AND THEN LEARNING TO SPELL, IF YOU HAD EVER SEEN HOW STUPID THEY
CAN BE FOR A WHOLE MORNING TOGETHER, AND HOW TIRED MY POOR MOTHER IS
AT THE END OF IT, AS I AM IN THE HABIT OF SEEING ALMOST EVERY DAY OF MY
LIFE AT HOME, YOU WOULD ALLOW THAT 'TO TORMENT' AND 'TO INSTRUCT' MIGHT
SOMETIMES BE USED AS SYNONYMOUS WORDS."

"VERY PROBABLY. BUT HISTORIANS ARE NOT ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE DIFFICULTY
OF LEARNING TO READ; AND EVEN YOU YOURSELF, WHO DO NOT ALTOGETHER SEEM
PARTICULARLY FRIENDLY TO VERY SEVERE, VERY INTENSE APPLICATION, MAY
PERHAPS BE BROUGHT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IT IS VERY WELL WORTH-WHILE TO
BE TORMENTED FOR TWO OR THREE YEARS OF ONE'S LIFE, FOR THE SAKE OF
BEING ABLE TO READ ALL THE REST OF IT. CONSIDER--IF READING HAD NOT BEEN
TAUGHT, MRS. RADCLIFFE WOULD HAVE WRITTEN IN VAIN--OR PERHAPS MIGHT NOT
HAVE WRITTEN AT ALL."

CATHERINE ASSENTED--AND A VERY WARM PANEGYRIC FROM HER ON THAT LADY'S
MERITS CLOSED THE SUBJECT. THE TILNEYS WERE SOON ENGAGED IN ANOTHER ON
WHICH SHE HAD NOTHING TO SAY. THEY WERE VIEWING THE COUNTRY WITH THE
EYES OF PERSONS ACCUSTOMED TO DRAWING, AND DECIDED ON ITS CAPABILITY OF
BEING FORMED INTO PICTURES, WITH ALL THE EAGERNESS OF REAL TASTE. HERE
CATHERINE WAS QUITE LOST. SHE KNEW NOTHING OF DRAWING--NOTHING OF TASTE:
AND SHE LISTENED TO THEM WITH AN ATTENTION WHICH BROUGHT HER LITTLE
PROFIT, FOR THEY TALKED IN PHRASES WHICH CONVEYED SCARCELY ANY IDEA
TO HER. THE LITTLE WHICH SHE COULD UNDERSTAND, HOWEVER, APPEARED TO
CONTRADICT THE VERY FEW NOTIONS SHE HAD ENTERTAINED ON THE MATTER
BEFORE. IT SEEMED AS IF A GOOD VIEW WERE NO LONGER TO BE TAKEN FROM THE
TOP OF AN HIGH HILL, AND THAT A CLEAR BLUE SKY WAS NO LONGER A PROOF
OF A FINE DAY. SHE WAS HEARTILY ASHAMED OF HER IGNORANCE. A MISPLACED
SHAME. WHERE PEOPLE WISH TO ATTACH, THEY SHOULD ALWAYS BE IGNORANT.
TO COME WITH A WELL-INFORMED MIND IS TO COME WITH AN INABILITY OF
ADMINISTERING TO THE VANITY OF OTHERS, WHICH A SENSIBLE PERSON WOULD
ALWAYS WISH TO AVOID. A WOMAN ESPECIALLY, IF SHE HAVE THE MISFORTUNE OF
KNOWING ANYTHING, SHOULD CONCEAL IT AS WELL AS SHE CAN.

THE ADVANTAGES OF NATURAL FOLLY IN A BEAUTIFUL GIRL HAVE BEEN ALREADY
SET FORTH BY THE CAPITAL PEN OF A SISTER AUTHOR; AND TO HER TREATMENT
OF THE SUBJECT I WILL ONLY ADD, IN JUSTICE TO MEN, THAT THOUGH TO THE
LARGER AND MORE TRIFLING PART OF THE SEX, IMBECILITY IN FEMALES IS A
GREAT ENHANCEMENT OF THEIR PERSONAL CHARMS, THERE IS A PORTION OF THEM
TOO REASONABLE AND TOO WELL INFORMED THEMSELVES TO DESIRE ANYTHING
MORE IN WOMAN THAN IGNORANCE. BUT CATHERINE DID NOT KNOW HER OWN
ADVANTAGES--DID NOT KNOW THAT A GOOD-LOOKING GIRL, WITH AN AFFECTIONATE
HEART AND A VERY IGNORANT MIND, CANNOT FAIL OF ATTRACTING A CLEVER YOUNG
MAN, UNLESS CIRCUMSTANCES ARE PARTICULARLY UNTOWARD. IN THE PRESENT
INSTANCE, SHE CONFESSED AND LAMENTED HER WANT OF KNOWLEDGE, DECLARED
THAT SHE WOULD GIVE ANYTHING IN THE WORLD TO BE ABLE TO DRAW; AND
A LECTURE ON THE PICTURESQUE IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED, IN WHICH HIS
INSTRUCTIONS WERE SO CLEAR THAT SHE SOON BEGAN TO SEE BEAUTY IN
EVERYTHING ADMIRED BY HIM, AND HER ATTENTION WAS SO EARNEST THAT HE
BECAME PERFECTLY SATISFIED OF HER HAVING A GREAT DEAL OF NATURAL TASTE.
HE TALKED OF FOREGROUNDS, DISTANCES, AND SECOND DISTANCES--SIDE-SCREENS
AND PERSPECTIVES--LIGHTS AND SHADES; AND CATHERINE WAS SO HOPEFUL A
SCHOLAR THAT WHEN THEY GAINED THE TOP OF BEECHEN CLIFF, SHE VOLUNTARILY
REJECTED THE WHOLE CITY OF BATH AS UNWORTHY TO MAKE PART OF A LANDSCAPE.
DELIGHTED WITH HER PROGRESS, AND FEARFUL OF WEARYING HER WITH TOO MUCH
WISDOM AT ONCE, HENRY SUFFERED THE SUBJECT TO DECLINE, AND BY AN EASY
TRANSITION FROM A PIECE OF ROCKY FRAGMENT AND THE WITHERED OAK WHICH
HE HAD PLACED NEAR ITS SUMMIT, TO OAKS IN GENERAL, TO FORESTS, THE
ENCLOSURE OF THEM, WASTE LANDS, CROWN LANDS AND GOVERNMENT, HE SHORTLY
FOUND HIMSELF ARRIVED AT POLITICS; AND FROM POLITICS, IT WAS AN
EASY STEP TO SILENCE. THE GENERAL PAUSE WHICH SUCCEEDED HIS SHORT
DISQUISITION ON THE STATE OF THE NATION WAS PUT AN END TO BY CATHERINE,
WHO, IN RATHER A SOLEMN TONE OF VOICE, UTTERED THESE WORDS, "I HAVE
HEARD THAT SOMETHING VERY SHOCKING INDEED WILL SOON COME OUT IN LONDON."

MISS TILNEY, TO WHOM THIS WAS CHIEFLY ADDRESSED, WAS STARTLED, AND
HASTILY REPLIED, "INDEED! AND OF WHAT NATURE?"

"THAT I DO NOT KNOW, NOR WHO IS THE AUTHOR. I HAVE ONLY HEARD THAT IT IS
TO BE MORE HORRIBLE THAN ANYTHING WE HAVE MET WITH YET."

"GOOD HEAVEN! WHERE COULD YOU HEAR OF SUCH A THING?"

"A PARTICULAR FRIEND OF MINE HAD AN ACCOUNT OF IT IN A LETTER FROM
LONDON YESTERDAY. IT IS TO BE UNCOMMONLY DREADFUL. I SHALL EXPECT MURDER
AND EVERYTHING OF THE KIND."

"YOU SPEAK WITH ASTONISHING COMPOSURE! BUT I HOPE YOUR FRIEND'S ACCOUNTS
HAVE BEEN EXAGGERATED; AND IF SUCH A DESIGN IS KNOWN BEFOREHAND, PROPER
MEASURES WILL UNDOUBTEDLY BE TAKEN BY GOVERNMENT TO PREVENT ITS COMING
TO EFFECT."

"GOVERNMENT," SAID HENRY, ENDEAVOURING NOT TO SMILE, "NEITHER DESIRES
NOR DARES TO INTERFERE IN SUCH MATTERS. THERE MUST BE MURDER; AND
GOVERNMENT CARES NOT HOW MUCH."

THE LADIES STARED. HE LAUGHED, AND ADDED, "COME, SHALL I MAKE YOU
UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER, OR LEAVE YOU TO PUZZLE OUT AN EXPLANATION AS
YOU CAN? NO--I WILL BE NOBLE. I WILL PROVE MYSELF A MAN, NO LESS BY THE
GENEROSITY OF MY SOUL THAN THE CLEARNESS OF MY HEAD. I HAVE NO PATIENCE
WITH SUCH OF MY SEX AS DISDAIN TO LET THEMSELVES SOMETIMES DOWN TO THE
COMPREHENSION OF YOURS. PERHAPS THE ABILITIES OF WOMEN ARE NEITHER SOUND
NOR ACUTE--NEITHER VIGOROUS NOR KEEN. PERHAPS THEY MAY WANT OBSERVATION,
DISCERNMENT, JUDGMENT, FIRE, GENIUS, AND WIT."

"MISS MORLAND, DO NOT MIND WHAT HE SAYS; BUT HAVE THE GOODNESS TO
SATISFY ME AS TO THIS DREADFUL RIOT."

"RIOT! WHAT RIOT?"

"MY DEAR ELEANOR, THE RIOT IS ONLY IN YOUR OWN BRAIN. THE CONFUSION
THERE IS SCANDALOUS. MISS MORLAND HAS BEEN TALKING OF NOTHING MORE
DREADFUL THAN A NEW PUBLICATION WHICH IS SHORTLY TO COME OUT, IN THREE
DUODECIMO VOLUMES, TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY-SIX PAGES IN EACH, WITH
A FRONTISPIECE TO THE FIRST, OF TWO TOMBSTONES AND A LANTERN--DO YOU
UNDERSTAND? AND YOU, MISS MORLAND--MY STUPID SISTER HAS MISTAKEN ALL
YOUR CLEAREST EXPRESSIONS. YOU TALKED OF EXPECTED HORRORS IN LONDON--AND
INSTEAD OF INSTANTLY CONCEIVING, AS ANY RATIONAL CREATURE WOULD HAVE
DONE, THAT SUCH WORDS COULD RELATE ONLY TO A CIRCULATING LIBRARY, SHE
IMMEDIATELY PICTURED TO HERSELF A MOB OF THREE THOUSAND MEN ASSEMBLING
IN ST. GEORGE'S FIELDS, THE BANK ATTACKED, THE TOWER THREATENED, THE
STREETS OF LONDON FLOWING WITH BLOOD, A DETACHMENT OF THE TWELFTH LIGHT
DRAGOONS (THE HOPES OF THE NATION) CALLED UP FROM NORTHAMPTON TO QUELL
THE INSURGENTS, AND THE GALLANT CAPTAIN FREDERICK TILNEY, IN THE
MOMENT OF CHARGING AT THE HEAD OF HIS TROOP, KNOCKED OFF HIS HORSE BY A
BRICKBAT FROM AN UPPER WINDOW. FORGIVE HER STUPIDITY. THE FEARS OF THE
SISTER HAVE ADDED TO THE WEAKNESS OF THE WOMAN; BUT SHE IS BY NO MEANS A
SIMPLETON IN GENERAL."

CATHERINE LOOKED GRAVE. "AND NOW, HENRY," SAID MISS TILNEY, "THAT YOU
HAVE MADE US UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER, YOU MAY AS WELL MAKE MISS MORLAND
UNDERSTAND YOURSELF--UNLESS YOU MEAN TO HAVE HER THINK YOU INTOLERABLY
RUDE TO YOUR SISTER, AND A GREAT BRUTE IN YOUR OPINION OF WOMEN IN
GENERAL. MISS MORLAND IS NOT USED TO YOUR ODD WAYS."

"I SHALL BE MOST HAPPY TO MAKE HER BETTER ACQUAINTED WITH THEM."

"NO DOUBT; BUT THAT IS NO EXPLANATION OF THE PRESENT."

"WHAT AM I TO DO?"

"YOU KNOW WHAT YOU OUGHT TO DO. CLEAR YOUR CHARACTER HANDSOMELY BEFORE
HER. TELL HER THAT YOU THINK VERY HIGHLY OF THE UNDERSTANDING OF WOMEN."

"MISS MORLAND, I THINK VERY HIGHLY OF THE UNDERSTANDING OF ALL THE WOMEN
IN THE WORLD--ESPECIALLY OF THOSE--WHOEVER THEY MAY BE--WITH WHOM I
HAPPEN TO BE IN COMPANY."

"THAT IS NOT ENOUGH. BE MORE SERIOUS."

"MISS MORLAND, NO ONE CAN THINK MORE HIGHLY OF THE UNDERSTANDING OF
WOMEN THAN I DO. IN MY OPINION, NATURE HAS GIVEN THEM SO MUCH THAT THEY
NEVER FIND IT NECESSARY TO USE MORE THAN HALF."

"WE SHALL GET NOTHING MORE SERIOUS FROM HIM NOW, MISS MORLAND. HE IS
NOT IN A SOBER MOOD. BUT I DO ASSURE YOU THAT HE MUST BE ENTIRELY
MISUNDERSTOOD, IF HE CAN EVER APPEAR TO SAY AN UNJUST THING OF ANY WOMAN
AT ALL, OR AN UNKIND ONE OF ME."

IT WAS NO EFFORT TO CATHERINE TO BELIEVE THAT HENRY TILNEY COULD NEVER
BE WRONG. HIS MANNER MIGHT SOMETIMES SURPRISE, BUT HIS MEANING MUST
ALWAYS BE JUST: AND WHAT SHE DID NOT UNDERSTAND, SHE WAS ALMOST AS READY
TO ADMIRE, AS WHAT SHE DID. THE WHOLE WALK WAS DELIGHTFUL, AND THOUGH IT
ENDED TOO SOON, ITS CONCLUSION WAS DELIGHTFUL TOO; HER FRIENDS ATTENDED
HER INTO THE HOUSE, AND MISS TILNEY, BEFORE THEY PARTED, ADDRESSING
HERSELF WITH RESPECTFUL FORM, AS MUCH TO MRS. ALLEN AS TO CATHERINE,
PETITIONED FOR THE PLEASURE OF HER COMPANY TO DINNER ON THE DAY AFTER
THE NEXT. NO DIFFICULTY WAS MADE ON MRS. ALLEN'S SIDE, AND THE ONLY
DIFFICULTY ON CATHERINE'S WAS IN CONCEALING THE EXCESS OF HER PLEASURE.

THE MORNING HAD PASSED AWAY SO CHARMINGLY AS TO BANISH ALL HER
FRIENDSHIP AND NATURAL AFFECTION, FOR NO THOUGHT OF ISABELLA OR JAMES
HAD CROSSED HER DURING THEIR WALK. WHEN THE TILNEYS WERE GONE, SHE
BECAME AMIABLE AGAIN, BUT SHE WAS AMIABLE FOR SOME TIME TO LITTLE
EFFECT; MRS. ALLEN HAD NO INTELLIGENCE TO GIVE THAT COULD RELIEVE HER
ANXIETY; SHE HAD HEARD NOTHING OF ANY OF THEM. TOWARDS THE END OF THE
MORNING, HOWEVER, CATHERINE, HAVING OCCASION FOR SOME INDISPENSABLE YARD
OF RIBBON WHICH MUST BE BOUGHT WITHOUT A MOMENT'S DELAY, WALKED OUT INTO
THE TOWN, AND IN BOND STREET OVERTOOK THE SECOND MISS THORPE AS SHE WAS
LOITERING TOWARDS EDGAR'S BUILDINGS BETWEEN TWO OF THE SWEETEST GIRLS IN
THE WORLD, WHO HAD BEEN HER DEAR FRIENDS ALL THE MORNING. FROM HER, SHE
SOON LEARNED THAT THE PARTY TO CLIFTON HAD TAKEN PLACE. "THEY SET OFF AT
EIGHT THIS MORNING," SAID MISS ANNE, "AND I AM SURE I DO NOT ENVY
THEM THEIR DRIVE. I THINK YOU AND I ARE VERY WELL OFF TO BE OUT OF THE
SCRAPE. IT MUST BE THE DULLEST THING IN THE WORLD, FOR THERE IS NOT A
SOUL AT CLIFTON AT THIS TIME OF YEAR. BELLE WENT WITH YOUR BROTHER, AND
JOHN DROVE MARIA."

CATHERINE SPOKE THE PLEASURE SHE REALLY FELT ON HEARING THIS PART OF THE
ARRANGEMENT.

"OH! YES," REJOINED THE OTHER, "MARIA IS GONE. SHE WAS QUITE WILD TO GO.
SHE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE SOMETHING VERY FINE. I CANNOT SAY I ADMIRE HER
TASTE; AND FOR MY PART, I WAS DETERMINED FROM THE FIRST NOT TO GO, IF
THEY PRESSED ME EVER SO MUCH."

CATHERINE, A LITTLE DOUBTFUL OF THIS, COULD NOT HELP ANSWERING, "I WISH
YOU COULD HAVE GONE TOO. IT IS A PITY YOU COULD NOT ALL GO."

"THANK YOU; BUT IT IS QUITE A MATTER OF INDIFFERENCE TO ME. INDEED, I
WOULD NOT HAVE GONE ON ANY ACCOUNT. I WAS SAYING SO TO EMILY AND SOPHIA
WHEN YOU OVERTOOK US."

CATHERINE WAS STILL UNCONVINCED; BUT GLAD THAT ANNE SHOULD HAVE THE
FRIENDSHIP OF AN EMILY AND A SOPHIA TO CONSOLE HER, SHE BADE HER ADIEU
WITHOUT MUCH UNEASINESS, AND RETURNED HOME, PLEASED THAT THE PARTY HAD
NOT BEEN PREVENTED BY HER REFUSING TO JOIN IT, AND VERY HEARTILY WISHING
THAT IT MIGHT BE TOO PLEASANT TO ALLOW EITHER JAMES OR ISABELLA TO
RESENT HER RESISTANCE ANY LONGER.




CHAPTER 15


EARLY THE NEXT DAY, A NOTE FROM ISABELLA, SPEAKING PEACE AND TENDERNESS
IN EVERY LINE, AND ENTREATING THE IMMEDIATE PRESENCE OF HER FRIEND ON
A MATTER OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE, HASTENED CATHERINE, IN THE HAPPIEST
STATE OF CONFIDENCE AND CURIOSITY, TO EDGAR'S BUILDINGS. THE TWO
YOUNGEST MISS THORPES WERE BY THEMSELVES IN THE PARLOUR; AND, ON ANNE'S
QUITTING IT TO CALL HER SISTER, CATHERINE TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY OF ASKING
THE OTHER FOR SOME PARTICULARS OF THEIR YESTERDAY'S PARTY. MARIA DESIRED
NO GREATER PLEASURE THAN TO SPEAK OF IT; AND CATHERINE IMMEDIATELY
LEARNT THAT IT HAD BEEN ALTOGETHER THE MOST DELIGHTFUL SCHEME IN THE
WORLD, THAT NOBODY COULD IMAGINE HOW CHARMING IT HAD BEEN, AND THAT
IT HAD BEEN MORE DELIGHTFUL THAN ANYBODY COULD CONCEIVE. SUCH WAS THE
INFORMATION OF THE FIRST FIVE MINUTES; THE SECOND UNFOLDED THUS MUCH IN
DETAIL--THAT THEY HAD DRIVEN DIRECTLY TO THE YORK HOTEL, ATE SOME SOUP,
AND BESPOKE AN EARLY DINNER, WALKED DOWN TO THE PUMP-ROOM, TASTED THE
WATER, AND LAID OUT SOME SHILLINGS IN PURSES AND SPARS; THENCE ADJOINED
TO EAT ICE AT A PASTRY-COOK'S, AND HURRYING BACK TO THE HOTEL, SWALLOWED
THEIR DINNER IN HASTE, TO PREVENT BEING IN THE DARK; AND THEN HAD A
DELIGHTFUL DRIVE BACK, ONLY THE MOON WAS NOT UP, AND IT RAINED A LITTLE,
AND MR. MORLAND'S HORSE WAS SO TIRED HE COULD HARDLY GET IT ALONG.

CATHERINE LISTENED WITH HEARTFELT SATISFACTION. IT APPEARED THAT BLAIZE
CASTLE HAD NEVER BEEN THOUGHT OF; AND, AS FOR ALL THE REST, THERE WAS
NOTHING TO REGRET FOR HALF AN INSTANT. MARIA'S INTELLIGENCE CONCLUDED
WITH A TENDER EFFUSION OF PITY FOR HER SISTER ANNE, WHOM SHE REPRESENTED
AS INSUPPORTABLY CROSS, FROM BEING EXCLUDED THE PARTY.

"SHE WILL NEVER FORGIVE ME, I AM SURE; BUT, YOU KNOW, HOW COULD I HELP
IT? JOHN WOULD HAVE ME GO, FOR HE VOWED HE WOULD NOT DRIVE HER, BECAUSE
SHE HAD SUCH THICK ANKLES. I DARE SAY SHE WILL NOT BE IN GOOD HUMOUR
AGAIN THIS MONTH; BUT I AM DETERMINED I WILL NOT BE CROSS; IT IS NOT A
LITTLE MATTER THAT PUTS ME OUT OF TEMPER."

ISABELLA NOW ENTERED THE ROOM WITH SO EAGER A STEP, AND A LOOK OF SUCH
HAPPY IMPORTANCE, AS ENGAGED ALL HER FRIEND'S NOTICE. MARIA WAS WITHOUT
CEREMONY SENT AWAY, AND ISABELLA, EMBRACING CATHERINE, THUS BEGAN: "YES,
MY DEAR CATHERINE, IT IS SO INDEED; YOUR PENETRATION HAS NOT DECEIVED
YOU. OH! THAT ARCH EYE OF YOURS! IT SEES THROUGH EVERYTHING."

CATHERINE REPLIED ONLY BY A LOOK OF WONDERING IGNORANCE.

"NAY, MY BELOVED, SWEETEST FRIEND," CONTINUED THE OTHER, "COMPOSE
YOURSELF. I AM AMAZINGLY AGITATED, AS YOU PERCEIVE. LET US SIT DOWN AND
TALK IN COMFORT. WELL, AND SO YOU GUESSED IT THE MOMENT YOU HAD MY NOTE?
SLY CREATURE! OH! MY DEAR CATHERINE, YOU ALONE, WHO KNOW MY HEART, CAN
JUDGE OF MY PRESENT HAPPINESS. YOUR BROTHER IS THE MOST CHARMING OF
MEN. I ONLY WISH I WERE MORE WORTHY OF HIM. BUT WHAT WILL YOUR EXCELLENT
FATHER AND MOTHER SAY? OH! HEAVENS! WHEN I THINK OF THEM I AM SO
AGITATED!"

CATHERINE'S UNDERSTANDING BEGAN TO AWAKE: AN IDEA OF THE TRUTH SUDDENLY
DARTED INTO HER MIND; AND, WITH THE NATURAL BLUSH OF SO NEW AN EMOTION,
SHE CRIED OUT, "GOOD HEAVEN! MY DEAR ISABELLA, WHAT DO YOU MEAN? CAN
YOU--CAN YOU REALLY BE IN LOVE WITH JAMES?"

THIS BOLD SURMISE, HOWEVER, SHE SOON LEARNT COMPREHENDED BUT HALF THE
FACT. THE ANXIOUS AFFECTION, WHICH SHE WAS ACCUSED OF HAVING CONTINUALLY
WATCHED IN ISABELLA'S EVERY LOOK AND ACTION, HAD, IN THE COURSE OF THEIR
YESTERDAY'S PARTY, RECEIVED THE DELIGHTFUL CONFESSION OF AN EQUAL LOVE.
HER HEART AND FAITH WERE ALIKE ENGAGED TO JAMES. NEVER HAD CATHERINE
LISTENED TO ANYTHING SO FULL OF INTEREST, WONDER, AND JOY. HER BROTHER
AND HER FRIEND ENGAGED! NEW TO SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES, THE IMPORTANCE OF
IT APPEARED UNSPEAKABLY GREAT, AND SHE CONTEMPLATED IT AS ONE OF THOSE
GRAND EVENTS, OF WHICH THE ORDINARY COURSE OF LIFE CAN HARDLY AFFORD A
RETURN. THE STRENGTH OF HER FEELINGS SHE COULD NOT EXPRESS; THE NATURE
OF THEM, HOWEVER, CONTENTED HER FRIEND. THE HAPPINESS OF HAVING SUCH A
SISTER WAS THEIR FIRST EFFUSION, AND THE FAIR LADIES MINGLED IN EMBRACES
AND TEARS OF JOY.

DELIGHTING, HOWEVER, AS CATHERINE SINCERELY DID IN THE PROSPECT OF THE
CONNECTION, IT MUST BE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT ISABELLA FAR SURPASSED HER
IN TENDER ANTICIPATIONS. "YOU WILL BE SO INFINITELY DEARER TO ME, MY
CATHERINE, THAN EITHER ANNE OR MARIA: I FEEL THAT I SHALL BE SO MUCH
MORE ATTACHED TO MY DEAR MORLAND'S FAMILY THAN TO MY OWN."

THIS WAS A PITCH OF FRIENDSHIP BEYOND CATHERINE.

"YOU ARE SO LIKE YOUR DEAR BROTHER," CONTINUED ISABELLA, "THAT I QUITE
DOTED ON YOU THE FIRST MOMENT I SAW YOU. BUT SO IT ALWAYS IS WITH ME;
THE FIRST MOMENT SETTLES EVERYTHING. THE VERY FIRST DAY THAT MORLAND
CAME TO US LAST CHRISTMAS--THE VERY FIRST MOMENT I BEHELD HIM--MY HEART
WAS IRRECOVERABLY GONE. I REMEMBER I WORE MY YELLOW GOWN, WITH MY HAIR
DONE UP IN BRAIDS; AND WHEN I CAME INTO THE DRAWING-ROOM, AND JOHN
INTRODUCED HIM, I THOUGHT I NEVER SAW ANYBODY SO HANDSOME BEFORE."

HERE CATHERINE SECRETLY ACKNOWLEDGED THE POWER OF LOVE; FOR, THOUGH
EXCEEDINGLY FOND OF HER BROTHER, AND PARTIAL TO ALL HIS ENDOWMENTS, SHE
HAD NEVER IN HER LIFE THOUGHT HIM HANDSOME.

"I REMEMBER TOO, MISS ANDREWS DRANK TEA WITH US THAT EVENING, AND WORE
HER PUCE-COLOURED SARSENET; AND SHE LOOKED SO HEAVENLY THAT I THOUGHT
YOUR BROTHER MUST CERTAINLY FALL IN LOVE WITH HER; I COULD NOT SLEEP
A WINK ALL RIGHT FOR THINKING OF IT. OH! CATHERINE, THE MANY SLEEPLESS
NIGHTS I HAVE HAD ON YOUR BROTHER'S ACCOUNT! I WOULD NOT HAVE YOU SUFFER
HALF WHAT I HAVE DONE! I AM GROWN WRETCHEDLY THIN, I KNOW; BUT I WILL
NOT PAIN YOU BY DESCRIBING MY ANXIETY; YOU HAVE SEEN ENOUGH OF IT. I
FEEL THAT I HAVE BETRAYED MYSELF PERPETUALLY--SO UNGUARDED IN SPEAKING
OF MY PARTIALITY FOR THE CHURCH! BUT MY SECRET I WAS ALWAYS SURE WOULD
BE SAFE WITH YOU."

CATHERINE FELT THAT NOTHING COULD HAVE BEEN SAFER; BUT ASHAMED OF AN
IGNORANCE LITTLE EXPECTED, SHE DARED NO LONGER CONTEST THE POINT,
NOR REFUSE TO HAVE BEEN AS FULL OF ARCH PENETRATION AND AFFECTIONATE
SYMPATHY AS ISABELLA CHOSE TO CONSIDER HER. HER BROTHER, SHE FOUND,
WAS PREPARING TO SET OFF WITH ALL SPEED TO FULLERTON, TO MAKE KNOWN HIS
SITUATION AND ASK CONSENT; AND HERE WAS A SOURCE OF SOME REAL AGITATION
TO THE MIND OF ISABELLA. CATHERINE ENDEAVOURED TO PERSUADE HER, AS SHE
WAS HERSELF PERSUADED, THAT HER FATHER AND MOTHER WOULD NEVER OPPOSE
THEIR SON'S WISHES. "IT IS IMPOSSIBLE," SAID SHE, "FOR PARENTS TO BE
MORE KIND, OR MORE DESIROUS OF THEIR CHILDREN'S HAPPINESS; I HAVE NO
DOUBT OF THEIR CONSENTING IMMEDIATELY."

"MORLAND SAYS EXACTLY THE SAME," REPLIED ISABELLA; "AND YET I DARE NOT
EXPECT IT; MY FORTUNE WILL BE SO SMALL; THEY NEVER CAN CONSENT TO IT.
YOUR BROTHER, WHO MIGHT MARRY ANYBODY!"

HERE CATHERINE AGAIN DISCERNED THE FORCE OF LOVE.

"INDEED, ISABELLA, YOU ARE TOO HUMBLE. THE DIFFERENCE OF FORTUNE CAN BE
NOTHING TO SIGNIFY."

"OH! MY SWEET CATHERINE, IN YOUR GENEROUS HEART I KNOW IT WOULD SIGNIFY
NOTHING; BUT WE MUST NOT EXPECT SUCH DISINTERESTEDNESS IN MANY. AS FOR
MYSELF, I AM SURE I ONLY WISH OUR SITUATIONS WERE REVERSED. HAD I THE
COMMAND OF MILLIONS, WERE I MISTRESS OF THE WHOLE WORLD, YOUR BROTHER
WOULD BE MY ONLY CHOICE."

THIS CHARMING SENTIMENT, RECOMMENDED AS MUCH BY SENSE AS NOVELTY,
GAVE CATHERINE A MOST PLEASING REMEMBRANCE OF ALL THE HEROINES OF HER
ACQUAINTANCE; AND SHE THOUGHT HER FRIEND NEVER LOOKED MORE LOVELY THAN
IN UTTERING THE GRAND IDEA. "I AM SURE THEY WILL CONSENT," WAS HER
FREQUENT DECLARATION; "I AM SURE THEY WILL BE DELIGHTED WITH YOU."

"FOR MY OWN PART," SAID ISABELLA, "MY WISHES ARE SO MODERATE THAT THE
SMALLEST INCOME IN NATURE WOULD BE ENOUGH FOR ME. WHERE PEOPLE ARE
REALLY ATTACHED, POVERTY ITSELF IS WEALTH; GRANDEUR I DETEST: I WOULD
NOT SETTLE IN LONDON FOR THE UNIVERSE. A COTTAGE IN SOME RETIRED VILLAGE
WOULD BE ECSTASY. THERE ARE SOME CHARMING LITTLE VILLAS ABOUT RICHMOND."

"RICHMOND!" CRIED CATHERINE. "YOU MUST SETTLE NEAR FULLERTON. YOU MUST
BE NEAR US."

"I AM SURE I SHALL BE MISERABLE IF WE DO NOT. IF I CAN BUT BE NEAR YOU,
I SHALL BE SATISFIED. BUT THIS IS IDLE TALKING! I WILL NOT ALLOW MYSELF
TO THINK OF SUCH THINGS, TILL WE HAVE YOUR FATHER'S ANSWER. MORLAND
SAYS THAT BY SENDING IT TONIGHT TO SALISBURY, WE MAY HAVE IT TOMORROW.
TOMORROW? I KNOW I SHALL NEVER HAVE COURAGE TO OPEN THE LETTER. I KNOW
IT WILL BE THE DEATH OF ME."

A REVERIE SUCCEEDED THIS CONVICTION--AND WHEN ISABELLA SPOKE AGAIN, IT
WAS TO RESOLVE ON THE QUALITY OF HER WEDDING-GOWN.

THEIR CONFERENCE WAS PUT AN END TO BY THE ANXIOUS YOUNG LOVER HIMSELF,
WHO CAME TO BREATHE HIS PARTING SIGH BEFORE HE SET OFF FOR WILTSHIRE.
CATHERINE WISHED TO CONGRATULATE HIM, BUT KNEW NOT WHAT TO SAY, AND HER
ELOQUENCE WAS ONLY IN HER EYES. FROM THEM, HOWEVER, THE EIGHT PARTS OF
SPEECH SHONE OUT MOST EXPRESSIVELY, AND JAMES COULD COMBINE THEM WITH
EASE. IMPATIENT FOR THE REALIZATION OF ALL THAT HE HOPED AT HOME, HIS
ADIEUS WERE NOT LONG; AND THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN YET SHORTER, HAD HE NOT
BEEN FREQUENTLY DETAINED BY THE URGENT ENTREATIES OF HIS FAIR ONE THAT
HE WOULD GO. TWICE WAS HE CALLED ALMOST FROM THE DOOR BY HER EAGERNESS
TO HAVE HIM GONE. "INDEED, MORLAND, I MUST DRIVE YOU AWAY. CONSIDER HOW
FAR YOU HAVE TO RIDE. I CANNOT BEAR TO SEE YOU LINGER SO. FOR HEAVEN'S
SAKE, WASTE NO MORE TIME. THERE, GO, GO--I INSIST ON IT."

THE TWO FRIENDS, WITH HEARTS NOW MORE UNITED THAN EVER, WERE INSEPARABLE
FOR THE DAY; AND IN SCHEMES OF SISTERLY HAPPINESS THE HOURS FLEW ALONG.
MRS. THORPE AND HER SON, WHO WERE ACQUAINTED WITH EVERYTHING, AND
WHO SEEMED ONLY TO WANT MR. MORLAND'S CONSENT, TO CONSIDER ISABELLA'S
ENGAGEMENT AS THE MOST FORTUNATE CIRCUMSTANCE IMAGINABLE FOR THEIR
FAMILY, WERE ALLOWED TO JOIN THEIR COUNSELS, AND ADD THEIR QUOTA OF
SIGNIFICANT LOOKS AND MYSTERIOUS EXPRESSIONS TO FILL UP THE MEASURE
OF CURIOSITY TO BE RAISED IN THE UNPRIVILEGED YOUNGER SISTERS. TO
CATHERINE'S SIMPLE FEELINGS, THIS ODD SORT OF RESERVE SEEMED NEITHER
KINDLY MEANT, NOR CONSISTENTLY SUPPORTED; AND ITS UNKINDNESS SHE WOULD
HARDLY HAVE FORBORNE POINTING OUT, HAD ITS INCONSISTENCY BEEN LESS THEIR
FRIEND; BUT ANNE AND MARIA SOON SET HER HEART AT EASE BY THE SAGACITY OF
THEIR "I KNOW WHAT"; AND THE EVENING WAS SPENT IN A SORT OF WAR OF WIT,
A DISPLAY OF FAMILY INGENUITY, ON ONE SIDE IN THE MYSTERY OF AN AFFECTED
SECRET, ON THE OTHER OF UNDEFINED DISCOVERY, ALL EQUALLY ACUTE.

CATHERINE WAS WITH HER FRIEND AGAIN THE NEXT DAY, ENDEAVOURING TO
SUPPORT HER SPIRITS AND WHILE AWAY THE MANY TEDIOUS HOURS BEFORE
THE DELIVERY OF THE LETTERS; A NEEDFUL EXERTION, FOR AS THE TIME
OF REASONABLE EXPECTATION DREW NEAR, ISABELLA BECAME MORE AND MORE
DESPONDING, AND BEFORE THE LETTER ARRIVED, HAD WORKED HERSELF INTO A
STATE OF REAL DISTRESS. BUT WHEN IT DID COME, WHERE COULD DISTRESS
BE FOUND? "I HAVE HAD NO DIFFICULTY IN GAINING THE CONSENT OF MY KIND
PARENTS, AND AM PROMISED THAT EVERYTHING IN THEIR POWER SHALL BE DONE TO
FORWARD MY HAPPINESS," WERE THE FIRST THREE LINES, AND IN ONE MOMENT
ALL WAS JOYFUL SECURITY. THE BRIGHTEST GLOW WAS INSTANTLY SPREAD OVER
ISABELLA'S FEATURES, ALL CARE AND ANXIETY SEEMED REMOVED, HER SPIRITS
BECAME ALMOST TOO HIGH FOR CONTROL, AND SHE CALLED HERSELF WITHOUT
SCRUPLE THE HAPPIEST OF MORTALS.

MRS. THORPE, WITH TEARS OF JOY, EMBRACED HER DAUGHTER, HER SON, HER
VISITOR, AND COULD HAVE EMBRACED HALF THE INHABITANTS OF BATH WITH
SATISFACTION. HER HEART WAS OVERFLOWING WITH TENDERNESS. IT WAS "DEAR
JOHN" AND "DEAR CATHERINE" AT EVERY WORD; "DEAR ANNE AND DEAR MARIA"
MUST IMMEDIATELY BE MADE SHARERS IN THEIR FELICITY; AND TWO "DEARS" AT
ONCE BEFORE THE NAME OF ISABELLA WERE NOT MORE THAN THAT BELOVED CHILD
HAD NOW WELL EARNED. JOHN HIMSELF WAS NO SKULKER IN JOY. HE NOT ONLY
BESTOWED ON MR. MORLAND THE HIGH COMMENDATION OF BEING ONE OF THE FINEST
FELLOWS IN THE WORLD, BUT SWORE OFF MANY SENTENCES IN HIS PRAISE.

THE LETTER, WHENCE SPRANG ALL THIS FELICITY, WAS SHORT, CONTAINING
LITTLE MORE THAN THIS ASSURANCE OF SUCCESS; AND EVERY PARTICULAR WAS
DEFERRED TILL JAMES COULD WRITE AGAIN. BUT FOR PARTICULARS ISABELLA
COULD WELL AFFORD TO WAIT. THE NEEDFUL WAS COMPRISED IN MR. MORLAND'S
PROMISE; HIS HONOUR WAS PLEDGED TO MAKE EVERYTHING EASY; AND BY WHAT
MEANS THEIR INCOME WAS TO BE FORMED, WHETHER LANDED PROPERTY WERE TO
BE RESIGNED, OR FUNDED MONEY MADE OVER, WAS A MATTER IN WHICH HER
DISINTERESTED SPIRIT TOOK NO CONCERN. SHE KNEW ENOUGH TO FEEL SECURE OF
AN HONOURABLE AND SPEEDY ESTABLISHMENT, AND HER IMAGINATION TOOK A RAPID
FLIGHT OVER ITS ATTENDANT FELICITIES. SHE SAW HERSELF AT THE END OF
A FEW WEEKS, THE GAZE AND ADMIRATION OF EVERY NEW ACQUAINTANCE AT
FULLERTON, THE ENVY OF EVERY VALUED OLD FRIEND IN PUTNEY, WITH A
CARRIAGE AT HER COMMAND, A NEW NAME ON HER TICKETS, AND A BRILLIANT
EXHIBITION OF HOOP RINGS ON HER FINGER.

WHEN THE CONTENTS OF THE LETTER WERE ASCERTAINED, JOHN THORPE, WHO HAD
ONLY WAITED ITS ARRIVAL TO BEGIN HIS JOURNEY TO LONDON, PREPARED TO SET
OFF. "WELL, MISS MORLAND," SAID HE, ON FINDING HER ALONE IN THE PARLOUR,
"I AM COME TO BID YOU GOOD-BYE." CATHERINE WISHED HIM A GOOD JOURNEY.
WITHOUT APPEARING TO HEAR HER, HE WALKED TO THE WINDOW, FIDGETED ABOUT,
HUMMED A TUNE, AND SEEMED WHOLLY SELF-OCCUPIED.

"SHALL NOT YOU BE LATE AT DEVIZES?" SAID CATHERINE. HE MADE NO ANSWER;
BUT AFTER A MINUTE'S SILENCE BURST OUT WITH, "A FAMOUS GOOD THING THIS
MARRYING SCHEME, UPON MY SOUL! A CLEVER FANCY OF MORLAND'S AND BELLE'S.
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF IT, MISS MORLAND? I SAY IT IS NO BAD NOTION."

"I AM SURE I THINK IT A VERY GOOD ONE."

"DO YOU? THAT'S HONEST, BY HEAVENS! I AM GLAD YOU ARE NO ENEMY TO
MATRIMONY, HOWEVER. DID YOU EVER HEAR THE OLD SONG 'GOING TO ONE WEDDING
BRINGS ON ANOTHER?' I SAY, YOU WILL COME TO BELLE'S WEDDING, I HOPE."

"YES; I HAVE PROMISED YOUR SISTER TO BE WITH HER, IF POSSIBLE."

"AND THEN YOU KNOW"--TWISTING HIMSELF ABOUT AND FORCING A FOOLISH
LAUGH--"I SAY, THEN YOU KNOW, WE MAY TRY THE TRUTH OF THIS SAME OLD
SONG."

"MAY WE? BUT I NEVER SING. WELL, I WISH YOU A GOOD JOURNEY. I DINE WITH
MISS TILNEY TODAY, AND MUST NOW BE GOING HOME."

"NAY, BUT THERE IS NO SUCH CONFOUNDED HURRY. WHO KNOWS WHEN WE MAY
BE TOGETHER AGAIN? NOT BUT THAT I SHALL BE DOWN AGAIN BY THE END OF A
FORTNIGHT, AND A DEVILISH LONG FORTNIGHT IT WILL APPEAR TO ME."

"THEN WHY DO YOU STAY AWAY SO LONG?" REPLIED CATHERINE--FINDING THAT HE
WAITED FOR AN ANSWER.

"THAT IS KIND OF YOU, HOWEVER--KIND AND GOOD-NATURED. I SHALL NOT FORGET
IT IN A HURRY. BUT YOU HAVE MORE GOOD NATURE AND ALL THAT, THAN ANYBODY
LIVING, I BELIEVE. A MONSTROUS DEAL OF GOOD NATURE, AND IT IS NOT ONLY
GOOD NATURE, BUT YOU HAVE SO MUCH, SO MUCH OF EVERYTHING; AND THEN YOU
HAVE SUCH--UPON MY SOUL, I DO NOT KNOW ANYBODY LIKE YOU."

"OH! DEAR, THERE ARE A GREAT MANY PEOPLE LIKE ME, I DARE SAY, ONLY A
GREAT DEAL BETTER. GOOD MORNING TO YOU."

"BUT I SAY, MISS MORLAND, I SHALL COME AND PAY MY RESPECTS AT FULLERTON
BEFORE IT IS LONG, IF NOT DISAGREEABLE."

"PRAY DO. MY FATHER AND MOTHER WILL BE VERY GLAD TO SEE YOU."

"AND I HOPE--I HOPE, MISS MORLAND, YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY TO SEE ME."

"OH! DEAR, NOT AT ALL. THERE ARE VERY FEW PEOPLE I AM SORRY TO SEE.
COMPANY IS ALWAYS CHEERFUL."

"THAT IS JUST MY WAY OF THINKING. GIVE ME BUT A LITTLE CHEERFUL COMPANY,
LET ME ONLY HAVE THE COMPANY OF THE PEOPLE I LOVE, LET ME ONLY BE WHERE
I LIKE AND WITH WHOM I LIKE, AND THE DEVIL TAKE THE REST, SAY I. AND
I AM HEARTILY GLAD TO HEAR YOU SAY THE SAME. BUT I HAVE A NOTION, MISS
MORLAND, YOU AND I THINK PRETTY MUCH ALIKE UPON MOST MATTERS."

"PERHAPS WE MAY; BUT IT IS MORE THAN I EVER THOUGHT OF. AND AS TO MOST
MATTERS, TO SAY THE TRUTH, THERE ARE NOT MANY THAT I KNOW MY OWN MIND
ABOUT."

"BY JOVE, NO MORE DO I. IT IS NOT MY WAY TO BOTHER MY BRAINS WITH WHAT
DOES NOT CONCERN ME. MY NOTION OF THINGS IS SIMPLE ENOUGH. LET ME ONLY
HAVE THE GIRL I LIKE, SAY I, WITH A COMFORTABLE HOUSE OVER MY HEAD, AND
WHAT CARE I FOR ALL THE REST? FORTUNE IS NOTHING. I AM SURE OF A GOOD
INCOME OF MY OWN; AND IF SHE HAD NOT A PENNY, WHY, SO MUCH THE BETTER."

"VERY TRUE. I THINK LIKE YOU THERE. IF THERE IS A GOOD FORTUNE ON ONE
SIDE, THERE CAN BE NO OCCASION FOR ANY ON THE OTHER. NO MATTER WHICH
HAS IT, SO THAT THERE IS ENOUGH. I HATE THE IDEA OF ONE GREAT FORTUNE
LOOKING OUT FOR ANOTHER. AND TO MARRY FOR MONEY I THINK THE WICKEDEST
THING IN EXISTENCE. GOOD DAY. WE SHALL BE VERY GLAD TO SEE YOU AT
FULLERTON, WHENEVER IT IS CONVENIENT." AND AWAY SHE WENT. IT WAS NOT IN
THE POWER OF ALL HIS GALLANTRY TO DETAIN HER LONGER. WITH SUCH NEWS TO
COMMUNICATE, AND SUCH A VISIT TO PREPARE FOR, HER DEPARTURE WAS NOT
TO BE DELAYED BY ANYTHING IN HIS NATURE TO URGE; AND SHE HURRIED AWAY,
LEAVING HIM TO THE UNDIVIDED CONSCIOUSNESS OF HIS OWN HAPPY ADDRESS, AND
HER EXPLICIT ENCOURAGEMENT.

THE AGITATION WHICH SHE HAD HERSELF EXPERIENCED ON FIRST LEARNING HER
BROTHER'S ENGAGEMENT MADE HER EXPECT TO RAISE NO INCONSIDERABLE EMOTION
IN MR. AND MRS. ALLEN, BY THE COMMUNICATION OF THE WONDERFUL EVENT. HOW
GREAT WAS HER DISAPPOINTMENT! THE IMPORTANT AFFAIR, WHICH MANY WORDS OF
PREPARATION USHERED IN, HAD BEEN FORESEEN BY THEM BOTH EVER SINCE
HER BROTHER'S ARRIVAL; AND ALL THAT THEY FELT ON THE OCCASION WAS
COMPREHENDED IN A WISH FOR THE YOUNG PEOPLE'S HAPPINESS, WITH A REMARK,
ON THE GENTLEMAN'S SIDE, IN FAVOUR OF ISABELLA'S BEAUTY, AND ON THE
LADY'S, OF HER GREAT GOOD LUCK. IT WAS TO CATHERINE THE MOST SURPRISING
INSENSIBILITY. THE DISCLOSURE, HOWEVER, OF THE GREAT SECRET OF JAMES'S
GOING TO FULLERTON THE DAY BEFORE, DID RAISE SOME EMOTION IN MRS. ALLEN.
SHE COULD NOT LISTEN TO THAT WITH PERFECT CALMNESS, BUT REPEATEDLY
REGRETTED THE NECESSITY OF ITS CONCEALMENT, WISHED SHE COULD HAVE KNOWN
HIS INTENTION, WISHED SHE COULD HAVE SEEN HIM BEFORE HE WENT, AS SHE
SHOULD CERTAINLY HAVE TROUBLED HIM WITH HER BEST REGARDS TO HIS FATHER
AND MOTHER, AND HER KIND COMPLIMENTS TO ALL THE SKINNERS.




CHAPTER 16


CATHERINE'S EXPECTATIONS OF PLEASURE FROM HER VISIT IN MILSOM STREET
WERE SO VERY HIGH THAT DISAPPOINTMENT WAS INEVITABLE; AND ACCORDINGLY,
THOUGH SHE WAS MOST POLITELY RECEIVED BY GENERAL TILNEY, AND KINDLY
WELCOMED BY HIS DAUGHTER, THOUGH HENRY WAS AT HOME, AND NO ONE ELSE OF
THE PARTY, SHE FOUND, ON HER RETURN, WITHOUT SPENDING MANY HOURS IN
THE EXAMINATION OF HER FEELINGS, THAT SHE HAD GONE TO HER APPOINTMENT
PREPARING FOR HAPPINESS WHICH IT HAD NOT AFFORDED. INSTEAD OF FINDING
HERSELF IMPROVED IN ACQUAINTANCE WITH MISS TILNEY, FROM THE INTERCOURSE
OF THE DAY, SHE SEEMED HARDLY SO INTIMATE WITH HER AS BEFORE; INSTEAD
OF SEEING HENRY TILNEY TO GREATER ADVANTAGE THAN EVER, IN THE EASE OF A
FAMILY PARTY, HE HAD NEVER SAID SO LITTLE, NOR BEEN SO LITTLE AGREEABLE;
AND, IN SPITE OF THEIR FATHER'S GREAT CIVILITIES TO HER--IN SPITE OF HIS
THANKS, INVITATIONS, AND COMPLIMENTS--IT HAD BEEN A RELEASE TO GET
AWAY FROM HIM. IT PUZZLED HER TO ACCOUNT FOR ALL THIS. IT COULD NOT
BE GENERAL TILNEY'S FAULT. THAT HE WAS PERFECTLY AGREEABLE AND
GOOD-NATURED, AND ALTOGETHER A VERY CHARMING MAN, DID NOT ADMIT OF A
DOUBT, FOR HE WAS TALL AND HANDSOME, AND HENRY'S FATHER. HE COULD NOT
BE ACCOUNTABLE FOR HIS CHILDREN'S WANT OF SPIRITS, OR FOR HER WANT OF
ENJOYMENT IN HIS COMPANY. THE FORMER SHE HOPED AT LAST MIGHT HAVE
BEEN ACCIDENTAL, AND THE LATTER SHE COULD ONLY ATTRIBUTE TO HER OWN
STUPIDITY. ISABELLA, ON HEARING THE PARTICULARS OF THE VISIT, GAVE
A DIFFERENT EXPLANATION: "IT WAS ALL PRIDE, PRIDE, INSUFFERABLE
HAUGHTINESS AND PRIDE! SHE HAD LONG SUSPECTED THE FAMILY TO BE VERY
HIGH, AND THIS MADE IT CERTAIN. SUCH INSOLENCE OF BEHAVIOUR AS MISS
TILNEY'S SHE HAD NEVER HEARD OF IN HER LIFE! NOT TO DO THE HONOURS OF
HER HOUSE WITH COMMON GOOD BREEDING! TO BEHAVE TO HER GUEST WITH SUCH
SUPERCILIOUSNESS! HARDLY EVEN TO SPEAK TO HER!"

"BUT IT WAS NOT SO BAD AS THAT, ISABELLA; THERE WAS NO SUPERCILIOUSNESS;
SHE WAS VERY CIVIL."

"OH! DON'T DEFEND HER! AND THEN THE BROTHER, HE, WHO HAD APPEARED
SO ATTACHED TO YOU! GOOD HEAVENS! WELL, SOME PEOPLE'S FEELINGS ARE
INCOMPREHENSIBLE. AND SO HE HARDLY LOOKED ONCE AT YOU THE WHOLE DAY?"

"I DO NOT SAY SO; BUT HE DID NOT SEEM IN GOOD SPIRITS."

"HOW CONTEMPTIBLE! OF ALL THINGS IN THE WORLD INCONSTANCY IS MY
AVERSION. LET ME ENTREAT YOU NEVER TO THINK OF HIM AGAIN, MY DEAR
CATHERINE; INDEED HE IS UNWORTHY OF YOU."

"UNWORTHY! I DO NOT SUPPOSE HE EVER THINKS OF ME."

"THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT I SAY; HE NEVER THINKS OF YOU. SUCH FICKLENESS!
OH! HOW DIFFERENT TO YOUR BROTHER AND TO MINE! I REALLY BELIEVE JOHN HAS
THE MOST CONSTANT HEART."

"BUT AS FOR GENERAL TILNEY, I ASSURE YOU IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR
ANYBODY TO BEHAVE TO ME WITH GREATER CIVILITY AND ATTENTION; IT SEEMED
TO BE HIS ONLY CARE TO ENTERTAIN AND MAKE ME HAPPY."

"OH! I KNOW NO HARM OF HIM; I DO NOT SUSPECT HIM OF PRIDE. I BELIEVE HE
IS A VERY GENTLEMAN-LIKE MAN. JOHN THINKS VERY WELL OF HIM, AND JOHN'S
JUDGMENT--"

"WELL, I SHALL SEE HOW THEY BEHAVE TO ME THIS EVENING; WE SHALL MEET
THEM AT THE ROOMS."

"AND MUST I GO?"

"DO NOT YOU INTEND IT? I THOUGHT IT WAS ALL SETTLED."

"NAY, SINCE YOU MAKE SUCH A POINT OF IT, I CAN REFUSE YOU NOTHING. BUT
DO NOT INSIST UPON MY BEING VERY AGREEABLE, FOR MY HEART, YOU KNOW, WILL
BE SOME FORTY MILES OFF. AND AS FOR DANCING, DO NOT MENTION IT, I BEG;
THAT IS QUITE OUT OF THE QUESTION. CHARLES HODGES WILL PLAGUE ME TO
DEATH, I DARE SAY; BUT I SHALL CUT HIM VERY SHORT. TEN TO ONE BUT HE
GUESSES THE REASON, AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT I WANT TO AVOID, SO I SHALL
INSIST ON HIS KEEPING HIS CONJECTURE TO HIMSELF."

ISABELLA'S OPINION OF THE TILNEYS DID NOT INFLUENCE HER FRIEND; SHE WAS
SURE THERE HAD BEEN NO INSOLENCE IN THE MANNERS EITHER OF BROTHER OR
SISTER; AND SHE DID NOT CREDIT THERE BEING ANY PRIDE IN THEIR HEARTS.
THE EVENING REWARDED HER CONFIDENCE; SHE WAS MET BY ONE WITH THE SAME
KINDNESS, AND BY THE OTHER WITH THE SAME ATTENTION, AS HERETOFORE: MISS
TILNEY TOOK PAINS TO BE NEAR HER, AND HENRY ASKED HER TO DANCE.

HAVING HEARD THE DAY BEFORE IN MILSOM STREET THAT THEIR ELDER BROTHER,
CAPTAIN TILNEY, WAS EXPECTED ALMOST EVERY HOUR, SHE WAS AT NO LOSS FOR
THE NAME OF A VERY FASHIONABLE-LOOKING, HANDSOME YOUNG MAN, WHOM SHE HAD
NEVER SEEN BEFORE, AND WHO NOW EVIDENTLY BELONGED TO THEIR PARTY. SHE
LOOKED AT HIM WITH GREAT ADMIRATION, AND EVEN SUPPOSED IT POSSIBLE THAT
SOME PEOPLE MIGHT THINK HIM HANDSOMER THAN HIS BROTHER, THOUGH, IN HER
EYES, HIS AIR WAS MORE ASSUMING, AND HIS COUNTENANCE LESS PREPOSSESSING.
HIS TASTE AND MANNERS WERE BEYOND A DOUBT DECIDEDLY INFERIOR; FOR,
WITHIN HER HEARING, HE NOT ONLY PROTESTED AGAINST EVERY THOUGHT OF
DANCING HIMSELF, BUT EVEN LAUGHED OPENLY AT HENRY FOR FINDING IT
POSSIBLE. FROM THE LATTER CIRCUMSTANCE IT MAY BE PRESUMED THAT, WHATEVER
MIGHT BE OUR HEROINE'S OPINION OF HIM, HIS ADMIRATION OF HER WAS NOT
OF A VERY DANGEROUS KIND; NOT LIKELY TO PRODUCE ANIMOSITIES BETWEEN THE
BROTHERS, NOR PERSECUTIONS TO THE LADY. HE CANNOT BE THE INSTIGATOR OF
THE THREE VILLAINS IN HORSEMEN'S GREATCOATS, BY WHOM SHE WILL HEREAFTER
BE FORCED INTO A TRAVELING-CHAISE AND FOUR, WHICH WILL DRIVE OFF WITH
INCREDIBLE SPEED. CATHERINE, MEANWHILE, UNDISTURBED BY PRESENTIMENTS OF
SUCH AN EVIL, OR OF ANY EVIL AT ALL, EXCEPT THAT OF HAVING BUT A SHORT
SET TO DANCE DOWN, ENJOYED HER USUAL HAPPINESS WITH HENRY TILNEY,
LISTENING WITH SPARKLING EYES TO EVERYTHING HE SAID; AND, IN FINDING HIM
IRRESISTIBLE, BECOMING SO HERSELF.

AT THE END OF THE FIRST DANCE, CAPTAIN TILNEY CAME TOWARDS THEM AGAIN,
AND, MUCH TO CATHERINE'S DISSATISFACTION, PULLED HIS BROTHER AWAY. THEY
RETIRED WHISPERING TOGETHER; AND, THOUGH HER DELICATE SENSIBILITY DID
NOT TAKE IMMEDIATE ALARM, AND LAY IT DOWN AS FACT, THAT CAPTAIN TILNEY
MUST HAVE HEARD SOME MALEVOLENT MISREPRESENTATION OF HER, WHICH HE NOW
HASTENED TO COMMUNICATE TO HIS BROTHER, IN THE HOPE OF SEPARATING THEM
FOREVER, SHE COULD NOT HAVE HER PARTNER CONVEYED FROM HER SIGHT WITHOUT
VERY UNEASY SENSATIONS. HER SUSPENSE WAS OF FULL FIVE MINUTES' DURATION;
AND SHE WAS BEGINNING TO THINK IT A VERY LONG QUARTER OF AN HOUR, WHEN
THEY BOTH RETURNED, AND AN EXPLANATION WAS GIVEN, BY HENRY'S REQUESTING
TO KNOW IF SHE THOUGHT HER FRIEND, MISS THORPE, WOULD HAVE ANY OBJECTION
TO DANCING, AS HIS BROTHER WOULD BE MOST HAPPY TO BE INTRODUCED TO
HER. CATHERINE, WITHOUT HESITATION, REPLIED THAT SHE WAS VERY SURE MISS
THORPE DID NOT MEAN TO DANCE AT ALL. THE CRUEL REPLY WAS PASSED ON TO
THE OTHER, AND HE IMMEDIATELY WALKED AWAY.

"YOUR BROTHER WILL NOT MIND IT, I KNOW," SAID SHE, "BECAUSE I HEARD HIM
SAY BEFORE THAT HE HATED DANCING; BUT IT WAS VERY GOOD-NATURED IN HIM
TO THINK OF IT. I SUPPOSE HE SAW ISABELLA SITTING DOWN, AND FANCIED SHE
MIGHT WISH FOR A PARTNER; BUT HE IS QUITE MISTAKEN, FOR SHE WOULD NOT
DANCE UPON ANY ACCOUNT IN THE WORLD."

HENRY SMILED, AND SAID, "HOW VERY LITTLE TROUBLE IT CAN GIVE YOU TO
UNDERSTAND THE MOTIVE OF OTHER PEOPLE'S ACTIONS."

"WHY? WHAT DO YOU MEAN?"

"WITH YOU, IT IS NOT, HOW IS SUCH A ONE LIKELY TO BE INFLUENCED, WHAT
IS THE INDUCEMENT MOST LIKELY TO ACT UPON SUCH A PERSON'S FEELINGS, AGE,
SITUATION, AND PROBABLE HABITS OF LIFE CONSIDERED--BUT, HOW SHOULD I BE
INFLUENCED, WHAT WOULD BE MY INDUCEMENT IN ACTING SO AND SO?"

"I DO NOT UNDERSTAND YOU."

"THEN WE ARE ON VERY UNEQUAL TERMS, FOR I UNDERSTAND YOU PERFECTLY
WELL."

"ME? YES; I CANNOT SPEAK WELL ENOUGH TO BE UNINTELLIGIBLE."

"BRAVO! AN EXCELLENT SATIRE ON MODERN LANGUAGE."

"BUT PRAY TELL ME WHAT YOU MEAN."

"SHALL I INDEED? DO YOU REALLY DESIRE IT? BUT YOU ARE NOT AWARE OF THE
CONSEQUENCES; IT WILL INVOLVE YOU IN A VERY CRUEL EMBARRASSMENT, AND
CERTAINLY BRING ON A DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN US.

"NO, NO; IT SHALL NOT DO EITHER; I AM NOT AFRAID."

"WELL, THEN, I ONLY MEANT THAT YOUR ATTRIBUTING MY BROTHER'S WISH OF
DANCING WITH MISS THORPE TO GOOD NATURE ALONE CONVINCED ME OF YOUR BEING
SUPERIOR IN GOOD NATURE YOURSELF TO ALL THE REST OF THE WORLD."

CATHERINE BLUSHED AND DISCLAIMED, AND THE GENTLEMAN'S PREDICTIONS WERE
VERIFIED. THERE WAS A SOMETHING, HOWEVER, IN HIS WORDS WHICH REPAID HER
FOR THE PAIN OF CONFUSION; AND THAT SOMETHING OCCUPIED HER MIND SO MUCH
THAT SHE DREW BACK FOR SOME TIME, FORGETTING TO SPEAK OR TO LISTEN, AND
ALMOST FORGETTING WHERE SHE WAS; TILL, ROUSED BY THE VOICE OF ISABELLA,
SHE LOOKED UP AND SAW HER WITH CAPTAIN TILNEY PREPARING TO GIVE THEM
HANDS ACROSS.

ISABELLA SHRUGGED HER SHOULDERS AND SMILED, THE ONLY EXPLANATION OF THIS
EXTRAORDINARY CHANGE WHICH COULD AT THAT TIME BE GIVEN; BUT AS IT
WAS NOT QUITE ENOUGH FOR CATHERINE'S COMPREHENSION, SHE SPOKE HER
ASTONISHMENT IN VERY PLAIN TERMS TO HER PARTNER.

"I CANNOT THINK HOW IT COULD HAPPEN! ISABELLA WAS SO DETERMINED NOT TO
DANCE."

"AND DID ISABELLA NEVER CHANGE HER MIND BEFORE?"

"OH! BUT, BECAUSE--AND YOUR BROTHER! AFTER WHAT YOU TOLD HIM FROM ME,
HOW COULD HE THINK OF GOING TO ASK HER?"

"I CANNOT TAKE SURPRISE TO MYSELF ON THAT HEAD. YOU BID ME BE SURPRISED
ON YOUR FRIEND'S ACCOUNT, AND THEREFORE I AM; BUT AS FOR MY BROTHER, HIS
CONDUCT IN THE BUSINESS, I MUST OWN, HAS BEEN NO MORE THAN I BELIEVED
HIM PERFECTLY EQUAL TO. THE FAIRNESS OF YOUR FRIEND WAS AN OPEN
ATTRACTION; HER FIRMNESS, YOU KNOW, COULD ONLY BE UNDERSTOOD BY
YOURSELF."

"YOU ARE LAUGHING; BUT, I ASSURE YOU, ISABELLA IS VERY FIRM IN GENERAL."

"IT IS AS MUCH AS SHOULD BE SAID OF ANYONE. TO BE ALWAYS FIRM MUST BE
TO BE OFTEN OBSTINATE. WHEN PROPERLY TO RELAX IS THE TRIAL OF JUDGMENT;
AND, WITHOUT REFERENCE TO MY BROTHER, I REALLY THINK MISS THORPE HAS BY
NO MEANS CHOSEN ILL IN FIXING ON THE PRESENT HOUR."

THE FRIENDS WERE NOT ABLE TO GET TOGETHER FOR ANY CONFIDENTIAL DISCOURSE
TILL ALL THE DANCING WAS OVER; BUT THEN, AS THEY WALKED ABOUT THE ROOM
ARM IN ARM, ISABELLA THUS EXPLAINED HERSELF: "I DO NOT WONDER AT YOUR
SURPRISE; AND I AM REALLY FATIGUED TO DEATH. HE IS SUCH A RATTLE!
AMUSING ENOUGH, IF MY MIND HAD BEEN DISENGAGED; BUT I WOULD HAVE GIVEN
THE WORLD TO SIT STILL."

"THEN WHY DID NOT YOU?"

"OH! MY DEAR! IT WOULD HAVE LOOKED SO PARTICULAR; AND YOU KNOW HOW I
ABHOR DOING THAT. I REFUSED HIM AS LONG AS I POSSIBLY COULD, BUT HE
WOULD TAKE NO DENIAL. YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW HE PRESSED ME. I BEGGED HIM
TO EXCUSE ME, AND GET SOME OTHER PARTNER--BUT NO, NOT HE; AFTER ASPIRING
TO MY HAND, THERE WAS NOBODY ELSE IN THE ROOM HE COULD BEAR TO THINK OF;
AND IT WAS NOT THAT HE WANTED MERELY TO DANCE, HE WANTED TO BE WITH
ME. OH! SUCH NONSENSE! I TOLD HIM HE HAD TAKEN A VERY UNLIKELY WAY TO
PREVAIL UPON ME; FOR, OF ALL THINGS IN THE WORLD, I HATED FINE SPEECHES
AND COMPLIMENTS; AND SO--AND SO THEN I FOUND THERE WOULD BE NO PEACE IF
I DID NOT STAND UP. BESIDES, I THOUGHT MRS. HUGHES, WHO INTRODUCED HIM,
MIGHT TAKE IT ILL IF I DID NOT: AND YOUR DEAR BROTHER, I AM SURE HE
WOULD HAVE BEEN MISERABLE IF I HAD SAT DOWN THE WHOLE EVENING. I AM
SO GLAD IT IS OVER! MY SPIRITS ARE QUITE JADED WITH LISTENING TO HIS
NONSENSE: AND THEN, BEING SUCH A SMART YOUNG FELLOW, I SAW EVERY EYE WAS
UPON US."

"HE IS VERY HANDSOME INDEED."

"HANDSOME! YES, I SUPPOSE HE MAY. I DARE SAY PEOPLE WOULD ADMIRE HIM
IN GENERAL; BUT HE IS NOT AT ALL IN MY STYLE OF BEAUTY. I HATE A FLORID
COMPLEXION AND DARK EYES IN A MAN. HOWEVER, HE IS VERY WELL. AMAZINGLY
CONCEITED, I AM SURE. I TOOK HIM DOWN SEVERAL TIMES, YOU KNOW, IN MY
WAY."

WHEN THE YOUNG LADIES NEXT MET, THEY HAD A FAR MORE INTERESTING SUBJECT
TO DISCUSS. JAMES MORLAND'S SECOND LETTER WAS THEN RECEIVED, AND THE
KIND INTENTIONS OF HIS FATHER FULLY EXPLAINED. A LIVING, OF WHICH MR.
MORLAND WAS HIMSELF PATRON AND INCUMBENT, OF ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED POUNDS
YEARLY VALUE, WAS TO BE RESIGNED TO HIS SON AS SOON AS HE SHOULD BE
OLD ENOUGH TO TAKE IT; NO TRIFLING DEDUCTION FROM THE FAMILY INCOME, NO
NIGGARDLY ASSIGNMENT TO ONE OF TEN CHILDREN. AN ESTATE OF AT LEAST EQUAL
VALUE, MOREOVER, WAS ASSURED AS HIS FUTURE INHERITANCE.

JAMES EXPRESSED HIMSELF ON THE OCCASION WITH BECOMING GRATITUDE; AND
THE NECESSITY OF WAITING BETWEEN TWO AND THREE YEARS BEFORE THEY COULD
MARRY, BEING, HOWEVER UNWELCOME, NO MORE THAN HE HAD EXPECTED, WAS BORNE
BY HIM WITHOUT DISCONTENT. CATHERINE, WHOSE EXPECTATIONS HAD BEEN AS
UNFIXED AS HER IDEAS OF HER FATHER'S INCOME, AND WHOSE JUDGMENT WAS NOW
ENTIRELY LED BY HER BROTHER, FELT EQUALLY WELL SATISFIED, AND HEARTILY
CONGRATULATED ISABELLA ON HAVING EVERYTHING SO PLEASANTLY SETTLED.

"IT IS VERY CHARMING INDEED," SAID ISABELLA, WITH A GRAVE FACE. "MR.
MORLAND HAS BEHAVED VASTLY HANDSOME INDEED," SAID THE GENTLE MRS.
THORPE, LOOKING ANXIOUSLY AT HER DAUGHTER. "I ONLY WISH I COULD DO AS
MUCH. ONE COULD NOT EXPECT MORE FROM HIM, YOU KNOW. IF HE FINDS HE
CAN DO MORE BY AND BY, I DARE SAY HE WILL, FOR I AM SURE HE MUST BE AN
EXCELLENT GOOD-HEARTED MAN. FOUR HUNDRED IS BUT A SMALL INCOME TO BEGIN
ON INDEED, BUT YOUR WISHES, MY DEAR ISABELLA, ARE SO MODERATE, YOU DO
NOT CONSIDER HOW LITTLE YOU EVER WANT, MY DEAR."

"IT IS NOT ON MY OWN ACCOUNT I WISH FOR MORE; BUT I CANNOT BEAR TO
BE THE MEANS OF INJURING MY DEAR MORLAND, MAKING HIM SIT DOWN UPON AN
INCOME HARDLY ENOUGH TO FIND ONE IN THE COMMON NECESSARIES OF LIFE. FOR
MYSELF, IT IS NOTHING; I NEVER THINK OF MYSELF."

"I KNOW YOU NEVER DO, MY DEAR; AND YOU WILL ALWAYS FIND YOUR REWARD IN
THE AFFECTION IT MAKES EVERYBODY FEEL FOR YOU. THERE NEVER WAS A YOUNG
WOMAN SO BELOVED AS YOU ARE BY EVERYBODY THAT KNOWS YOU; AND I DARE SAY
WHEN MR. MORLAND SEES YOU, MY DEAR CHILD--BUT DO NOT LET US DISTRESS
OUR DEAR CATHERINE BY TALKING OF SUCH THINGS. MR. MORLAND HAS BEHAVED SO
VERY HANDSOME, YOU KNOW. I ALWAYS HEARD HE WAS A MOST EXCELLENT MAN;
AND YOU KNOW, MY DEAR, WE ARE NOT TO SUPPOSE BUT WHAT, IF YOU HAD HAD A
SUITABLE FORTUNE, HE WOULD HAVE COME DOWN WITH SOMETHING MORE, FOR I AM
SURE HE MUST BE A MOST LIBERAL-MINDED MAN."

"NOBODY CAN THINK BETTER OF MR. MORLAND THAN I DO, I AM SURE. BUT
EVERYBODY HAS THEIR FAILING, YOU KNOW, AND EVERYBODY HAS A RIGHT TO
DO WHAT THEY LIKE WITH THEIR OWN MONEY." CATHERINE WAS HURT BY THESE
INSINUATIONS. "I AM VERY SURE," SAID SHE, "THAT MY FATHER HAS PROMISED
TO DO AS MUCH AS HE CAN AFFORD."

ISABELLA RECOLLECTED HERSELF. "AS TO THAT, MY SWEET CATHERINE, THERE
CANNOT BE A DOUBT, AND YOU KNOW ME WELL ENOUGH TO BE SURE THAT A MUCH
SMALLER INCOME WOULD SATISFY ME. IT IS NOT THE WANT OF MORE MONEY THAT
MAKES ME JUST AT PRESENT A LITTLE OUT OF SPIRITS; I HATE MONEY; AND IF
OUR UNION COULD TAKE PLACE NOW UPON ONLY FIFTY POUNDS A YEAR, I SHOULD
NOT HAVE A WISH UNSATISFIED. AH! MY CATHERINE, YOU HAVE FOUND ME OUT.
THERE'S THE STING. THE LONG, LONG, ENDLESS TWO YEARS AND HALF THAT ARE
TO PASS BEFORE YOUR BROTHER CAN HOLD THE LIVING."

"YES, YES, MY DARLING ISABELLA," SAID MRS. THORPE, "WE PERFECTLY SEE
INTO YOUR HEART. YOU HAVE NO DISGUISE. WE PERFECTLY UNDERSTAND THE
PRESENT VEXATION; AND EVERYBODY MUST LOVE YOU THE BETTER FOR SUCH A
NOBLE HONEST AFFECTION."

CATHERINE'S UNCOMFORTABLE FEELINGS BEGAN TO LESSEN. SHE ENDEAVOURED TO
BELIEVE THAT THE DELAY OF THE MARRIAGE WAS THE ONLY SOURCE OF ISABELLA'S
REGRET; AND WHEN SHE SAW HER AT THEIR NEXT INTERVIEW AS CHEERFUL AND
AMIABLE AS EVER, ENDEAVOURED TO FORGET THAT SHE HAD FOR A MINUTE THOUGHT
OTHERWISE. JAMES SOON FOLLOWED HIS LETTER, AND WAS RECEIVED WITH THE
MOST GRATIFYING KINDNESS.




CHAPTER 17


THE ALLENS HAD NOW ENTERED ON THE SIXTH WEEK OF THEIR STAY IN BATH; AND
WHETHER IT SHOULD BE THE LAST WAS FOR SOME TIME A QUESTION, TO WHICH
CATHERINE LISTENED WITH A BEATING HEART. TO HAVE HER ACQUAINTANCE WITH
THE TILNEYS END SO SOON WAS AN EVIL WHICH NOTHING COULD COUNTERBALANCE.
HER WHOLE HAPPINESS SEEMED AT STAKE, WHILE THE AFFAIR WAS IN SUSPENSE,
AND EVERYTHING SECURED WHEN IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE LODGINGS SHOULD
BE TAKEN FOR ANOTHER FORTNIGHT. WHAT THIS ADDITIONAL FORTNIGHT WAS TO
PRODUCE TO HER BEYOND THE PLEASURE OF SOMETIMES SEEING HENRY TILNEY MADE
BUT A SMALL PART OF CATHERINE'S SPECULATION. ONCE OR TWICE INDEED, SINCE
JAMES'S ENGAGEMENT HAD TAUGHT HER WHAT COULD BE DONE, SHE HAD GOT SO
FAR AS TO INDULGE IN A SECRET "PERHAPS," BUT IN GENERAL THE FELICITY OF
BEING WITH HIM FOR THE PRESENT BOUNDED HER VIEWS: THE PRESENT WAS NOW
COMPRISED IN ANOTHER THREE WEEKS, AND HER HAPPINESS BEING CERTAIN FOR
THAT PERIOD, THE REST OF HER LIFE WAS AT SUCH A DISTANCE AS TO EXCITE
BUT LITTLE INTEREST. IN THE COURSE OF THE MORNING WHICH SAW THIS
BUSINESS ARRANGED, SHE VISITED MISS TILNEY, AND POURED FORTH HER
JOYFUL FEELINGS. IT WAS DOOMED TO BE A DAY OF TRIAL. NO SOONER HAD SHE
EXPRESSED HER DELIGHT IN MR. ALLEN'S LENGTHENED STAY THAN MISS TILNEY
TOLD HER OF HER FATHER'S HAVING JUST DETERMINED UPON QUITTING BATH
BY THE END OF ANOTHER WEEK. HERE WAS A BLOW! THE PAST SUSPENSE OF
THE MORNING HAD BEEN EASE AND QUIET TO THE PRESENT DISAPPOINTMENT.
CATHERINE'S COUNTENANCE FELL, AND IN A VOICE OF MOST SINCERE CONCERN SHE
ECHOED MISS TILNEY'S CONCLUDING WORDS, "BY THE END OF ANOTHER WEEK!"

"YES, MY FATHER CAN SELDOM BE PREVAILED ON TO GIVE THE WATERS WHAT I
THINK A FAIR TRIAL. HE HAS BEEN DISAPPOINTED OF SOME FRIENDS' ARRIVAL
WHOM HE EXPECTED TO MEET HERE, AND AS HE IS NOW PRETTY WELL, IS IN A
HURRY TO GET HOME."

"I AM VERY SORRY FOR IT," SAID CATHERINE DEJECTEDLY; "IF I HAD KNOWN
THIS BEFORE--"

"PERHAPS," SAID MISS TILNEY IN AN EMBARRASSED MANNER, "YOU WOULD BE SO
GOOD--IT WOULD MAKE ME VERY HAPPY IF--"

THE ENTRANCE OF HER FATHER PUT A STOP TO THE CIVILITY, WHICH CATHERINE
WAS BEGINNING TO HOPE MIGHT INTRODUCE A DESIRE OF THEIR CORRESPONDING.
AFTER ADDRESSING HER WITH HIS USUAL POLITENESS, HE TURNED TO HIS
DAUGHTER AND SAID, "WELL, ELEANOR, MAY I CONGRATULATE YOU ON BEING
SUCCESSFUL IN YOUR APPLICATION TO YOUR FAIR FRIEND?"

"I WAS JUST BEGINNING TO MAKE THE REQUEST, SIR, AS YOU CAME IN."

"WELL, PROCEED BY ALL MEANS. I KNOW HOW MUCH YOUR HEART IS IN IT. MY
DAUGHTER, MISS MORLAND," HE CONTINUED, WITHOUT LEAVING HIS DAUGHTER TIME
TO SPEAK, "HAS BEEN FORMING A VERY BOLD WISH. WE LEAVE BATH, AS SHE HAS
PERHAPS TOLD YOU, ON SATURDAY SE'NNIGHT. A LETTER FROM MY STEWARD TELLS
ME THAT MY PRESENCE IS WANTED AT HOME; AND BEING DISAPPOINTED IN MY HOPE
OF SEEING THE MARQUIS OF LONGTOWN AND GENERAL COURTENEY HERE, SOME OF
MY VERY OLD FRIENDS, THERE IS NOTHING TO DETAIN ME LONGER IN BATH. AND
COULD WE CARRY OUR SELFISH POINT WITH YOU, WE SHOULD LEAVE IT WITHOUT A
SINGLE REGRET. CAN YOU, IN SHORT, BE PREVAILED ON TO QUIT THIS SCENE
OF PUBLIC TRIUMPH AND OBLIGE YOUR FRIEND ELEANOR WITH YOUR COMPANY IN
GLOUCESTERSHIRE? I AM ALMOST ASHAMED TO MAKE THE REQUEST, THOUGH ITS
PRESUMPTION WOULD CERTAINLY APPEAR GREATER TO EVERY CREATURE IN BATH
THAN YOURSELF. MODESTY SUCH AS YOURS--BUT NOT FOR THE WORLD WOULD I PAIN
IT BY OPEN PRAISE. IF YOU CAN BE INDUCED TO HONOUR US WITH A VISIT,
YOU WILL MAKE US HAPPY BEYOND EXPRESSION. 'TIS TRUE, WE CAN OFFER YOU
NOTHING LIKE THE GAIETIES OF THIS LIVELY PLACE; WE CAN TEMPT YOU NEITHER
BY AMUSEMENT NOR SPLENDOUR, FOR OUR MODE OF LIVING, AS YOU SEE, IS PLAIN
AND UNPRETENDING; YET NO ENDEAVOURS SHALL BE WANTING ON OUR SIDE TO MAKE
NORTHANGER ABBEY NOT WHOLLY DISAGREEABLE."

NORTHANGER ABBEY! THESE WERE THRILLING WORDS, AND WOUND UP CATHERINE'S
FEELINGS TO THE HIGHEST POINT OF ECSTASY. HER GRATEFUL AND GRATIFIED
HEART COULD HARDLY RESTRAIN ITS EXPRESSIONS WITHIN THE LANGUAGE OF
TOLERABLE CALMNESS. TO RECEIVE SO FLATTERING AN INVITATION! TO HAVE HER
COMPANY SO WARMLY SOLICITED! EVERYTHING HONOURABLE AND SOOTHING, EVERY
PRESENT ENJOYMENT, AND EVERY FUTURE HOPE WAS CONTAINED IN IT; AND HER
ACCEPTANCE, WITH ONLY THE SAVING CLAUSE OF PAPA AND MAMMA'S APPROBATION,
WAS EAGERLY GIVEN. "I WILL WRITE HOME DIRECTLY," SAID SHE, "AND IF THEY
DO NOT OBJECT, AS I DARE SAY THEY WILL NOT--"

GENERAL TILNEY WAS NOT LESS SANGUINE, HAVING ALREADY WAITED ON HER
EXCELLENT FRIENDS IN PULTENEY STREET, AND OBTAINED THEIR SANCTION OF
HIS WISHES. "SINCE THEY CAN CONSENT TO PART WITH YOU," SAID HE, "WE MAY
EXPECT PHILOSOPHY FROM ALL THE WORLD."

MISS TILNEY WAS EARNEST, THOUGH GENTLE, IN HER SECONDARY CIVILITIES, AND
THE AFFAIR BECAME IN A FEW MINUTES AS NEARLY SETTLED AS THIS NECESSARY
REFERENCE TO FULLERTON WOULD ALLOW.

THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE MORNING HAD LED CATHERINE'S FEELINGS THROUGH
THE VARIETIES OF SUSPENSE, SECURITY, AND DISAPPOINTMENT; BUT THEY WERE
NOW SAFELY LODGED IN PERFECT BLISS; AND WITH SPIRITS ELATED TO RAPTURE,
WITH HENRY AT HER HEART, AND NORTHANGER ABBEY ON HER LIPS, SHE
HURRIED HOME TO WRITE HER LETTER. MR. AND MRS. MORLAND, RELYING ON
THE DISCRETION OF THE FRIENDS TO WHOM THEY HAD ALREADY ENTRUSTED THEIR
DAUGHTER, FELT NO DOUBT OF THE PROPRIETY OF AN ACQUAINTANCE WHICH HAD
BEEN FORMED UNDER THEIR EYE, AND SENT THEREFORE BY RETURN OF POST THEIR
READY CONSENT TO HER VISIT IN GLOUCESTERSHIRE. THIS INDULGENCE, THOUGH
NOT MORE THAN CATHERINE HAD HOPED FOR, COMPLETED HER CONVICTION OF BEING
FAVOURED BEYOND EVERY OTHER HUMAN CREATURE, IN FRIENDS AND FORTUNE,
CIRCUMSTANCE AND CHANCE. EVERYTHING SEEMED TO COOPERATE FOR HER
ADVANTAGE. BY THE KINDNESS OF HER FIRST FRIENDS, THE ALLENS, SHE HAD
BEEN INTRODUCED INTO SCENES WHERE PLEASURES OF EVERY KIND HAD MET HER.
HER FEELINGS, HER PREFERENCES, HAD EACH KNOWN THE HAPPINESS OF A RETURN.
WHEREVER SHE FELT ATTACHMENT, SHE HAD BEEN ABLE TO CREATE IT. THE
AFFECTION OF ISABELLA WAS TO BE SECURED TO HER IN A SISTER. THE TILNEYS,
THEY, BY WHOM, ABOVE ALL, SHE DESIRED TO BE FAVOURABLY THOUGHT OF,
OUTSTRIPPED EVEN HER WISHES IN THE FLATTERING MEASURES BY WHICH THEIR
INTIMACY WAS TO BE CONTINUED. SHE WAS TO BE THEIR CHOSEN VISITOR, SHE
WAS TO BE FOR WEEKS UNDER THE SAME ROOF WITH THE PERSON WHOSE SOCIETY
SHE MOSTLY PRIZED--AND, IN ADDITION TO ALL THE REST, THIS ROOF WAS TO
BE THE ROOF OF AN ABBEY! HER PASSION FOR ANCIENT EDIFICES WAS NEXT IN
DEGREE TO HER PASSION FOR HENRY TILNEY--AND CASTLES AND ABBEYS MADE
USUALLY THE CHARM OF THOSE REVERIES WHICH HIS IMAGE DID NOT FILL. TO SEE
AND EXPLORE EITHER THE RAMPARTS AND KEEP OF THE ONE, OR THE CLOISTERS
OF THE OTHER, HAD BEEN FOR MANY WEEKS A DARLING WISH, THOUGH TO BE MORE
THAN THE VISITOR OF AN HOUR HAD SEEMED TOO NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR DESIRE.
AND YET, THIS WAS TO HAPPEN. WITH ALL THE CHANCES AGAINST HER OF HOUSE,
HALL, PLACE, PARK, COURT, AND COTTAGE, NORTHANGER TURNED UP AN ABBEY,
AND SHE WAS TO BE ITS INHABITANT. ITS LONG, DAMP PASSAGES, ITS NARROW
CELLS AND RUINED CHAPEL, WERE TO BE WITHIN HER DAILY REACH, AND SHE
COULD NOT ENTIRELY SUBDUE THE HOPE OF SOME TRADITIONAL LEGENDS, SOME
AWFUL MEMORIALS OF AN INJURED AND ILL-FATED NUN.

IT WAS WONDERFUL THAT HER FRIENDS SHOULD SEEM SO LITTLE ELATED BY THE
POSSESSION OF SUCH A HOME, THAT THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF IT SHOULD BE SO
MEEKLY BORNE. THE POWER OF EARLY HABIT ONLY COULD ACCOUNT FOR IT. A
DISTINCTION TO WHICH THEY HAD BEEN BORN GAVE NO PRIDE. THEIR SUPERIORITY
OF ABODE WAS NO MORE TO THEM THAN THEIR SUPERIORITY OF PERSON.

MANY WERE THE INQUIRIES SHE WAS EAGER TO MAKE OF MISS TILNEY; BUT SO
ACTIVE WERE HER THOUGHTS, THAT WHEN THESE INQUIRIES WERE ANSWERED, SHE
WAS HARDLY MORE ASSURED THAN BEFORE, OF NORTHANGER ABBEY HAVING BEEN
A RICHLY ENDOWED CONVENT AT THE TIME OF THE REFORMATION, OF ITS HAVING
FALLEN INTO THE HANDS OF AN ANCESTOR OF THE TILNEYS ON ITS DISSOLUTION,
OF A LARGE PORTION OF THE ANCIENT BUILDING STILL MAKING A PART OF THE
PRESENT DWELLING ALTHOUGH THE REST WAS DECAYED, OR OF ITS STANDING LOW
IN A VALLEY, SHELTERED FROM THE NORTH AND EAST BY RISING WOODS OF OAK.




CHAPTER 18


WITH A MIND THUS FULL OF HAPPINESS, CATHERINE WAS HARDLY AWARE THAT TWO
OR THREE DAYS HAD PASSED AWAY, WITHOUT HER SEEING ISABELLA FOR MORE THAN
A FEW MINUTES TOGETHER. SHE BEGAN FIRST TO BE SENSIBLE OF THIS, AND
TO SIGH FOR HER CONVERSATION, AS SHE WALKED ALONG THE PUMP-ROOM ONE
MORNING, BY MRS. ALLEN'S SIDE, WITHOUT ANYTHING TO SAY OR TO HEAR; AND
SCARCELY HAD SHE FELT A FIVE MINUTES' LONGING OF FRIENDSHIP, BEFORE THE
OBJECT OF IT APPEARED, AND INVITING HER TO A SECRET CONFERENCE, LED THE
WAY TO A SEAT. "THIS IS MY FAVOURITE PLACE," SAID SHE AS THEY SAT
DOWN ON A BENCH BETWEEN THE DOORS, WHICH COMMANDED A TOLERABLE VIEW OF
EVERYBODY ENTERING AT EITHER; "IT IS SO OUT OF THE WAY."

CATHERINE, OBSERVING THAT ISABELLA'S EYES WERE CONTINUALLY BENT TOWARDS
ONE DOOR OR THE OTHER, AS IN EAGER EXPECTATION, AND REMEMBERING HOW
OFTEN SHE HAD BEEN FALSELY ACCUSED OF BEING ARCH, THOUGHT THE PRESENT A
FINE OPPORTUNITY FOR BEING REALLY SO; AND THEREFORE GAILY SAID, "DO NOT
BE UNEASY, ISABELLA, JAMES WILL SOON BE HERE."

"PSHA! MY DEAR CREATURE," SHE REPLIED, "DO NOT THINK ME SUCH A SIMPLETON
AS TO BE ALWAYS WANTING TO CONFINE HIM TO MY ELBOW. IT WOULD BE HIDEOUS
TO BE ALWAYS TOGETHER; WE SHOULD BE THE JEST OF THE PLACE. AND SO YOU
ARE GOING TO NORTHANGER! I AM AMAZINGLY GLAD OF IT. IT IS ONE OF THE
FINEST OLD PLACES IN ENGLAND, I UNDERSTAND. I SHALL DEPEND UPON A MOST
PARTICULAR DESCRIPTION OF IT."

"YOU SHALL CERTAINLY HAVE THE BEST IN MY POWER TO GIVE. BUT WHO ARE YOU
LOOKING FOR? ARE YOUR SISTERS COMING?"

"I AM NOT LOOKING FOR ANYBODY. ONE'S EYES MUST BE SOMEWHERE, AND YOU
KNOW WHAT A FOOLISH TRICK I HAVE OF FIXING MINE, WHEN MY THOUGHTS ARE AN
HUNDRED MILES OFF. I AM AMAZINGLY ABSENT; I BELIEVE I AM THE MOST ABSENT
CREATURE IN THE WORLD. TILNEY SAYS IT IS ALWAYS THE CASE WITH MINDS OF A
CERTAIN STAMP."

"BUT I THOUGHT, ISABELLA, YOU HAD SOMETHING IN PARTICULAR TO TELL ME?"

"OH! YES, AND SO I HAVE. BUT HERE IS A PROOF OF WHAT I WAS SAYING. MY
POOR HEAD, I HAD QUITE FORGOT IT. WELL, THE THING IS THIS: I HAVE JUST
HAD A LETTER FROM JOHN; YOU CAN GUESS THE CONTENTS."

"NO, INDEED, I CANNOT."

"MY SWEET LOVE, DO NOT BE SO ABOMINABLY AFFECTED. WHAT CAN HE WRITE
ABOUT, BUT YOURSELF? YOU KNOW HE IS OVER HEAD AND EARS IN LOVE WITH
YOU."

"WITH ME, DEAR ISABELLA!"

"NAY, MY SWEETEST CATHERINE, THIS IS BEING QUITE ABSURD! MODESTY, AND
ALL THAT, IS VERY WELL IN ITS WAY, BUT REALLY A LITTLE COMMON HONESTY IS
SOMETIMES QUITE AS BECOMING. I HAVE NO IDEA OF BEING SO OVERSTRAINED!
IT IS FISHING FOR COMPLIMENTS. HIS ATTENTIONS WERE SUCH AS A CHILD MUST
HAVE NOTICED. AND IT WAS BUT HALF AN HOUR BEFORE HE LEFT BATH THAT YOU
GAVE HIM THE MOST POSITIVE ENCOURAGEMENT. HE SAYS SO IN THIS LETTER,
SAYS THAT HE AS GOOD AS MADE YOU AN OFFER, AND THAT YOU RECEIVED HIS
ADVANCES IN THE KINDEST WAY; AND NOW HE WANTS ME TO URGE HIS SUIT,
AND SAY ALL MANNER OF PRETTY THINGS TO YOU. SO IT IS IN VAIN TO AFFECT
IGNORANCE."

CATHERINE, WITH ALL THE EARNESTNESS OF TRUTH, EXPRESSED HER ASTONISHMENT
AT SUCH A CHARGE, PROTESTING HER INNOCENCE OF EVERY THOUGHT OF MR.
THORPE'S BEING IN LOVE WITH HER, AND THE CONSEQUENT IMPOSSIBILITY OF
HER HAVING EVER INTENDED TO ENCOURAGE HIM. "AS TO ANY ATTENTIONS ON HIS
SIDE, I DO DECLARE, UPON MY HONOUR, I NEVER WAS SENSIBLE OF THEM FOR A
MOMENT--EXCEPT JUST HIS ASKING ME TO DANCE THE FIRST DAY OF HIS COMING.
AND AS TO MAKING ME AN OFFER, OR ANYTHING LIKE IT, THERE MUST BE SOME
UNACCOUNTABLE MISTAKE. I COULD NOT HAVE MISUNDERSTOOD A THING OF THAT
KIND, YOU KNOW! AND, AS I EVER WISH TO BE BELIEVED, I SOLEMNLY PROTEST
THAT NO SYLLABLE OF SUCH A NATURE EVER PASSED BETWEEN US. THE LAST HALF
HOUR BEFORE HE WENT AWAY! IT MUST BE ALL AND COMPLETELY A MISTAKE--FOR I
DID NOT SEE HIM ONCE THAT WHOLE MORNING."

"BUT THAT YOU CERTAINLY DID, FOR YOU SPENT THE WHOLE MORNING IN EDGAR'S
BUILDINGS--IT WAS THE DAY YOUR FATHER'S CONSENT CAME--AND I AM PRETTY
SURE THAT YOU AND JOHN WERE ALONE IN THE PARLOUR SOME TIME BEFORE YOU
LEFT THE HOUSE."

"ARE YOU? WELL, IF YOU SAY IT, IT WAS SO, I DARE SAY--BUT FOR THE LIFE
OF ME, I CANNOT RECOLLECT IT. I DO REMEMBER NOW BEING WITH YOU, AND
SEEING HIM AS WELL AS THE REST--BUT THAT WE WERE EVER ALONE FOR FIVE
MINUTES--HOWEVER, IT IS NOT WORTH ARGUING ABOUT, FOR WHATEVER MIGHT PASS
ON HIS SIDE, YOU MUST BE CONVINCED, BY MY HAVING NO RECOLLECTION OF IT,
THAT I NEVER THOUGHT, NOR EXPECTED, NOR WISHED FOR ANYTHING OF THE KIND
FROM HIM. I AM EXCESSIVELY CONCERNED THAT HE SHOULD HAVE ANY REGARD FOR
ME--BUT INDEED IT HAS BEEN QUITE UNINTENTIONAL ON MY SIDE; I NEVER HAD
THE SMALLEST IDEA OF IT. PRAY UNDECEIVE HIM AS SOON AS YOU CAN, AND TELL
HIM I BEG HIS PARDON--THAT IS--I DO NOT KNOW WHAT I OUGHT TO SAY--BUT
MAKE HIM UNDERSTAND WHAT I MEAN, IN THE PROPEREST WAY. I WOULD NOT SPEAK
DISRESPECTFULLY OF A BROTHER OF YOURS, ISABELLA, I AM SURE; BUT YOU KNOW
VERY WELL THAT IF I COULD THINK OF ONE MAN MORE THAN ANOTHER--HE IS NOT
THE PERSON." ISABELLA WAS SILENT. "MY DEAR FRIEND, YOU MUST NOT BE ANGRY
WITH ME. I CANNOT SUPPOSE YOUR BROTHER CARES SO VERY MUCH ABOUT ME. AND,
YOU KNOW, WE SHALL STILL BE SISTERS."

"YES, YES" (WITH A BLUSH), "THERE ARE MORE WAYS THAN ONE OF OUR BEING
SISTERS. BUT WHERE AM I WANDERING TO? WELL, MY DEAR CATHERINE, THE CASE
SEEMS TO BE THAT YOU ARE DETERMINED AGAINST POOR JOHN--IS NOT IT SO?"

"I CERTAINLY CANNOT RETURN HIS AFFECTION, AND AS CERTAINLY NEVER MEANT
TO ENCOURAGE IT."

"SINCE THAT IS THE CASE, I AM SURE I SHALL NOT TEASE YOU ANY FURTHER.
JOHN DESIRED ME TO SPEAK TO YOU ON THE SUBJECT, AND THEREFORE I HAVE.
BUT I CONFESS, AS SOON AS I READ HIS LETTER, I THOUGHT IT A VERY
FOOLISH, IMPRUDENT BUSINESS, AND NOT LIKELY TO PROMOTE THE GOOD OF
EITHER; FOR WHAT WERE YOU TO LIVE UPON, SUPPOSING YOU CAME TOGETHER? YOU
HAVE BOTH OF YOU SOMETHING, TO BE SURE, BUT IT IS NOT A TRIFLE THAT WILL
SUPPORT A FAMILY NOWADAYS; AND AFTER ALL THAT ROMANCERS MAY SAY, THERE
IS NO DOING WITHOUT MONEY. I ONLY WONDER JOHN COULD THINK OF IT; HE
COULD NOT HAVE RECEIVED MY LAST."

"YOU DO ACQUIT ME, THEN, OF ANYTHING WRONG?--YOU ARE CONVINCED THAT I
NEVER MEANT TO DECEIVE YOUR BROTHER, NEVER SUSPECTED HIM OF LIKING ME
TILL THIS MOMENT?"

"OH! AS TO THAT," ANSWERED ISABELLA LAUGHINGLY, "I DO NOT PRETEND TO
DETERMINE WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS AND DESIGNS IN TIME PAST MAY HAVE BEEN. ALL
THAT IS BEST KNOWN TO YOURSELF. A LITTLE HARMLESS FLIRTATION OR SO WILL
OCCUR, AND ONE IS OFTEN DRAWN ON TO GIVE MORE ENCOURAGEMENT THAN ONE
WISHES TO STAND BY. BUT YOU MAY BE ASSURED THAT I AM THE LAST PERSON IN
THE WORLD TO JUDGE YOU SEVERELY. ALL THOSE THINGS SHOULD BE ALLOWED FOR
IN YOUTH AND HIGH SPIRITS. WHAT ONE MEANS ONE DAY, YOU KNOW, ONE MAY NOT
MEAN THE NEXT. CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE, OPINIONS ALTER."

"BUT MY OPINION OF YOUR BROTHER NEVER DID ALTER; IT WAS ALWAYS THE SAME.
YOU ARE DESCRIBING WHAT NEVER HAPPENED."

"MY DEAREST CATHERINE," CONTINUED THE OTHER WITHOUT AT ALL LISTENING TO
HER, "I WOULD NOT FOR ALL THE WORLD BE THE MEANS OF HURRYING YOU INTO AN
ENGAGEMENT BEFORE YOU KNEW WHAT YOU WERE ABOUT. I DO NOT THINK ANYTHING
WOULD JUSTIFY ME IN WISHING YOU TO SACRIFICE ALL YOUR HAPPINESS MERELY
TO OBLIGE MY BROTHER, BECAUSE HE IS MY BROTHER, AND WHO PERHAPS AFTER
ALL, YOU KNOW, MIGHT BE JUST AS HAPPY WITHOUT YOU, FOR PEOPLE SELDOM
KNOW WHAT THEY WOULD BE AT, YOUNG MEN ESPECIALLY, THEY ARE SO AMAZINGLY
CHANGEABLE AND INCONSTANT. WHAT I SAY IS, WHY SHOULD A BROTHER'S
HAPPINESS BE DEARER TO ME THAN A FRIEND'S? YOU KNOW I CARRY MY NOTIONS
OF FRIENDSHIP PRETTY HIGH. BUT, ABOVE ALL THINGS, MY DEAR CATHERINE, DO
NOT BE IN A HURRY. TAKE MY WORD FOR IT, THAT IF YOU ARE IN TOO GREAT
A HURRY, YOU WILL CERTAINLY LIVE TO REPENT IT. TILNEY SAYS THERE IS
NOTHING PEOPLE ARE SO OFTEN DECEIVED IN AS THE STATE OF THEIR OWN
AFFECTIONS, AND I BELIEVE HE IS VERY RIGHT. AH! HERE HE COMES; NEVER
MIND, HE WILL NOT SEE US, I AM SURE."

CATHERINE, LOOKING UP, PERCEIVED CAPTAIN TILNEY; AND ISABELLA,
EARNESTLY FIXING HER EYE ON HIM AS SHE SPOKE, SOON CAUGHT HIS NOTICE. HE
APPROACHED IMMEDIATELY, AND TOOK THE SEAT TO WHICH HER MOVEMENTS INVITED
HIM. HIS FIRST ADDRESS MADE CATHERINE START. THOUGH SPOKEN LOW, SHE
COULD DISTINGUISH, "WHAT! ALWAYS TO BE WATCHED, IN PERSON OR BY PROXY!"

"PSHA, NONSENSE!" WAS ISABELLA'S ANSWER IN THE SAME HALF WHISPER. "WHY
DO YOU PUT SUCH THINGS INTO MY HEAD? IF I COULD BELIEVE IT--MY SPIRIT,
YOU KNOW, IS PRETTY INDEPENDENT."

"I WISH YOUR HEART WERE INDEPENDENT. THAT WOULD BE ENOUGH FOR ME."

"MY HEART, INDEED! WHAT CAN YOU HAVE TO DO WITH HEARTS? YOU MEN HAVE
NONE OF YOU ANY HEARTS."

"IF WE HAVE NOT HEARTS, WE HAVE EYES; AND THEY GIVE US TORMENT ENOUGH."

"DO THEY? I AM SORRY FOR IT; I AM SORRY THEY FIND ANYTHING SO
DISAGREEABLE IN ME. I WILL LOOK ANOTHER WAY. I HOPE THIS PLEASES YOU"
(TURNING HER BACK ON HIM); "I HOPE YOUR EYES ARE NOT TORMENTED NOW."

"NEVER MORE SO; FOR THE EDGE OF A BLOOMING CHEEK IS STILL IN VIEW--AT
ONCE TOO MUCH AND TOO LITTLE."

CATHERINE HEARD ALL THIS, AND QUITE OUT OF COUNTENANCE, COULD LISTEN
NO LONGER. AMAZED THAT ISABELLA COULD ENDURE IT, AND JEALOUS FOR HER
BROTHER, SHE ROSE UP, AND SAYING SHE SHOULD JOIN MRS. ALLEN, PROPOSED
THEIR WALKING. BUT FOR THIS ISABELLA SHOWED NO INCLINATION. SHE WAS SO
AMAZINGLY TIRED, AND IT WAS SO ODIOUS TO PARADE ABOUT THE PUMP-ROOM;
AND IF SHE MOVED FROM HER SEAT SHE SHOULD MISS HER SISTERS; SHE WAS
EXPECTING HER SISTERS EVERY MOMENT; SO THAT HER DEAREST CATHERINE MUST
EXCUSE HER, AND MUST SIT QUIETLY DOWN AGAIN. BUT CATHERINE COULD BE
STUBBORN TOO; AND MRS. ALLEN JUST THEN COMING UP TO PROPOSE THEIR
RETURNING HOME, SHE JOINED HER AND WALKED OUT OF THE PUMP-ROOM, LEAVING
ISABELLA STILL SITTING WITH CAPTAIN TILNEY. WITH MUCH UNEASINESS DID
SHE THUS LEAVE THEM. IT SEEMED TO HER THAT CAPTAIN TILNEY WAS FALLING
IN LOVE WITH ISABELLA, AND ISABELLA UNCONSCIOUSLY ENCOURAGING HIM;
UNCONSCIOUSLY IT MUST BE, FOR ISABELLA'S ATTACHMENT TO JAMES WAS AS
CERTAIN AND WELL ACKNOWLEDGED AS HER ENGAGEMENT. TO DOUBT HER TRUTH
OR GOOD INTENTIONS WAS IMPOSSIBLE; AND YET, DURING THE WHOLE OF THEIR
CONVERSATION HER MANNER HAD BEEN ODD. SHE WISHED ISABELLA HAD TALKED
MORE LIKE HER USUAL SELF, AND NOT SO MUCH ABOUT MONEY, AND HAD NOT
LOOKED SO WELL PLEASED AT THE SIGHT OF CAPTAIN TILNEY. HOW STRANGE THAT
SHE SHOULD NOT PERCEIVE HIS ADMIRATION! CATHERINE LONGED TO GIVE HER A
HINT OF IT, TO PUT HER ON HER GUARD, AND PREVENT ALL THE PAIN WHICH
HER TOO LIVELY BEHAVIOUR MIGHT OTHERWISE CREATE BOTH FOR HIM AND HER
BROTHER.

THE COMPLIMENT OF JOHN THORPE'S AFFECTION DID NOT MAKE AMENDS FOR THIS
THOUGHTLESSNESS IN HIS SISTER. SHE WAS ALMOST AS FAR FROM BELIEVING AS
FROM WISHING IT TO BE SINCERE; FOR SHE HAD NOT FORGOTTEN THAT HE
COULD MISTAKE, AND HIS ASSERTION OF THE OFFER AND OF HER ENCOURAGEMENT
CONVINCED HER THAT HIS MISTAKES COULD SOMETIMES BE VERY EGREGIOUS.
IN VANITY, THEREFORE, SHE GAINED BUT LITTLE; HER CHIEF PROFIT WAS IN
WONDER. THAT HE SHOULD THINK IT WORTH HIS WHILE TO FANCY HIMSELF IN LOVE
WITH HER WAS A MATTER OF LIVELY ASTONISHMENT. ISABELLA TALKED OF HIS
ATTENTIONS; SHE HAD NEVER BEEN SENSIBLE OF ANY; BUT ISABELLA HAD SAID
MANY THINGS WHICH SHE HOPED HAD BEEN SPOKEN IN HASTE, AND WOULD NEVER
BE SAID AGAIN; AND UPON THIS SHE WAS GLAD TO REST ALTOGETHER FOR PRESENT
EASE AND COMFORT.




CHAPTER 19


A FEW DAYS PASSED AWAY, AND CATHERINE, THOUGH NOT ALLOWING HERSELF TO
SUSPECT HER FRIEND, COULD NOT HELP WATCHING HER CLOSELY. THE RESULT OF
HER OBSERVATIONS WAS NOT AGREEABLE. ISABELLA SEEMED AN ALTERED CREATURE.
WHEN SHE SAW HER, INDEED, SURROUNDED ONLY BY THEIR IMMEDIATE FRIENDS
IN EDGAR'S BUILDINGS OR PULTENEY STREET, HER CHANGE OF MANNERS WAS SO
TRIFLING THAT, HAD IT GONE NO FARTHER, IT MIGHT HAVE PASSED UNNOTICED.
A SOMETHING OF LANGUID INDIFFERENCE, OR OF THAT BOASTED ABSENCE OF
MIND WHICH CATHERINE HAD NEVER HEARD OF BEFORE, WOULD OCCASIONALLY COME
ACROSS HER; BUT HAD NOTHING WORSE APPEARED, THAT MIGHT ONLY HAVE SPREAD
A NEW GRACE AND INSPIRED A WARMER INTEREST. BUT WHEN CATHERINE SAW HER
IN PUBLIC, ADMITTING CAPTAIN TILNEY'S ATTENTIONS AS READILY AS THEY WERE
OFFERED, AND ALLOWING HIM ALMOST AN EQUAL SHARE WITH JAMES IN HER NOTICE
AND SMILES, THE ALTERATION BECAME TOO POSITIVE TO BE PASSED OVER. WHAT
COULD BE MEANT BY SUCH UNSTEADY CONDUCT, WHAT HER FRIEND COULD BE AT,
WAS BEYOND HER COMPREHENSION. ISABELLA COULD NOT BE AWARE OF THE PAIN
SHE WAS INFLICTING; BUT IT WAS A DEGREE OF WILFUL THOUGHTLESSNESS WHICH
CATHERINE COULD NOT BUT RESENT. JAMES WAS THE SUFFERER. SHE SAW HIM
GRAVE AND UNEASY; AND HOWEVER CARELESS OF HIS PRESENT COMFORT THE WOMAN
MIGHT BE WHO HAD GIVEN HIM HER HEART, TO HER IT WAS ALWAYS AN OBJECT.
FOR POOR CAPTAIN TILNEY TOO SHE WAS GREATLY CONCERNED. THOUGH HIS LOOKS
DID NOT PLEASE HER, HIS NAME WAS A PASSPORT TO HER GOODWILL, AND SHE
THOUGHT WITH SINCERE COMPASSION OF HIS APPROACHING DISAPPOINTMENT; FOR,
IN SPITE OF WHAT SHE HAD BELIEVED HERSELF TO OVERHEAR IN THE PUMP-ROOM,
HIS BEHAVIOUR WAS SO INCOMPATIBLE WITH A KNOWLEDGE OF ISABELLA'S
ENGAGEMENT THAT SHE COULD NOT, UPON REFLECTION, IMAGINE HIM AWARE OF IT.
HE MIGHT BE JEALOUS OF HER BROTHER AS A RIVAL, BUT IF MORE HAD SEEMED
IMPLIED, THE FAULT MUST HAVE BEEN IN HER MISAPPREHENSION. SHE WISHED, BY
A GENTLE REMONSTRANCE, TO REMIND ISABELLA OF HER SITUATION, AND MAKE
HER AWARE OF THIS DOUBLE UNKINDNESS; BUT FOR REMONSTRANCE, EITHER
OPPORTUNITY OR COMPREHENSION WAS ALWAYS AGAINST HER. IF ABLE TO SUGGEST
A HINT, ISABELLA COULD NEVER UNDERSTAND IT. IN THIS DISTRESS, THE
INTENDED DEPARTURE OF THE TILNEY FAMILY BECAME HER CHIEF CONSOLATION;
THEIR JOURNEY INTO GLOUCESTERSHIRE WAS TO TAKE PLACE WITHIN A FEW DAYS,
AND CAPTAIN TILNEY'S REMOVAL WOULD AT LEAST RESTORE PEACE TO EVERY HEART
BUT HIS OWN. BUT CAPTAIN TILNEY HAD AT PRESENT NO INTENTION OF REMOVING;
HE WAS NOT TO BE OF THE PARTY TO NORTHANGER; HE WAS TO CONTINUE AT BATH.
WHEN CATHERINE KNEW THIS, HER RESOLUTION WAS DIRECTLY MADE. SHE SPOKE TO
HENRY TILNEY ON THE SUBJECT, REGRETTING HIS BROTHER'S EVIDENT PARTIALITY
FOR MISS THORPE, AND ENTREATING HIM TO MAKE KNOWN HER PRIOR ENGAGEMENT.

"MY BROTHER DOES KNOW IT," WAS HENRY'S ANSWER.

"DOES HE? THEN WHY DOES HE STAY HERE?"

HE MADE NO REPLY, AND WAS BEGINNING TO TALK OF SOMETHING ELSE; BUT SHE
EAGERLY CONTINUED, "WHY DO NOT YOU PERSUADE HIM TO GO AWAY? THE LONGER
HE STAYS, THE WORSE IT WILL BE FOR HIM AT LAST. PRAY ADVISE HIM FOR HIS
OWN SAKE, AND FOR EVERYBODY'S SAKE, TO LEAVE BATH DIRECTLY. ABSENCE WILL
IN TIME MAKE HIM COMFORTABLE AGAIN; BUT HE CAN HAVE NO HOPE HERE, AND IT
IS ONLY STAYING TO BE MISERABLE."

HENRY SMILED AND SAID, "I AM SURE MY BROTHER WOULD NOT WISH TO DO THAT."

"THEN YOU WILL PERSUADE HIM TO GO AWAY?"

"PERSUASION IS NOT AT COMMAND; BUT PARDON ME, IF I CANNOT EVEN ENDEAVOUR
TO PERSUADE HIM. I HAVE MYSELF TOLD HIM THAT MISS THORPE IS ENGAGED. HE
KNOWS WHAT HE IS ABOUT, AND MUST BE HIS OWN MASTER."

"NO, HE DOES NOT KNOW WHAT HE IS ABOUT," CRIED CATHERINE; "HE DOES NOT
KNOW THE PAIN HE IS GIVING MY BROTHER. NOT THAT JAMES HAS EVER TOLD ME
SO, BUT I AM SURE HE IS VERY UNCOMFORTABLE."

"AND ARE YOU SURE IT IS MY BROTHER'S DOING?"

"YES, VERY SURE."

"IS IT MY BROTHER'S ATTENTIONS TO MISS THORPE, OR MISS THORPE'S
ADMISSION OF THEM, THAT GIVES THE PAIN?"

"IS NOT IT THE SAME THING?"

"I THINK MR. MORLAND WOULD ACKNOWLEDGE A DIFFERENCE. NO MAN IS OFFENDED
BY ANOTHER MAN'S ADMIRATION OF THE WOMAN HE LOVES; IT IS THE WOMAN ONLY
WHO CAN MAKE IT A TORMENT."

CATHERINE BLUSHED FOR HER FRIEND, AND SAID, "ISABELLA IS WRONG. BUT I
AM SURE SHE CANNOT MEAN TO TORMENT, FOR SHE IS VERY MUCH ATTACHED TO MY
BROTHER. SHE HAS BEEN IN LOVE WITH HIM EVER SINCE THEY FIRST MET, AND
WHILE MY FATHER'S CONSENT WAS UNCERTAIN, SHE FRETTED HERSELF ALMOST INTO
A FEVER. YOU KNOW SHE MUST BE ATTACHED TO HIM."

"I UNDERSTAND: SHE IS IN LOVE WITH JAMES, AND FLIRTS WITH FREDERICK."

"OH! NO, NOT FLIRTS. A WOMAN IN LOVE WITH ONE MAN CANNOT FLIRT WITH
ANOTHER."

"IT IS PROBABLE THAT SHE WILL NEITHER LOVE SO WELL, NOR FLIRT SO
WELL, AS SHE MIGHT DO EITHER SINGLY. THE GENTLEMEN MUST EACH GIVE UP A
LITTLE."

AFTER A SHORT PAUSE, CATHERINE RESUMED WITH, "THEN YOU DO NOT BELIEVE
ISABELLA SO VERY MUCH ATTACHED TO MY BROTHER?"

"I CAN HAVE NO OPINION ON THAT SUBJECT."

"BUT WHAT CAN YOUR BROTHER MEAN? IF HE KNOWS HER ENGAGEMENT, WHAT CAN HE
MEAN BY HIS BEHAVIOUR?"

"YOU ARE A VERY CLOSE QUESTIONER."

"AM I? I ONLY ASK WHAT I WANT TO BE TOLD."

"BUT DO YOU ONLY ASK WHAT I CAN BE EXPECTED TO TELL?"

"YES, I THINK SO; FOR YOU MUST KNOW YOUR BROTHER'S HEART."

"MY BROTHER'S HEART, AS YOU TERM IT, ON THE PRESENT OCCASION, I ASSURE
YOU I CAN ONLY GUESS AT."

"WELL?"

"WELL! NAY, IF IT IS TO BE GUESSWORK, LET US ALL GUESS FOR OURSELVES. TO
BE GUIDED BY SECOND-HAND CONJECTURE IS PITIFUL. THE PREMISES ARE BEFORE
YOU. MY BROTHER IS A LIVELY AND PERHAPS SOMETIMES A THOUGHTLESS YOUNG
MAN; HE HAS HAD ABOUT A WEEK'S ACQUAINTANCE WITH YOUR FRIEND, AND HE HAS
KNOWN HER ENGAGEMENT ALMOST AS LONG AS HE HAS KNOWN HER."

"WELL," SAID CATHERINE, AFTER SOME MOMENTS' CONSIDERATION, "YOU MAY BE
ABLE TO GUESS AT YOUR BROTHER'S INTENTIONS FROM ALL THIS; BUT I AM SURE
I CANNOT. BUT IS NOT YOUR FATHER UNCOMFORTABLE ABOUT IT? DOES NOT HE
WANT CAPTAIN TILNEY TO GO AWAY? SURE, IF YOUR FATHER WERE TO SPEAK TO
HIM, HE WOULD GO."

"MY DEAR MISS MORLAND," SAID HENRY, "IN THIS AMIABLE SOLICITUDE FOR YOUR
BROTHER'S COMFORT, MAY YOU NOT BE A LITTLE MISTAKEN? ARE YOU NOT CARRIED
A LITTLE TOO FAR? WOULD HE THANK YOU, EITHER ON HIS OWN ACCOUNT OR
MISS THORPE'S, FOR SUPPOSING THAT HER AFFECTION, OR AT LEAST HER GOOD
BEHAVIOUR, IS ONLY TO BE SECURED BY HER SEEING NOTHING OF CAPTAIN
TILNEY? IS HE SAFE ONLY IN SOLITUDE? OR IS HER HEART CONSTANT TO HIM
ONLY WHEN UNSOLICITED BY ANYONE ELSE? HE CANNOT THINK THIS--AND YOU MAY
BE SURE THAT HE WOULD NOT HAVE YOU THINK IT. I WILL NOT SAY, 'DO NOT
BE UNEASY,' BECAUSE I KNOW THAT YOU ARE SO, AT THIS MOMENT; BUT BE AS
LITTLE UNEASY AS YOU CAN. YOU HAVE NO DOUBT OF THE MUTUAL ATTACHMENT
OF YOUR BROTHER AND YOUR FRIEND; DEPEND UPON IT, THEREFORE, THAT
REAL JEALOUSY NEVER CAN EXIST BETWEEN THEM; DEPEND UPON IT THAT NO
DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN THEM CAN BE OF ANY DURATION. THEIR HEARTS ARE OPEN
TO EACH OTHER, AS NEITHER HEART CAN BE TO YOU; THEY KNOW EXACTLY WHAT
IS REQUIRED AND WHAT CAN BE BORNE; AND YOU MAY BE CERTAIN THAT ONE WILL
NEVER TEASE THE OTHER BEYOND WHAT IS KNOWN TO BE PLEASANT."

PERCEIVING HER STILL TO LOOK DOUBTFUL AND GRAVE, HE ADDED, "THOUGH
FREDERICK DOES NOT LEAVE BATH WITH US, HE WILL PROBABLY REMAIN BUT A
VERY SHORT TIME, PERHAPS ONLY A FEW DAYS BEHIND US. HIS LEAVE OF ABSENCE
WILL SOON EXPIRE, AND HE MUST RETURN TO HIS REGIMENT. AND WHAT WILL THEN
BE THEIR ACQUAINTANCE? THE MESS-ROOM WILL DRINK ISABELLA THORPE FOR
A FORTNIGHT, AND SHE WILL LAUGH WITH YOUR BROTHER OVER POOR TILNEY'S
PASSION FOR A MONTH."

CATHERINE WOULD CONTEND NO LONGER AGAINST COMFORT. SHE HAD RESISTED ITS
APPROACHES DURING THE WHOLE LENGTH OF A SPEECH, BUT IT NOW CARRIED HER
CAPTIVE. HENRY TILNEY MUST KNOW BEST. SHE BLAMED HERSELF FOR THE EXTENT
OF HER FEARS, AND RESOLVED NEVER TO THINK SO SERIOUSLY ON THE SUBJECT
AGAIN.

HER RESOLUTION WAS SUPPORTED BY ISABELLA'S BEHAVIOUR IN THEIR PARTING
INTERVIEW. THE THORPES SPENT THE LAST EVENING OF CATHERINE'S STAY IN
PULTENEY STREET, AND NOTHING PASSED BETWEEN THE LOVERS TO EXCITE
HER UNEASINESS, OR MAKE HER QUIT THEM IN APPREHENSION. JAMES WAS IN
EXCELLENT SPIRITS, AND ISABELLA MOST ENGAGINGLY PLACID. HER TENDERNESS
FOR HER FRIEND SEEMED RATHER THE FIRST FEELING OF HER HEART; BUT THAT
AT SUCH A MOMENT WAS ALLOWABLE; AND ONCE SHE GAVE HER LOVER A FLAT
CONTRADICTION, AND ONCE SHE DREW BACK HER HAND; BUT CATHERINE REMEMBERED
HENRY'S INSTRUCTIONS, AND PLACED IT ALL TO JUDICIOUS AFFECTION. THE
EMBRACES, TEARS, AND PROMISES OF THE PARTING FAIR ONES MAY BE FANCIED.




CHAPTER 20


MR. AND MRS. ALLEN WERE SORRY TO LOSE THEIR YOUNG FRIEND, WHOSE GOOD
HUMOUR AND CHEERFULNESS HAD MADE HER A VALUABLE COMPANION, AND IN THE
PROMOTION OF WHOSE ENJOYMENT THEIR OWN HAD BEEN GENTLY INCREASED. HER
HAPPINESS IN GOING WITH MISS TILNEY, HOWEVER, PREVENTED THEIR WISHING
IT OTHERWISE; AND, AS THEY WERE TO REMAIN ONLY ONE MORE WEEK IN BATH
THEMSELVES, HER QUITTING THEM NOW WOULD NOT LONG BE FELT. MR. ALLEN
ATTENDED HER TO MILSOM STREET, WHERE SHE WAS TO BREAKFAST, AND SAW HER
SEATED WITH THE KINDEST WELCOME AMONG HER NEW FRIENDS; BUT SO GREAT WAS
HER AGITATION IN FINDING HERSELF AS ONE OF THE FAMILY, AND SO FEARFUL
WAS SHE OF NOT DOING EXACTLY WHAT WAS RIGHT, AND OF NOT BEING ABLE TO
PRESERVE THEIR GOOD OPINION, THAT, IN THE EMBARRASSMENT OF THE FIRST
FIVE MINUTES, SHE COULD ALMOST HAVE WISHED TO RETURN WITH HIM TO
PULTENEY STREET.

MISS TILNEY'S MANNERS AND HENRY'S SMILE SOON DID AWAY SOME OF HER
UNPLEASANT FEELINGS; BUT STILL SHE WAS FAR FROM BEING AT EASE; NOR COULD
THE INCESSANT ATTENTIONS OF THE GENERAL HIMSELF ENTIRELY REASSURE HER.
NAY, PERVERSE AS IT SEEMED, SHE DOUBTED WHETHER SHE MIGHT NOT HAVE FELT
LESS, HAD SHE BEEN LESS ATTENDED TO. HIS ANXIETY FOR HER COMFORT--HIS
CONTINUAL SOLICITATIONS THAT SHE WOULD EAT, AND HIS OFTEN-EXPRESSED
FEARS OF HER SEEING NOTHING TO HER TASTE--THOUGH NEVER IN HER LIFE
BEFORE HAD SHE BEHELD HALF SUCH VARIETY ON A BREAKFAST-TABLE--MADE IT
IMPOSSIBLE FOR HER TO FORGET FOR A MOMENT THAT SHE WAS A VISITOR. SHE
FELT UTTERLY UNWORTHY OF SUCH RESPECT, AND KNEW NOT HOW TO REPLY TO IT.
HER TRANQUILLITY WAS NOT IMPROVED BY THE GENERAL'S IMPATIENCE FOR THE
APPEARANCE OF HIS ELDEST SON, NOR BY THE DISPLEASURE HE EXPRESSED AT HIS
LAZINESS WHEN CAPTAIN TILNEY AT LAST CAME DOWN. SHE WAS QUITE PAINED BY
THE SEVERITY OF HIS FATHER'S REPROOF, WHICH SEEMED DISPROPORTIONATE TO
THE OFFENCE; AND MUCH WAS HER CONCERN INCREASED WHEN SHE FOUND HERSELF
THE PRINCIPAL CAUSE OF THE LECTURE, AND THAT HIS TARDINESS WAS CHIEFLY
RESENTED FROM BEING DISRESPECTFUL TO HER. THIS WAS PLACING HER IN A
VERY UNCOMFORTABLE SITUATION, AND SHE FELT GREAT COMPASSION FOR CAPTAIN
TILNEY, WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO HOPE FOR HIS GOODWILL.

HE LISTENED TO HIS FATHER IN SILENCE, AND ATTEMPTED NOT ANY DEFENCE,
WHICH CONFIRMED HER IN FEARING THAT THE INQUIETUDE OF HIS MIND, ON
ISABELLA'S ACCOUNT, MIGHT, BY KEEPING HIM LONG SLEEPLESS, HAVE BEEN
THE REAL CAUSE OF HIS RISING LATE. IT WAS THE FIRST TIME OF HER BEING
DECIDEDLY IN HIS COMPANY, AND SHE HAD HOPED TO BE NOW ABLE TO FORM
HER OPINION OF HIM; BUT SHE SCARCELY HEARD HIS VOICE WHILE HIS FATHER
REMAINED IN THE ROOM; AND EVEN AFTERWARDS, SO MUCH WERE HIS SPIRITS
AFFECTED, SHE COULD DISTINGUISH NOTHING BUT THESE WORDS, IN A WHISPER TO
ELEANOR, "HOW GLAD I SHALL BE WHEN YOU ARE ALL OFF."

THE BUSTLE OF GOING WAS NOT PLEASANT. THE CLOCK STRUCK TEN WHILE THE
TRUNKS WERE CARRYING DOWN, AND THE GENERAL HAD FIXED TO BE OUT OF MILSOM
STREET BY THAT HOUR. HIS GREATCOAT, INSTEAD OF BEING BROUGHT FOR HIM
TO PUT ON DIRECTLY, WAS SPREAD OUT IN THE CURRICLE IN WHICH HE WAS TO
ACCOMPANY HIS SON. THE MIDDLE SEAT OF THE CHAISE WAS NOT DRAWN OUT,
THOUGH THERE WERE THREE PEOPLE TO GO IN IT, AND HIS DAUGHTER'S MAID HAD
SO CROWDED IT WITH PARCELS THAT MISS MORLAND WOULD NOT HAVE ROOM TO SIT;
AND, SO MUCH WAS HE INFLUENCED BY THIS APPREHENSION WHEN HE HANDED HER
IN, THAT SHE HAD SOME DIFFICULTY IN SAVING HER OWN NEW WRITING-DESK FROM
BEING THROWN OUT INTO THE STREET. AT LAST, HOWEVER, THE DOOR WAS CLOSED
UPON THE THREE FEMALES, AND THEY SET OFF AT THE SOBER PACE IN WHICH
THE HANDSOME, HIGHLY FED FOUR HORSES OF A GENTLEMAN USUALLY PERFORM A
JOURNEY OF THIRTY MILES: SUCH WAS THE DISTANCE OF NORTHANGER FROM BATH,
TO BE NOW DIVIDED INTO TWO EQUAL STAGES. CATHERINE'S SPIRITS REVIVED AS
THEY DROVE FROM THE DOOR; FOR WITH MISS TILNEY SHE FELT NO RESTRAINT;
AND, WITH THE INTEREST OF A ROAD ENTIRELY NEW TO HER, OF AN ABBEY
BEFORE, AND A CURRICLE BEHIND, SHE CAUGHT THE LAST VIEW OF BATH WITHOUT
ANY REGRET, AND MET WITH EVERY MILESTONE BEFORE SHE EXPECTED IT. THE
TEDIOUSNESS OF A TWO HOURS' WAIT AT PETTY FRANCE, IN WHICH THERE WAS
NOTHING TO BE DONE BUT TO EAT WITHOUT BEING HUNGRY, AND LOITER ABOUT
WITHOUT ANYTHING TO SEE, NEXT FOLLOWED--AND HER ADMIRATION OF THE STYLE
IN WHICH THEY TRAVELLED, OF THE FASHIONABLE CHAISE AND FOUR--POSTILIONS
HANDSOMELY LIVERIED, RISING SO REGULARLY IN THEIR STIRRUPS, AND
NUMEROUS OUTRIDERS PROPERLY MOUNTED, SUNK A LITTLE UNDER THIS CONSEQUENT
INCONVENIENCE. HAD THEIR PARTY BEEN PERFECTLY AGREEABLE, THE DELAY WOULD
HAVE BEEN NOTHING; BUT GENERAL TILNEY, THOUGH SO CHARMING A MAN, SEEMED
ALWAYS A CHECK UPON HIS CHILDREN'S SPIRITS, AND SCARCELY ANYTHING WAS
SAID BUT BY HIMSELF; THE OBSERVATION OF WHICH, WITH HIS DISCONTENT AT
WHATEVER THE INN AFFORDED, AND HIS ANGRY IMPATIENCE AT THE WAITERS, MADE
CATHERINE GROW EVERY MOMENT MORE IN AWE OF HIM, AND APPEARED TO LENGTHEN
THE TWO HOURS INTO FOUR. AT LAST, HOWEVER, THE ORDER OF RELEASE WAS
GIVEN; AND MUCH WAS CATHERINE THEN SURPRISED BY THE GENERAL'S PROPOSAL
OF HER TAKING HIS PLACE IN HIS SON'S CURRICLE FOR THE REST OF THE
JOURNEY: "THE DAY WAS FINE, AND HE WAS ANXIOUS FOR HER SEEING AS MUCH OF
THE COUNTRY AS POSSIBLE."

THE REMEMBRANCE OF MR. ALLEN'S OPINION, RESPECTING YOUNG MEN'S OPEN
CARRIAGES, MADE HER BLUSH AT THE MENTION OF SUCH A PLAN, AND HER FIRST
THOUGHT WAS TO DECLINE IT; BUT HER SECOND WAS OF GREATER DEFERENCE FOR
GENERAL TILNEY'S JUDGMENT; HE COULD NOT PROPOSE ANYTHING IMPROPER FOR
HER; AND, IN THE COURSE OF A FEW MINUTES, SHE FOUND HERSELF WITH HENRY
IN THE CURRICLE, AS HAPPY A BEING AS EVER EXISTED. A VERY SHORT TRIAL
CONVINCED HER THAT A CURRICLE WAS THE PRETTIEST EQUIPAGE IN THE WORLD;
THE CHAISE AND FOUR WHEELED OFF WITH SOME GRANDEUR, TO BE SURE, BUT IT
WAS A HEAVY AND TROUBLESOME BUSINESS, AND SHE COULD NOT EASILY FORGET
ITS HAVING STOPPED TWO HOURS AT PETTY FRANCE. HALF THE TIME WOULD
HAVE BEEN ENOUGH FOR THE CURRICLE, AND SO NIMBLY WERE THE LIGHT HORSES
DISPOSED TO MOVE, THAT, HAD NOT THE GENERAL CHOSEN TO HAVE HIS OWN
CARRIAGE LEAD THE WAY, THEY COULD HAVE PASSED IT WITH EASE IN HALF A
MINUTE. BUT THE MERIT OF THE CURRICLE DID NOT ALL BELONG TO THE HORSES;
HENRY DROVE SO WELL--SO QUIETLY--WITHOUT MAKING ANY DISTURBANCE,
WITHOUT PARADING TO HER, OR SWEARING AT THEM: SO DIFFERENT FROM THE ONLY
GENTLEMAN-COACHMAN WHOM IT WAS IN HER POWER TO COMPARE HIM WITH! AND
THEN HIS HAT SAT SO WELL, AND THE INNUMERABLE CAPES OF HIS GREATCOAT
LOOKED SO BECOMINGLY IMPORTANT! TO BE DRIVEN BY HIM, NEXT TO BEING
DANCING WITH HIM, WAS CERTAINLY THE GREATEST HAPPINESS IN THE WORLD. IN
ADDITION TO EVERY OTHER DELIGHT, SHE HAD NOW THAT OF LISTENING TO HER
OWN PRAISE; OF BEING THANKED AT LEAST, ON HIS SISTER'S ACCOUNT, FOR
HER KINDNESS IN THUS BECOMING HER VISITOR; OF HEARING IT RANKED AS REAL
FRIENDSHIP, AND DESCRIBED AS CREATING REAL GRATITUDE. HIS SISTER, HE
SAID, WAS UNCOMFORTABLY CIRCUMSTANCED--SHE HAD NO FEMALE COMPANION--AND,
IN THE FREQUENT ABSENCE OF HER FATHER, WAS SOMETIMES WITHOUT ANY
COMPANION AT ALL.

"BUT HOW CAN THAT BE?" SAID CATHERINE. "ARE NOT YOU WITH HER?"

"NORTHANGER IS NOT MORE THAN HALF MY HOME; I HAVE AN ESTABLISHMENT AT
MY OWN HOUSE IN WOODSTON, WHICH IS NEARLY TWENTY MILES FROM MY FATHER'S,
AND SOME OF MY TIME IS NECESSARILY SPENT THERE."

"HOW SORRY YOU MUST BE FOR THAT!"

"I AM ALWAYS SORRY TO LEAVE ELEANOR."

"YES; BUT BESIDES YOUR AFFECTION FOR HER, YOU MUST BE SO FOND OF
THE ABBEY! AFTER BEING USED TO SUCH A HOME AS THE ABBEY, AN ORDINARY
PARSONAGE-HOUSE MUST BE VERY DISAGREEABLE."

HE SMILED, AND SAID, "YOU HAVE FORMED A VERY FAVOURABLE IDEA OF THE
ABBEY."

"TO BE SURE, I HAVE. IS NOT IT A FINE OLD PLACE, JUST LIKE WHAT ONE
READS ABOUT?"

"AND ARE YOU PREPARED TO ENCOUNTER ALL THE HORRORS THAT A BUILDING SUCH
AS 'WHAT ONE READS ABOUT' MAY PRODUCE? HAVE YOU A STOUT HEART? NERVES
FIT FOR SLIDING PANELS AND TAPESTRY?"

"OH! YES--I DO NOT THINK I SHOULD BE EASILY FRIGHTENED, BECAUSE THERE
WOULD BE SO MANY PEOPLE IN THE HOUSE--AND BESIDES, IT HAS NEVER BEEN
UNINHABITED AND LEFT DESERTED FOR YEARS, AND THEN THE FAMILY COME BACK
TO IT UNAWARES, WITHOUT GIVING ANY NOTICE, AS GENERALLY HAPPENS."

"NO, CERTAINLY. WE SHALL NOT HAVE TO EXPLORE OUR WAY INTO A HALL DIMLY
LIGHTED BY THE EXPIRING EMBERS OF A WOOD FIRE--NOR BE OBLIGED TO SPREAD
OUR BEDS ON THE FLOOR OF A ROOM WITHOUT WINDOWS, DOORS, OR FURNITURE.
BUT YOU MUST BE AWARE THAT WHEN A YOUNG LADY IS (BY WHATEVER MEANS)
INTRODUCED INTO A DWELLING OF THIS KIND, SHE IS ALWAYS LODGED APART FROM
THE REST OF THE FAMILY. WHILE THEY SNUGLY REPAIR TO THEIR OWN END OF THE
HOUSE, SHE IS FORMALLY CONDUCTED BY DOROTHY, THE ANCIENT HOUSEKEEPER, UP
A DIFFERENT STAIRCASE, AND ALONG MANY GLOOMY PASSAGES, INTO AN APARTMENT
NEVER USED SINCE SOME COUSIN OR KIN DIED IN IT ABOUT TWENTY YEARS
BEFORE. CAN YOU STAND SUCH A CEREMONY AS THIS? WILL NOT YOUR MIND
MISGIVE YOU WHEN YOU FIND YOURSELF IN THIS GLOOMY CHAMBER--TOO LOFTY AND
EXTENSIVE FOR YOU, WITH ONLY THE FEEBLE RAYS OF A SINGLE LAMP TO TAKE
IN ITS SIZE--ITS WALLS HUNG WITH TAPESTRY EXHIBITING FIGURES AS LARGE AS
LIFE, AND THE BED, OF DARK GREEN STUFF OR PURPLE VELVET, PRESENTING EVEN
A FUNEREAL APPEARANCE? WILL NOT YOUR HEART SINK WITHIN YOU?"

"OH! BUT THIS WILL NOT HAPPEN TO ME, I AM SURE."

"HOW FEARFULLY WILL YOU EXAMINE THE FURNITURE OF YOUR APARTMENT! AND
WHAT WILL YOU DISCERN? NOT TABLES, TOILETTES, WARDROBES, OR DRAWERS,
BUT ON ONE SIDE PERHAPS THE REMAINS OF A BROKEN LUTE, ON THE OTHER A
PONDEROUS CHEST WHICH NO EFFORTS CAN OPEN, AND OVER THE FIREPLACE
THE PORTRAIT OF SOME HANDSOME WARRIOR, WHOSE FEATURES WILL SO
INCOMPREHENSIBLY STRIKE YOU, THAT YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO WITHDRAW YOUR
EYES FROM IT. DOROTHY, MEANWHILE, NO LESS STRUCK BY YOUR APPEARANCE,
GAZES ON YOU IN GREAT AGITATION, AND DROPS A FEW UNINTELLIGIBLE HINTS.
TO RAISE YOUR SPIRITS, MOREOVER, SHE GIVES YOU REASON TO SUPPOSE THAT
THE PART OF THE ABBEY YOU INHABIT IS UNDOUBTEDLY HAUNTED, AND INFORMS
YOU THAT YOU WILL NOT HAVE A SINGLE DOMESTIC WITHIN CALL. WITH THIS
PARTING CORDIAL SHE CURTSIES OFF--YOU LISTEN TO THE SOUND OF HER
RECEDING FOOTSTEPS AS LONG AS THE LAST ECHO CAN REACH YOU--AND WHEN,
WITH FAINTING SPIRITS, YOU ATTEMPT TO FASTEN YOUR DOOR, YOU DISCOVER,
WITH INCREASED ALARM, THAT IT HAS NO LOCK."

"OH! MR. TILNEY, HOW FRIGHTFUL! THIS IS JUST LIKE A BOOK! BUT IT CANNOT
REALLY HAPPEN TO ME. I AM SURE YOUR HOUSEKEEPER IS NOT REALLY DOROTHY.
WELL, WHAT THEN?"

"NOTHING FURTHER TO ALARM PERHAPS MAY OCCUR THE FIRST NIGHT. AFTER
SURMOUNTING YOUR UNCONQUERABLE HORROR OF THE BED, YOU WILL RETIRE TO
REST, AND GET A FEW HOURS' UNQUIET SLUMBER. BUT ON THE SECOND, OR AT
FARTHEST THE THIRD NIGHT AFTER YOUR ARRIVAL, YOU WILL PROBABLY HAVE A
VIOLENT STORM. PEALS OF THUNDER SO LOUD AS TO SEEM TO SHAKE THE EDIFICE
TO ITS FOUNDATION WILL ROLL ROUND THE NEIGHBOURING MOUNTAINS--AND DURING
THE FRIGHTFUL GUSTS OF WIND WHICH ACCOMPANY IT, YOU WILL PROBABLY THINK
YOU DISCERN (FOR YOUR LAMP IS NOT EXTINGUISHED) ONE PART OF THE HANGING
MORE VIOLENTLY AGITATED THAN THE REST. UNABLE OF COURSE TO REPRESS YOUR
CURIOSITY IN SO FAVOURABLE A MOMENT FOR INDULGING IT, YOU WILL INSTANTLY
ARISE, AND THROWING YOUR DRESSING-GOWN AROUND YOU, PROCEED TO EXAMINE
THIS MYSTERY. AFTER A VERY SHORT SEARCH, YOU WILL DISCOVER A DIVISION IN
THE TAPESTRY SO ARTFULLY CONSTRUCTED AS TO DEFY THE MINUTEST INSPECTION,
AND ON OPENING IT, A DOOR WILL IMMEDIATELY APPEAR--WHICH DOOR, BEING
ONLY SECURED BY MASSY BARS AND A PADLOCK, YOU WILL, AFTER A FEW EFFORTS,
SUCCEED IN OPENING--AND, WITH YOUR LAMP IN YOUR HAND, WILL PASS THROUGH
IT INTO A SMALL VAULTED ROOM."

"NO, INDEED; I SHOULD BE TOO MUCH FRIGHTENED TO DO ANY SUCH THING."

"WHAT! NOT WHEN DOROTHY HAS GIVEN YOU TO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS A
SECRET SUBTERRANEOUS COMMUNICATION BETWEEN YOUR APARTMENT AND THE CHAPEL
OF ST. ANTHONY, SCARCELY TWO MILES OFF? COULD YOU SHRINK FROM SO SIMPLE
AN ADVENTURE? NO, NO, YOU WILL PROCEED INTO THIS SMALL VAULTED ROOM,
AND THROUGH THIS INTO SEVERAL OTHERS, WITHOUT PERCEIVING ANYTHING VERY
REMARKABLE IN EITHER. IN ONE PERHAPS THERE MAY BE A DAGGER, IN ANOTHER
A FEW DROPS OF BLOOD, AND IN A THIRD THE REMAINS OF SOME INSTRUMENT OF
TORTURE; BUT THERE BEING NOTHING IN ALL THIS OUT OF THE COMMON WAY,
AND YOUR LAMP BEING NEARLY EXHAUSTED, YOU WILL RETURN TOWARDS YOUR OWN
APARTMENT. IN REPASSING THROUGH THE SMALL VAULTED ROOM, HOWEVER, YOUR
EYES WILL BE ATTRACTED TOWARDS A LARGE, OLD-FASHIONED CABINET OF EBONY
AND GOLD, WHICH, THOUGH NARROWLY EXAMINING THE FURNITURE BEFORE, YOU
HAD PASSED UNNOTICED. IMPELLED BY AN IRRESISTIBLE PRESENTIMENT, YOU WILL
EAGERLY ADVANCE TO IT, UNLOCK ITS FOLDING DOORS, AND SEARCH INTO
EVERY DRAWER--BUT FOR SOME TIME WITHOUT DISCOVERING ANYTHING OF
IMPORTANCE--PERHAPS NOTHING BUT A CONSIDERABLE HOARD OF DIAMONDS. AT
LAST, HOWEVER, BY TOUCHING A SECRET SPRING, AN INNER COMPARTMENT WILL
OPEN--A ROLL OF PAPER APPEARS--YOU SEIZE IT--IT CONTAINS MANY SHEETS OF
MANUSCRIPT--YOU HASTEN WITH THE PRECIOUS TREASURE INTO YOUR OWN CHAMBER,
BUT SCARCELY HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE TO DECIPHER 'OH! THOU--WHOMSOEVER THOU
MAYST BE, INTO WHOSE HANDS THESE MEMOIRS OF THE WRETCHED MATILDA MAY
FALL'--WHEN YOUR LAMP SUDDENLY EXPIRES IN THE SOCKET, AND LEAVES YOU IN
TOTAL DARKNESS."

"OH! NO, NO--DO NOT SAY SO. WELL, GO ON."

BUT HENRY WAS TOO MUCH AMUSED BY THE INTEREST HE HAD RAISED TO BE ABLE
TO CARRY IT FARTHER; HE COULD NO LONGER COMMAND SOLEMNITY EITHER OF
SUBJECT OR VOICE, AND WAS OBLIGED TO ENTREAT HER TO USE HER OWN FANCY
IN THE PERUSAL OF MATILDA'S WOES. CATHERINE, RECOLLECTING HERSELF, GREW
ASHAMED OF HER EAGERNESS, AND BEGAN EARNESTLY TO ASSURE HIM THAT HER
ATTENTION HAD BEEN FIXED WITHOUT THE SMALLEST APPREHENSION OF REALLY
MEETING WITH WHAT HE RELATED. "MISS TILNEY, SHE WAS SURE, WOULD NEVER
PUT HER INTO SUCH A CHAMBER AS HE HAD DESCRIBED! SHE WAS NOT AT ALL
AFRAID."

AS THEY DREW NEAR THE END OF THEIR JOURNEY, HER IMPATIENCE FOR A SIGHT
OF THE ABBEY--FOR SOME TIME SUSPENDED BY HIS CONVERSATION ON SUBJECTS
VERY DIFFERENT--RETURNED IN FULL FORCE, AND EVERY BEND IN THE ROAD WAS
EXPECTED WITH SOLEMN AWE TO AFFORD A GLIMPSE OF ITS MASSY WALLS OF GREY
STONE, RISING AMIDST A GROVE OF ANCIENT OAKS, WITH THE LAST BEAMS OF THE
SUN PLAYING IN BEAUTIFUL SPLENDOUR ON ITS HIGH GOTHIC WINDOWS. BUT SO
LOW DID THE BUILDING STAND, THAT SHE FOUND HERSELF PASSING THROUGH THE
GREAT GATES OF THE LODGE INTO THE VERY GROUNDS OF NORTHANGER, WITHOUT
HAVING DISCERNED EVEN AN ANTIQUE CHIMNEY.

SHE KNEW NOT THAT SHE HAD ANY RIGHT TO BE SURPRISED, BUT THERE WAS A
SOMETHING IN THIS MODE OF APPROACH WHICH SHE CERTAINLY HAD NOT EXPECTED.
TO PASS BETWEEN LODGES OF A MODERN APPEARANCE, TO FIND HERSELF WITH SUCH
EASE IN THE VERY PRECINCTS OF THE ABBEY, AND DRIVEN SO RAPIDLY ALONG A
SMOOTH, LEVEL ROAD OF FINE GRAVEL, WITHOUT OBSTACLE, ALARM, OR SOLEMNITY
OF ANY KIND, STRUCK HER AS ODD AND INCONSISTENT. SHE WAS NOT LONG
AT LEISURE, HOWEVER, FOR SUCH CONSIDERATIONS. A SUDDEN SCUD OF RAIN,
DRIVING FULL IN HER FACE, MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR HER TO OBSERVE ANYTHING
FURTHER, AND FIXED ALL HER THOUGHTS ON THE WELFARE OF HER NEW STRAW
BONNET; AND SHE WAS ACTUALLY UNDER THE ABBEY WALLS, WAS SPRINGING, WITH
HENRY'S ASSISTANCE, FROM THE CARRIAGE, WAS BENEATH THE SHELTER OF THE
OLD PORCH, AND HAD EVEN PASSED ON TO THE HALL, WHERE HER FRIEND AND
THE GENERAL WERE WAITING TO WELCOME HER, WITHOUT FEELING ONE AWFUL
FOREBODING OF FUTURE MISERY TO HERSELF, OR ONE MOMENT'S SUSPICION OF ANY
PAST SCENES OF HORROR BEING ACTED WITHIN THE SOLEMN EDIFICE. THE BREEZE
HAD NOT SEEMED TO WAFT THE SIGHS OF THE MURDERED TO HER; IT HAD WAFTED
NOTHING WORSE THAN A THICK MIZZLING RAIN; AND HAVING GIVEN A GOOD SHAKE
TO HER HABIT, SHE WAS READY TO BE SHOWN INTO THE COMMON DRAWING-ROOM,
AND CAPABLE OF CONSIDERING WHERE SHE WAS.

AN ABBEY! YES, IT WAS DELIGHTFUL TO BE REALLY IN AN ABBEY! BUT SHE
DOUBTED, AS SHE LOOKED ROUND THE ROOM, WHETHER ANYTHING WITHIN HER
OBSERVATION WOULD HAVE GIVEN HER THE CONSCIOUSNESS. THE FURNITURE WAS IN
ALL THE PROFUSION AND ELEGANCE OF MODERN TASTE. THE FIREPLACE, WHERE SHE
HAD EXPECTED THE AMPLE WIDTH AND PONDEROUS CARVING OF FORMER TIMES, WAS
CONTRACTED TO A RUMFORD, WITH SLABS OF PLAIN THOUGH HANDSOME MARBLE, AND
ORNAMENTS OVER IT OF THE PRETTIEST ENGLISH CHINA. THE WINDOWS, TO WHICH
SHE LOOKED WITH PECULIAR DEPENDENCE, FROM HAVING HEARD THE GENERAL TALK
OF HIS PRESERVING THEM IN THEIR GOTHIC FORM WITH REVERENTIAL CARE, WERE
YET LESS WHAT HER FANCY HAD PORTRAYED. TO BE SURE, THE POINTED ARCH
WAS PRESERVED--THE FORM OF THEM WAS GOTHIC--THEY MIGHT BE EVEN
CASEMENTS--BUT EVERY PANE WAS SO LARGE, SO CLEAR, SO LIGHT! TO AN
IMAGINATION WHICH HAD HOPED FOR THE SMALLEST DIVISIONS, AND THE HEAVIEST
STONE-WORK, FOR PAINTED GLASS, DIRT, AND COBWEBS, THE DIFFERENCE WAS
VERY DISTRESSING.

THE GENERAL, PERCEIVING HOW HER EYE WAS EMPLOYED, BEGAN TO TALK OF THE
SMALLNESS OF THE ROOM AND SIMPLICITY OF THE FURNITURE, WHERE EVERYTHING,
BEING FOR DAILY USE, PRETENDED ONLY TO COMFORT, ETC.; FLATTERING
HIMSELF, HOWEVER, THAT THERE WERE SOME APARTMENTS IN THE ABBEY NOT
UNWORTHY HER NOTICE--AND WAS PROCEEDING TO MENTION THE COSTLY GILDING
OF ONE IN PARTICULAR, WHEN, TAKING OUT HIS WATCH, HE STOPPED SHORT TO
PRONOUNCE IT WITH SURPRISE WITHIN TWENTY MINUTES OF FIVE! THIS SEEMED
THE WORD OF SEPARATION, AND CATHERINE FOUND HERSELF HURRIED AWAY BY MISS
TILNEY IN SUCH A MANNER AS CONVINCED HER THAT THE STRICTEST PUNCTUALITY
TO THE FAMILY HOURS WOULD BE EXPECTED AT NORTHANGER.

RETURNING THROUGH THE LARGE AND LOFTY HALL, THEY ASCENDED A BROAD
STAIRCASE OF SHINING OAK, WHICH, AFTER MANY FLIGHTS AND MANY
LANDING-PLACES, BROUGHT THEM UPON A LONG, WIDE GALLERY. ON ONE SIDE IT
HAD A RANGE OF DOORS, AND IT WAS LIGHTED ON THE OTHER BY WINDOWS WHICH
CATHERINE HAD ONLY TIME TO DISCOVER LOOKED INTO A QUADRANGLE, BEFORE
MISS TILNEY LED THE WAY INTO A CHAMBER, AND SCARCELY STAYING TO HOPE SHE
WOULD FIND IT COMFORTABLE, LEFT HER WITH AN ANXIOUS ENTREATY THAT SHE
WOULD MAKE AS LITTLE ALTERATION AS POSSIBLE IN HER DRESS.




CHAPTER 21


A MOMENT'S GLANCE WAS ENOUGH TO SATISFY CATHERINE THAT HER APARTMENT
WAS VERY UNLIKE THE ONE WHICH HENRY HAD ENDEAVOURED TO ALARM HER BY THE
DESCRIPTION OF. IT WAS BY NO MEANS UNREASONABLY LARGE, AND CONTAINED
NEITHER TAPESTRY NOR VELVET. THE WALLS WERE PAPERED, THE FLOOR WAS
CARPETED; THE WINDOWS WERE NEITHER LESS PERFECT NOR MORE DIM THAN THOSE
OF THE DRAWING-ROOM BELOW; THE FURNITURE, THOUGH NOT OF THE LATEST
FASHION, WAS HANDSOME AND COMFORTABLE, AND THE AIR OF THE ROOM
ALTOGETHER FAR FROM UNCHEERFUL. HER HEART INSTANTANEOUSLY AT EASE ON
THIS POINT, SHE RESOLVED TO LOSE NO TIME IN PARTICULAR EXAMINATION OF
ANYTHING, AS SHE GREATLY DREADED DISOBLIGING THE GENERAL BY ANY DELAY.
HER HABIT THEREFORE WAS THROWN OFF WITH ALL POSSIBLE HASTE, AND SHE WAS
PREPARING TO UNPIN THE LINEN PACKAGE, WHICH THE CHAISE-SEAT HAD CONVEYED
FOR HER IMMEDIATE ACCOMMODATION, WHEN HER EYE SUDDENLY FELL ON A LARGE
HIGH CHEST, STANDING BACK IN A DEEP RECESS ON ONE SIDE OF THE FIREPLACE.
THE SIGHT OF IT MADE HER START; AND, FORGETTING EVERYTHING ELSE, SHE
STOOD GAZING ON IT IN MOTIONLESS WONDER, WHILE THESE THOUGHTS CROSSED
HER:

"THIS IS STRANGE INDEED! I DID NOT EXPECT SUCH A SIGHT AS THIS! AN
IMMENSE HEAVY CHEST! WHAT CAN IT HOLD? WHY SHOULD IT BE PLACED HERE?
PUSHED BACK TOO, AS IF MEANT TO BE OUT OF SIGHT! I WILL LOOK INTO
IT--COST ME WHAT IT MAY, I WILL LOOK INTO IT--AND DIRECTLY TOO--BY
DAYLIGHT. IF I STAY TILL EVENING MY CANDLE MAY GO OUT." SHE ADVANCED AND
EXAMINED IT CLOSELY: IT WAS OF CEDAR, CURIOUSLY INLAID WITH SOME DARKER
WOOD, AND RAISED, ABOUT A FOOT FROM THE GROUND, ON A CARVED STAND OF THE
SAME. THE LOCK WAS SILVER, THOUGH TARNISHED FROM AGE; AT EACH END
WERE THE IMPERFECT REMAINS OF HANDLES ALSO OF SILVER, BROKEN PERHAPS
PREMATURELY BY SOME STRANGE VIOLENCE; AND, ON THE CENTRE OF THE LID, WAS
A MYSTERIOUS CIPHER, IN THE SAME METAL. CATHERINE BENT OVER IT INTENTLY,
BUT WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO DISTINGUISH ANYTHING WITH CERTAINTY. SHE COULD
NOT, IN WHATEVER DIRECTION SHE TOOK IT, BELIEVE THE LAST LETTER TO BE
A T; AND YET THAT IT SHOULD BE ANYTHING ELSE IN THAT HOUSE WAS
A CIRCUMSTANCE TO RAISE NO COMMON DEGREE OF ASTONISHMENT. IF NOT
ORIGINALLY THEIRS, BY WHAT STRANGE EVENTS COULD IT HAVE FALLEN INTO THE
TILNEY FAMILY?

HER FEARFUL CURIOSITY WAS EVERY MOMENT GROWING GREATER; AND SEIZING,
WITH TREMBLING HANDS, THE HASP OF THE LOCK, SHE RESOLVED AT ALL HAZARDS
TO SATISFY HERSELF AT LEAST AS TO ITS CONTENTS. WITH DIFFICULTY, FOR
SOMETHING SEEMED TO RESIST HER EFFORTS, SHE RAISED THE LID A FEW INCHES;
BUT AT THAT MOMENT A SUDDEN KNOCKING AT THE DOOR OF THE ROOM MADE HER,
STARTING, QUIT HER HOLD, AND THE LID CLOSED WITH ALARMING VIOLENCE. THIS
ILL-TIMED INTRUDER WAS MISS TILNEY'S MAID, SENT BY HER MISTRESS TO BE OF
USE TO MISS MORLAND; AND THOUGH CATHERINE IMMEDIATELY DISMISSED HER, IT
RECALLED HER TO THE SENSE OF WHAT SHE OUGHT TO BE DOING, AND FORCED HER,
IN SPITE OF HER ANXIOUS DESIRE TO PENETRATE THIS MYSTERY, TO PROCEED IN
HER DRESSING WITHOUT FURTHER DELAY. HER PROGRESS WAS NOT QUICK, FOR HER
THOUGHTS AND HER EYES WERE STILL BENT ON THE OBJECT SO WELL CALCULATED
TO INTEREST AND ALARM; AND THOUGH SHE DARED NOT WASTE A MOMENT UPON
A SECOND ATTEMPT, SHE COULD NOT REMAIN MANY PACES FROM THE CHEST. AT
LENGTH, HOWEVER, HAVING SLIPPED ONE ARM INTO HER GOWN, HER TOILETTE
SEEMED SO NEARLY FINISHED THAT THE IMPATIENCE OF HER CURIOSITY MIGHT
SAFELY BE INDULGED. ONE MOMENT SURELY MIGHT BE SPARED; AND, SO DESPERATE
SHOULD BE THE EXERTION OF HER STRENGTH, THAT, UNLESS SECURED BY
SUPERNATURAL MEANS, THE LID IN ONE MOMENT SHOULD BE THROWN BACK. WITH
THIS SPIRIT SHE SPRANG FORWARD, AND HER CONFIDENCE DID NOT DECEIVE HER.
HER RESOLUTE EFFORT THREW BACK THE LID, AND GAVE TO HER ASTONISHED EYES
THE VIEW OF A WHITE COTTON COUNTERPANE, PROPERLY FOLDED, REPOSING AT ONE
END OF THE CHEST IN UNDISPUTED POSSESSION!

SHE WAS GAZING ON IT WITH THE FIRST BLUSH OF SURPRISE WHEN MISS TILNEY,
ANXIOUS FOR HER FRIEND'S BEING READY, ENTERED THE ROOM, AND TO THE
RISING SHAME OF HAVING HARBOURED FOR SOME MINUTES AN ABSURD EXPECTATION,
WAS THEN ADDED THE SHAME OF BEING CAUGHT IN SO IDLE A SEARCH. "THAT IS
A CURIOUS OLD CHEST, IS NOT IT?" SAID MISS TILNEY, AS CATHERINE HASTILY
CLOSED IT AND TURNED AWAY TO THE GLASS. "IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY HOW
MANY GENERATIONS IT HAS BEEN HERE. HOW IT CAME TO BE FIRST PUT IN THIS
ROOM I KNOW NOT, BUT I HAVE NOT HAD IT MOVED, BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT MIGHT
SOMETIMES BE OF USE IN HOLDING HATS AND BONNETS. THE WORST OF IT IS THAT
ITS WEIGHT MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO OPEN. IN THAT CORNER, HOWEVER, IT IS AT
LEAST OUT OF THE WAY."

CATHERINE HAD NO LEISURE FOR SPEECH, BEING AT ONCE BLUSHING, TYING HER
GOWN, AND FORMING WISE RESOLUTIONS WITH THE MOST VIOLENT DISPATCH. MISS
TILNEY GENTLY HINTED HER FEAR OF BEING LATE; AND IN HALF A MINUTE THEY
RAN DOWNSTAIRS TOGETHER, IN AN ALARM NOT WHOLLY UNFOUNDED, FOR GENERAL
TILNEY WAS PACING THE DRAWING-ROOM, HIS WATCH IN HIS HAND, AND HAVING,
ON THE VERY INSTANT OF THEIR ENTERING, PULLED THE BELL WITH VIOLENCE,
ORDERED "DINNER TO BE ON TABLE DIRECTLY!"

CATHERINE TREMBLED AT THE EMPHASIS WITH WHICH HE SPOKE, AND SAT PALE
AND BREATHLESS, IN A MOST HUMBLE MOOD, CONCERNED FOR HIS CHILDREN, AND
DETESTING OLD CHESTS; AND THE GENERAL, RECOVERING HIS POLITENESS AS HE
LOOKED AT HER, SPENT THE REST OF HIS TIME IN SCOLDING HIS DAUGHTER FOR
SO FOOLISHLY HURRYING HER FAIR FRIEND, WHO WAS ABSOLUTELY OUT OF BREATH
FROM HASTE, WHEN THERE WAS NOT THE LEAST OCCASION FOR HURRY IN THE
WORLD: BUT CATHERINE COULD NOT AT ALL GET OVER THE DOUBLE DISTRESS
OF HAVING INVOLVED HER FRIEND IN A LECTURE AND BEEN A GREAT SIMPLETON
HERSELF, TILL THEY WERE HAPPILY SEATED AT THE DINNER-TABLE, WHEN THE
GENERAL'S COMPLACENT SMILES, AND A GOOD APPETITE OF HER OWN, RESTORED
HER TO PEACE. THE DINING-PARLOUR WAS A NOBLE ROOM, SUITABLE IN ITS
DIMENSIONS TO A MUCH LARGER DRAWING-ROOM THAN THE ONE IN COMMON USE, AND
FITTED UP IN A STYLE OF LUXURY AND EXPENSE WHICH WAS ALMOST LOST ON THE
UNPRACTISED EYE OF CATHERINE, WHO SAW LITTLE MORE THAN ITS SPACIOUSNESS
AND THE NUMBER OF THEIR ATTENDANTS. OF THE FORMER, SHE SPOKE ALOUD
HER ADMIRATION; AND THE GENERAL, WITH A VERY GRACIOUS COUNTENANCE,
ACKNOWLEDGED THAT IT WAS BY NO MEANS AN ILL-SIZED ROOM, AND FURTHER
CONFESSED THAT, THOUGH AS CARELESS ON SUCH SUBJECTS AS MOST PEOPLE, HE
DID LOOK UPON A TOLERABLY LARGE EATING-ROOM AS ONE OF THE NECESSARIES
OF LIFE; HE SUPPOSED, HOWEVER, "THAT SHE MUST HAVE BEEN USED TO MUCH
BETTER-SIZED APARTMENTS AT MR. ALLEN'S?"

"NO, INDEED," WAS CATHERINE'S HONEST ASSURANCE; "MR. ALLEN'S
DINING-PARLOUR WAS NOT MORE THAN HALF AS LARGE," AND SHE HAD NEVER
SEEN SO LARGE A ROOM AS THIS IN HER LIFE. THE GENERAL'S GOOD HUMOUR
INCREASED. WHY, AS HE HAD SUCH ROOMS, HE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE SIMPLE NOT
TO MAKE USE OF THEM; BUT, UPON HIS HONOUR, HE BELIEVED THERE MIGHT BE
MORE COMFORT IN ROOMS OF ONLY HALF THEIR SIZE. MR. ALLEN'S HOUSE, HE WAS
SURE, MUST BE EXACTLY OF THE TRUE SIZE FOR RATIONAL HAPPINESS.

THE EVENING PASSED WITHOUT ANY FURTHER DISTURBANCE, AND, IN THE
OCCASIONAL ABSENCE OF GENERAL TILNEY, WITH MUCH POSITIVE CHEERFULNESS.
IT WAS ONLY IN HIS PRESENCE THAT CATHERINE FELT THE SMALLEST FATIGUE
FROM HER JOURNEY; AND EVEN THEN, EVEN IN MOMENTS OF LANGUOR OR
RESTRAINT, A SENSE OF GENERAL HAPPINESS PREPONDERATED, AND SHE COULD
THINK OF HER FRIENDS IN BATH WITHOUT ONE WISH OF BEING WITH THEM.

THE NIGHT WAS STORMY; THE WIND HAD BEEN RISING AT INTERVALS THE WHOLE
AFTERNOON; AND BY THE TIME THE PARTY BROKE UP, IT BLEW AND RAINED
VIOLENTLY. CATHERINE, AS SHE CROSSED THE HALL, LISTENED TO THE TEMPEST
WITH SENSATIONS OF AWE; AND, WHEN SHE HEARD IT RAGE ROUND A CORNER OF
THE ANCIENT BUILDING AND CLOSE WITH SUDDEN FURY A DISTANT DOOR, FELT
FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT SHE WAS REALLY IN AN ABBEY. YES, THESE WERE
CHARACTERISTIC SOUNDS; THEY BROUGHT TO HER RECOLLECTION A COUNTLESS
VARIETY OF DREADFUL SITUATIONS AND HORRID SCENES, WHICH SUCH BUILDINGS
HAD WITNESSED, AND SUCH STORMS USHERED IN; AND MOST HEARTILY DID SHE
REJOICE IN THE HAPPIER CIRCUMSTANCES ATTENDING HER ENTRANCE WITHIN WALLS
SO SOLEMN! SHE HAD NOTHING TO DREAD FROM MIDNIGHT ASSASSINS OR DRUNKEN
GALLANTS. HENRY HAD CERTAINLY BEEN ONLY IN JEST IN WHAT HE HAD TOLD HER
THAT MORNING. IN A HOUSE SO FURNISHED, AND SO GUARDED, SHE COULD HAVE
NOTHING TO EXPLORE OR TO SUFFER, AND MIGHT GO TO HER BEDROOM AS SECURELY
AS IF IT HAD BEEN HER OWN CHAMBER AT FULLERTON. THUS WISELY FORTIFYING
HER MIND, AS SHE PROCEEDED UPSTAIRS, SHE WAS ENABLED, ESPECIALLY ON
PERCEIVING THAT MISS TILNEY SLEPT ONLY TWO DOORS FROM HER, TO ENTER
HER ROOM WITH A TOLERABLY STOUT HEART; AND HER SPIRITS WERE IMMEDIATELY
ASSISTED BY THE CHEERFUL BLAZE OF A WOOD FIRE. "HOW MUCH BETTER IS
THIS," SAID SHE, AS SHE WALKED TO THE FENDER--"HOW MUCH BETTER TO FIND A
FIRE READY LIT, THAN TO HAVE TO WAIT SHIVERING IN THE COLD TILL ALL THE
FAMILY ARE IN BED, AS SO MANY POOR GIRLS HAVE BEEN OBLIGED TO DO, AND
THEN TO HAVE A FAITHFUL OLD SERVANT FRIGHTENING ONE BY COMING IN WITH A
FAGGOT! HOW GLAD I AM THAT NORTHANGER IS WHAT IT IS! IF IT HAD BEEN LIKE
SOME OTHER PLACES, I DO NOT KNOW THAT, IN SUCH A NIGHT AS THIS, I COULD
HAVE ANSWERED FOR MY COURAGE: BUT NOW, TO BE SURE, THERE IS NOTHING TO
ALARM ONE."

SHE LOOKED ROUND THE ROOM. THE WINDOW CURTAINS SEEMED IN MOTION. IT
COULD BE NOTHING BUT THE VIOLENCE OF THE WIND PENETRATING THROUGH THE
DIVISIONS OF THE SHUTTERS; AND SHE STEPPED BOLDLY FORWARD, CARELESSLY
HUMMING A TUNE, TO ASSURE HERSELF OF ITS BEING SO, PEEPED COURAGEOUSLY
BEHIND EACH CURTAIN, SAW NOTHING ON EITHER LOW WINDOW SEAT TO SCARE HER,
AND ON PLACING A HAND AGAINST THE SHUTTER, FELT THE STRONGEST CONVICTION
OF THE WIND'S FORCE. A GLANCE AT THE OLD CHEST, AS SHE TURNED AWAY FROM
THIS EXAMINATION, WAS NOT WITHOUT ITS USE; SHE SCORNED THE CAUSELESS
FEARS OF AN IDLE FANCY, AND BEGAN WITH A MOST HAPPY INDIFFERENCE TO
PREPARE HERSELF FOR BED. "SHE SHOULD TAKE HER TIME; SHE SHOULD NOT HURRY
HERSELF; SHE DID NOT CARE IF SHE WERE THE LAST PERSON UP IN THE HOUSE.
BUT SHE WOULD NOT MAKE UP HER FIRE; THAT WOULD SEEM COWARDLY, AS IF
SHE WISHED FOR THE PROTECTION OF LIGHT AFTER SHE WERE IN BED." THE FIRE
THEREFORE DIED AWAY, AND CATHERINE, HAVING SPENT THE BEST PART OF AN
HOUR IN HER ARRANGEMENTS, WAS BEGINNING TO THINK OF STEPPING INTO BED,
WHEN, ON GIVING A PARTING GLANCE ROUND THE ROOM, SHE WAS STRUCK BY THE
APPEARANCE OF A HIGH, OLD-FASHIONED BLACK CABINET, WHICH, THOUGH IN
A SITUATION CONSPICUOUS ENOUGH, HAD NEVER CAUGHT HER NOTICE BEFORE.
HENRY'S WORDS, HIS DESCRIPTION OF THE EBONY CABINET WHICH WAS TO ESCAPE
HER OBSERVATION AT FIRST, IMMEDIATELY RUSHED ACROSS HER; AND THOUGH
THERE COULD BE NOTHING REALLY IN IT, THERE WAS SOMETHING WHIMSICAL, IT
WAS CERTAINLY A VERY REMARKABLE COINCIDENCE! SHE TOOK HER CANDLE AND
LOOKED CLOSELY AT THE CABINET. IT WAS NOT ABSOLUTELY EBONY AND GOLD; BUT
IT WAS JAPAN, BLACK AND YELLOW JAPAN OF THE HANDSOMEST KIND; AND AS SHE
HELD HER CANDLE, THE YELLOW HAD VERY MUCH THE EFFECT OF GOLD. THE KEY
WAS IN THE DOOR, AND SHE HAD A STRANGE FANCY TO LOOK INTO IT; NOT,
HOWEVER, WITH THE SMALLEST EXPECTATION OF FINDING ANYTHING, BUT IT WAS
SO VERY ODD, AFTER WHAT HENRY HAD SAID. IN SHORT, SHE COULD NOT SLEEP
TILL SHE HAD EXAMINED IT. SO, PLACING THE CANDLE WITH GREAT CAUTION ON
A CHAIR, SHE SEIZED THE KEY WITH A VERY TREMULOUS HAND AND TRIED TO TURN
IT; BUT IT RESISTED HER UTMOST STRENGTH. ALARMED, BUT NOT DISCOURAGED,
SHE TRIED IT ANOTHER WAY; A BOLT FLEW, AND SHE BELIEVED HERSELF
SUCCESSFUL; BUT HOW STRANGELY MYSTERIOUS! THE DOOR WAS STILL IMMOVABLE.
SHE PAUSED A MOMENT IN BREATHLESS WONDER. THE WIND ROARED DOWN THE
CHIMNEY, THE RAIN BEAT IN TORRENTS AGAINST THE WINDOWS, AND EVERYTHING
SEEMED TO SPEAK THE AWFULNESS OF HER SITUATION. TO RETIRE TO BED,
HOWEVER, UNSATISFIED ON SUCH A POINT, WOULD BE VAIN, SINCE SLEEP MUST BE
IMPOSSIBLE WITH THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF A CABINET SO MYSTERIOUSLY CLOSED
IN HER IMMEDIATE VICINITY. AGAIN, THEREFORE, SHE APPLIED HERSELF TO THE
KEY, AND AFTER MOVING IT IN EVERY POSSIBLE WAY FOR SOME INSTANTS WITH
THE DETERMINED CELERITY OF HOPE'S LAST EFFORT, THE DOOR SUDDENLY YIELDED
TO HER HAND: HER HEART LEAPED WITH EXULTATION AT SUCH A VICTORY, AND
HAVING THROWN OPEN EACH FOLDING DOOR, THE SECOND BEING SECURED ONLY BY
BOLTS OF LESS WONDERFUL CONSTRUCTION THAN THE LOCK, THOUGH IN THAT HER
EYE COULD NOT DISCERN ANYTHING UNUSUAL, A DOUBLE RANGE OF SMALL DRAWERS
APPEARED IN VIEW, WITH SOME LARGER DRAWERS ABOVE AND BELOW THEM; AND IN
THE CENTRE, A SMALL DOOR, CLOSED ALSO WITH A LOCK AND KEY, SECURED IN
ALL PROBABILITY A CAVITY OF IMPORTANCE.

CATHERINE'S HEART BEAT QUICK, BUT HER COURAGE DID NOT FAIL HER. WITH A
CHEEK FLUSHED BY HOPE, AND AN EYE STRAINING WITH CURIOSITY, HER FINGERS
GRASPED THE HANDLE OF A DRAWER AND DREW IT FORTH. IT WAS ENTIRELY EMPTY.
WITH LESS ALARM AND GREATER EAGERNESS SHE SEIZED A SECOND, A THIRD, A
FOURTH; EACH WAS EQUALLY EMPTY. NOT ONE WAS LEFT UNSEARCHED, AND IN NOT
ONE WAS ANYTHING FOUND. WELL READ IN THE ART OF CONCEALING A TREASURE,
THE POSSIBILITY OF FALSE LININGS TO THE DRAWERS DID NOT ESCAPE HER, AND
SHE FELT ROUND EACH WITH ANXIOUS ACUTENESS IN VAIN. THE PLACE IN THE
MIDDLE ALONE REMAINED NOW UNEXPLORED; AND THOUGH SHE HAD "NEVER FROM
THE FIRST HAD THE SMALLEST IDEA OF FINDING ANYTHING IN ANY PART OF THE
CABINET, AND WAS NOT IN THE LEAST DISAPPOINTED AT HER ILL SUCCESS THUS
FAR, IT WOULD BE FOOLISH NOT TO EXAMINE IT THOROUGHLY WHILE SHE WAS
ABOUT IT." IT WAS SOME TIME HOWEVER BEFORE SHE COULD UNFASTEN THE DOOR,
THE SAME DIFFICULTY OCCURRING IN THE MANAGEMENT OF THIS INNER LOCK AS OF
THE OUTER; BUT AT LENGTH IT DID OPEN; AND NOT VAIN, AS HITHERTO, WAS HER
SEARCH; HER QUICK EYES DIRECTLY FELL ON A ROLL OF PAPER PUSHED BACK
INTO THE FURTHER PART OF THE CAVITY, APPARENTLY FOR CONCEALMENT, AND
HER FEELINGS AT THAT MOMENT WERE INDESCRIBABLE. HER HEART FLUTTERED, HER
KNEES TREMBLED, AND HER CHEEKS GREW PALE. SHE SEIZED, WITH AN UNSTEADY
HAND, THE PRECIOUS MANUSCRIPT, FOR HALF A GLANCE SUFFICED TO ASCERTAIN
WRITTEN CHARACTERS; AND WHILE SHE ACKNOWLEDGED WITH AWFUL SENSATIONS
THIS STRIKING EXEMPLIFICATION OF WHAT HENRY HAD FORETOLD, RESOLVED
INSTANTLY TO PERUSE EVERY LINE BEFORE SHE ATTEMPTED TO REST.

THE DIMNESS OF THE LIGHT HER CANDLE EMITTED MADE HER TURN TO IT WITH
ALARM; BUT THERE WAS NO DANGER OF ITS SUDDEN EXTINCTION; IT HAD YET SOME
HOURS TO BURN; AND THAT SHE MIGHT NOT HAVE ANY GREATER DIFFICULTY IN
DISTINGUISHING THE WRITING THAN WHAT ITS ANCIENT DATE MIGHT OCCASION,
SHE HASTILY SNUFFED IT. ALAS! IT WAS SNUFFED AND EXTINGUISHED IN ONE. A
LAMP COULD NOT HAVE EXPIRED WITH MORE AWFUL EFFECT. CATHERINE, FOR A
FEW MOMENTS, WAS MOTIONLESS WITH HORROR. IT WAS DONE COMPLETELY; NOT A
REMNANT OF LIGHT IN THE WICK COULD GIVE HOPE TO THE REKINDLING BREATH.
DARKNESS IMPENETRABLE AND IMMOVABLE FILLED THE ROOM. A VIOLENT GUST
OF WIND, RISING WITH SUDDEN FURY, ADDED FRESH HORROR TO THE MOMENT.
CATHERINE TREMBLED FROM HEAD TO FOOT. IN THE PAUSE WHICH SUCCEEDED, A
SOUND LIKE RECEDING FOOTSTEPS AND THE CLOSING OF A DISTANT DOOR STRUCK
ON HER AFFRIGHTED EAR. HUMAN NATURE COULD SUPPORT NO MORE. A COLD SWEAT
STOOD ON HER FOREHEAD, THE MANUSCRIPT FELL FROM HER HAND, AND GROPING
HER WAY TO THE BED, SHE JUMPED HASTILY IN, AND SOUGHT SOME SUSPENSION OF
AGONY BY CREEPING FAR UNDERNEATH THE CLOTHES. TO CLOSE HER EYES IN
SLEEP THAT NIGHT, SHE FELT MUST BE ENTIRELY OUT OF THE QUESTION. WITH
A CURIOSITY SO JUSTLY AWAKENED, AND FEELINGS IN EVERY WAY SO AGITATED,
REPOSE MUST BE ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE. THE STORM TOO ABROAD SO DREADFUL!
SHE HAD NOT BEEN USED TO FEEL ALARM FROM WIND, BUT NOW EVERY BLAST
SEEMED FRAUGHT WITH AWFUL INTELLIGENCE. THE MANUSCRIPT SO WONDERFULLY
FOUND, SO WONDERFULLY ACCOMPLISHING THE MORNING'S PREDICTION, HOW WAS IT
TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR? WHAT COULD IT CONTAIN? TO WHOM COULD IT RELATE?
BY WHAT MEANS COULD IT HAVE BEEN SO LONG CONCEALED? AND HOW SINGULARLY
STRANGE THAT IT SHOULD FALL TO HER LOT TO DISCOVER IT! TILL SHE HAD MADE
HERSELF MISTRESS OF ITS CONTENTS, HOWEVER, SHE COULD HAVE NEITHER REPOSE
NOR COMFORT; AND WITH THE SUN'S FIRST RAYS SHE WAS DETERMINED TO PERUSE
IT. BUT MANY WERE THE TEDIOUS HOURS WHICH MUST YET INTERVENE. SHE
SHUDDERED, TOSSED ABOUT IN HER BED, AND ENVIED EVERY QUIET SLEEPER. THE
STORM STILL RAGED, AND VARIOUS WERE THE NOISES, MORE TERRIFIC EVEN
THAN THE WIND, WHICH STRUCK AT INTERVALS ON HER STARTLED EAR. THE VERY
CURTAINS OF HER BED SEEMED AT ONE MOMENT IN MOTION, AND AT ANOTHER
THE LOCK OF HER DOOR WAS AGITATED, AS IF BY THE ATTEMPT OF SOMEBODY TO
ENTER. HOLLOW MURMURS SEEMED TO CREEP ALONG THE GALLERY, AND MORE THAN
ONCE HER BLOOD WAS CHILLED BY THE SOUND OF DISTANT MOANS. HOUR AFTER
HOUR PASSED AWAY, AND THE WEARIED CATHERINE HAD HEARD THREE PROCLAIMED
BY ALL THE CLOCKS IN THE HOUSE BEFORE THE TEMPEST SUBSIDED OR SHE
UNKNOWINGLY FELL FAST ASLEEP.




CHAPTER 22


THE HOUSEMAID'S FOLDING BACK HER WINDOW-SHUTTERS AT EIGHT O'CLOCK THE
NEXT DAY WAS THE SOUND WHICH FIRST ROUSED CATHERINE; AND SHE OPENED HER
EYES, WONDERING THAT THEY COULD EVER HAVE BEEN CLOSED, ON OBJECTS OF
CHEERFULNESS; HER FIRE WAS ALREADY BURNING, AND A BRIGHT MORNING
HAD SUCCEEDED THE TEMPEST OF THE NIGHT. INSTANTANEOUSLY, WITH THE
CONSCIOUSNESS OF EXISTENCE, RETURNED HER RECOLLECTION OF THE MANUSCRIPT;
AND SPRINGING FROM THE BED IN THE VERY MOMENT OF THE MAID'S GOING AWAY,
SHE EAGERLY COLLECTED EVERY SCATTERED SHEET WHICH HAD BURST FROM THE
ROLL ON ITS FALLING TO THE GROUND, AND FLEW BACK TO ENJOY THE LUXURY
OF THEIR PERUSAL ON HER PILLOW. SHE NOW PLAINLY SAW THAT SHE MUST NOT
EXPECT A MANUSCRIPT OF EQUAL LENGTH WITH THE GENERALITY OF WHAT SHE HAD
SHUDDERED OVER IN BOOKS, FOR THE ROLL, SEEMING TO CONSIST ENTIRELY OF
SMALL DISJOINTED SHEETS, WAS ALTOGETHER BUT OF TRIFLING SIZE, AND MUCH
LESS THAN SHE HAD SUPPOSED IT TO BE AT FIRST.

HER GREEDY EYE GLANCED RAPIDLY OVER A PAGE. SHE STARTED AT ITS IMPORT.
COULD IT BE POSSIBLE, OR DID NOT HER SENSES PLAY HER FALSE? AN INVENTORY
OF LINEN, IN COARSE AND MODERN CHARACTERS, SEEMED ALL THAT WAS BEFORE
HER! IF THE EVIDENCE OF SIGHT MIGHT BE TRUSTED, SHE HELD A WASHING-BILL
IN HER HAND. SHE SEIZED ANOTHER SHEET, AND SAW THE SAME ARTICLES WITH
LITTLE VARIATION; A THIRD, A FOURTH, AND A FIFTH PRESENTED NOTHING
NEW. SHIRTS, STOCKINGS, CRAVATS, AND WAISTCOATS FACED HER IN EACH. TWO
OTHERS, PENNED BY THE SAME HAND, MARKED AN EXPENDITURE SCARCELY MORE
INTERESTING, IN LETTERS, HAIR-POWDER, SHOE-STRING, AND BREECHES-BALL.
AND THE LARGER SHEET, WHICH HAD ENCLOSED THE REST, SEEMED BY ITS FIRST
CRAMP LINE, "TO POULTICE CHESTNUT MARE"--A FARRIER'S BILL! SUCH WAS THE
COLLECTION OF PAPERS (LEFT PERHAPS, AS SHE COULD THEN SUPPOSE, BY THE
NEGLIGENCE OF A SERVANT IN THE PLACE WHENCE SHE HAD TAKEN THEM) WHICH
HAD FILLED HER WITH EXPECTATION AND ALARM, AND ROBBED HER OF HALF HER
NIGHT'S REST! SHE FELT HUMBLED TO THE DUST. COULD NOT THE ADVENTURE OF
THE CHEST HAVE TAUGHT HER WISDOM? A CORNER OF IT, CATCHING HER EYE AS
SHE LAY, SEEMED TO RISE UP IN JUDGMENT AGAINST HER. NOTHING COULD NOW
BE CLEARER THAN THE ABSURDITY OF HER RECENT FANCIES. TO SUPPOSE THAT A
MANUSCRIPT OF MANY GENERATIONS BACK COULD HAVE REMAINED UNDISCOVERED IN
A ROOM SUCH AS THAT, SO MODERN, SO HABITABLE!--OR THAT SHE SHOULD BE THE
FIRST TO POSSESS THE SKILL OF UNLOCKING A CABINET, THE KEY OF WHICH WAS
OPEN TO ALL!

HOW COULD SHE HAVE SO IMPOSED ON HERSELF? HEAVEN FORBID THAT HENRY
TILNEY SHOULD EVER KNOW HER FOLLY! AND IT WAS IN A GREAT MEASURE HIS
OWN DOING, FOR HAD NOT THE CABINET APPEARED SO EXACTLY TO AGREE WITH HIS
DESCRIPTION OF HER ADVENTURES, SHE SHOULD NEVER HAVE FELT THE SMALLEST
CURIOSITY ABOUT IT. THIS WAS THE ONLY COMFORT THAT OCCURRED. IMPATIENT
TO GET RID OF THOSE HATEFUL EVIDENCES OF HER FOLLY, THOSE DETESTABLE
PAPERS THEN SCATTERED OVER THE BED, SHE ROSE DIRECTLY, AND FOLDING THEM
UP AS NEARLY AS POSSIBLE IN THE SAME SHAPE AS BEFORE, RETURNED THEM
TO THE SAME SPOT WITHIN THE CABINET, WITH A VERY HEARTY WISH THAT NO
UNTOWARD ACCIDENT MIGHT EVER BRING THEM FORWARD AGAIN, TO DISGRACE HER
EVEN WITH HERSELF.

WHY THE LOCKS SHOULD HAVE BEEN SO DIFFICULT TO OPEN, HOWEVER, WAS STILL
SOMETHING REMARKABLE, FOR SHE COULD NOW MANAGE THEM WITH PERFECT EASE.
IN THIS THERE WAS SURELY SOMETHING MYSTERIOUS, AND SHE INDULGED IN THE
FLATTERING SUGGESTION FOR HALF A MINUTE, TILL THE POSSIBILITY OF THE
DOOR'S HAVING BEEN AT FIRST UNLOCKED, AND OF BEING HERSELF ITS FASTENER,
DARTED INTO HER HEAD, AND COST HER ANOTHER BLUSH.

SHE GOT AWAY AS SOON AS SHE COULD FROM A ROOM IN WHICH HER CONDUCT
PRODUCED SUCH UNPLEASANT REFLECTIONS, AND FOUND HER WAY WITH ALL SPEED
TO THE BREAKFAST-PARLOUR, AS IT HAD BEEN POINTED OUT TO HER BY MISS
TILNEY THE EVENING BEFORE. HENRY WAS ALONE IN IT; AND HIS IMMEDIATE HOPE
OF HER HAVING BEEN UNDISTURBED BY THE TEMPEST, WITH AN ARCH REFERENCE
TO THE CHARACTER OF THE BUILDING THEY INHABITED, WAS RATHER DISTRESSING.
FOR THE WORLD WOULD SHE NOT HAVE HER WEAKNESS SUSPECTED, AND YET,
UNEQUAL TO AN ABSOLUTE FALSEHOOD, WAS CONSTRAINED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT
THE WIND HAD KEPT HER AWAKE A LITTLE. "BUT WE HAVE A CHARMING MORNING
AFTER IT," SHE ADDED, DESIRING TO GET RID OF THE SUBJECT; "AND STORMS
AND SLEEPLESSNESS ARE NOTHING WHEN THEY ARE OVER. WHAT BEAUTIFUL
HYACINTHS! I HAVE JUST LEARNT TO LOVE A HYACINTH."

"AND HOW MIGHT YOU LEARN? BY ACCIDENT OR ARGUMENT?"

"YOUR SISTER TAUGHT ME; I CANNOT TELL HOW. MRS. ALLEN USED TO TAKE
PAINS, YEAR AFTER YEAR, TO MAKE ME LIKE THEM; BUT I NEVER COULD, TILL
I SAW THEM THE OTHER DAY IN MILSOM STREET; I AM NATURALLY INDIFFERENT
ABOUT FLOWERS."

"BUT NOW YOU LOVE A HYACINTH. SO MUCH THE BETTER. YOU HAVE GAINED A NEW
SOURCE OF ENJOYMENT, AND IT IS WELL TO HAVE AS MANY HOLDS UPON HAPPINESS
AS POSSIBLE. BESIDES, A TASTE FOR FLOWERS IS ALWAYS DESIRABLE IN YOUR
SEX, AS A MEANS OF GETTING YOU OUT OF DOORS, AND TEMPTING YOU TO MORE
FREQUENT EXERCISE THAN YOU WOULD OTHERWISE TAKE. AND THOUGH THE LOVE
OF A HYACINTH MAY BE RATHER DOMESTIC, WHO CAN TELL, THE SENTIMENT ONCE
RAISED, BUT YOU MAY IN TIME COME TO LOVE A ROSE?"

"BUT I DO NOT WANT ANY SUCH PURSUIT TO GET ME OUT OF DOORS. THE PLEASURE
OF WALKING AND BREATHING FRESH AIR IS ENOUGH FOR ME, AND IN FINE WEATHER
I AM OUT MORE THAN HALF MY TIME. MAMMA SAYS I AM NEVER WITHIN."

"AT ANY RATE, HOWEVER, I AM PLEASED THAT YOU HAVE LEARNT TO LOVE
A HYACINTH. THE MERE HABIT OF LEARNING TO LOVE IS THE THING; AND A
TEACHABLENESS OF DISPOSITION IN A YOUNG LADY IS A GREAT BLESSING. HAS MY
SISTER A PLEASANT MODE OF INSTRUCTION?"

CATHERINE WAS SAVED THE EMBARRASSMENT OF ATTEMPTING AN ANSWER BY THE
ENTRANCE OF THE GENERAL, WHOSE SMILING COMPLIMENTS ANNOUNCED A HAPPY
STATE OF MIND, BUT WHOSE GENTLE HINT OF SYMPATHETIC EARLY RISING DID NOT
ADVANCE HER COMPOSURE.

THE ELEGANCE OF THE BREAKFAST SET FORCED ITSELF ON CATHERINE'S NOTICE
WHEN THEY WERE SEATED AT TABLE; AND, LUCIDLY, IT HAD BEEN THE GENERAL'S
CHOICE. HE WAS ENCHANTED BY HER APPROBATION OF HIS TASTE, CONFESSED IT
TO BE NEAT AND SIMPLE, THOUGHT IT RIGHT TO ENCOURAGE THE MANUFACTURE OF
HIS COUNTRY; AND FOR HIS PART, TO HIS UNCRITICAL PALATE, THE TEA WAS AS
WELL FLAVOURED FROM THE CLAY OF STAFFORDSHIRE, AS FROM THAT OF DRESDEN
OR SAVE. BUT THIS WAS QUITE AN OLD SET, PURCHASED TWO YEARS AGO.
THE MANUFACTURE WAS MUCH IMPROVED SINCE THAT TIME; HE HAD SEEN SOME
BEAUTIFUL SPECIMENS WHEN LAST IN TOWN, AND HAD HE NOT BEEN PERFECTLY
WITHOUT VANITY OF THAT KIND, MIGHT HAVE BEEN TEMPTED TO ORDER A NEW
SET. HE TRUSTED, HOWEVER, THAT AN OPPORTUNITY MIGHT ERE LONG OCCUR OF
SELECTING ONE--THOUGH NOT FOR HIMSELF. CATHERINE WAS PROBABLY THE ONLY
ONE OF THE PARTY WHO DID NOT UNDERSTAND HIM.

SHORTLY AFTER BREAKFAST HENRY LEFT THEM FOR WOODSTON, WHERE BUSINESS
REQUIRED AND WOULD KEEP HIM TWO OR THREE DAYS. THEY ALL ATTENDED IN
THE HALL TO SEE HIM MOUNT HIS HORSE, AND IMMEDIATELY ON RE-ENTERING THE
BREAKFAST-ROOM, CATHERINE WALKED TO A WINDOW IN THE HOPE OF CATCHING
ANOTHER GLIMPSE OF HIS FIGURE. "THIS IS A SOMEWHAT HEAVY CALL UPON YOUR
BROTHER'S FORTITUDE," OBSERVED THE GENERAL TO ELEANOR. "WOODSTON WILL
MAKE BUT A SOMBRE APPEARANCE TODAY."

"IS IT A PRETTY PLACE?" ASKED CATHERINE.

"WHAT SAY YOU, ELEANOR? SPEAK YOUR OPINION, FOR LADIES CAN BEST TELL THE
TASTE OF LADIES IN REGARD TO PLACES AS WELL AS MEN. I THINK IT WOULD BE
ACKNOWLEDGED BY THE MOST IMPARTIAL EYE TO HAVE MANY RECOMMENDATIONS. THE
HOUSE STANDS AMONG FINE MEADOWS FACING THE SOUTH-EAST, WITH AN EXCELLENT
KITCHEN-GARDEN IN THE SAME ASPECT; THE WALLS SURROUNDING WHICH I BUILT
AND STOCKED MYSELF ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO, FOR THE BENEFIT OF MY SON. IT
IS A FAMILY LIVING, MISS MORLAND; AND THE PROPERTY IN THE PLACE BEING
CHIEFLY MY OWN, YOU MAY BELIEVE I TAKE CARE THAT IT SHALL NOT BE A BAD
ONE. DID HENRY'S INCOME DEPEND SOLELY ON THIS LIVING, HE WOULD NOT BE
ILL-PROVIDED FOR. PERHAPS IT MAY SEEM ODD, THAT WITH ONLY TWO YOUNGER
CHILDREN, I SHOULD THINK ANY PROFESSION NECESSARY FOR HIM; AND CERTAINLY
THERE ARE MOMENTS WHEN WE COULD ALL WISH HIM DISENGAGED FROM EVERY TIE
OF BUSINESS. BUT THOUGH I MAY NOT EXACTLY MAKE CONVERTS OF YOU YOUNG
LADIES, I AM SURE YOUR FATHER, MISS MORLAND, WOULD AGREE WITH ME IN
THINKING IT EXPEDIENT TO GIVE EVERY YOUNG MAN SOME EMPLOYMENT. THE
MONEY IS NOTHING, IT IS NOT AN OBJECT, BUT EMPLOYMENT IS THE THING.
EVEN FREDERICK, MY ELDEST SON, YOU SEE, WHO WILL PERHAPS INHERIT AS
CONSIDERABLE A LANDED PROPERTY AS ANY PRIVATE MAN IN THE COUNTY, HAS HIS
PROFESSION."

THE IMPOSING EFFECT OF THIS LAST ARGUMENT WAS EQUAL TO HIS WISHES. THE
SILENCE OF THE LADY PROVED IT TO BE UNANSWERABLE.

SOMETHING HAD BEEN SAID THE EVENING BEFORE OF HER BEING SHOWN OVER THE
HOUSE, AND HE NOW OFFERED HIMSELF AS HER CONDUCTOR; AND THOUGH CATHERINE
HAD HOPED TO EXPLORE IT ACCOMPANIED ONLY BY HIS DAUGHTER, IT WAS A
PROPOSAL OF TOO MUCH HAPPINESS IN ITSELF, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, NOT
TO BE GLADLY ACCEPTED; FOR SHE HAD BEEN ALREADY EIGHTEEN HOURS IN THE
ABBEY, AND HAD SEEN ONLY A FEW OF ITS ROOMS. THE NETTING-BOX, JUST
LEISURELY DRAWN FORTH, WAS CLOSED WITH JOYFUL HASTE, AND SHE WAS READY
TO ATTEND HIM IN A MOMENT. "AND WHEN THEY HAD GONE OVER THE HOUSE, HE
PROMISED HIMSELF MOREOVER THE PLEASURE OF ACCOMPANYING HER INTO THE
SHRUBBERIES AND GARDEN." SHE CURTSIED HER ACQUIESCENCE. "BUT PERHAPS
IT MIGHT BE MORE AGREEABLE TO HER TO MAKE THOSE HER FIRST OBJECT.
THE WEATHER WAS AT PRESENT FAVOURABLE, AND AT THIS TIME OF YEAR THE
UNCERTAINTY WAS VERY GREAT OF ITS CONTINUING SO. WHICH WOULD SHE PREFER?
HE WAS EQUALLY AT HER SERVICE. WHICH DID HIS DAUGHTER THINK WOULD MOST
ACCORD WITH HER FAIR FRIEND'S WISHES? BUT HE THOUGHT HE COULD DISCERN.
YES, HE CERTAINLY READ IN MISS MORLAND'S EYES A JUDICIOUS DESIRE OF
MAKING USE OF THE PRESENT SMILING WEATHER. BUT WHEN DID SHE JUDGE AMISS?
THE ABBEY WOULD BE ALWAYS SAFE AND DRY. HE YIELDED IMPLICITLY, AND
WOULD FETCH HIS HAT AND ATTEND THEM IN A MOMENT." HE LEFT THE ROOM,
AND CATHERINE, WITH A DISAPPOINTED, ANXIOUS FACE, BEGAN TO SPEAK OF HER
UNWILLINGNESS THAT HE SHOULD BE TAKING THEM OUT OF DOORS AGAINST HIS OWN
INCLINATION, UNDER A MISTAKEN IDEA OF PLEASING HER; BUT SHE WAS STOPPED
BY MISS TILNEY'S SAYING, WITH A LITTLE CONFUSION, "I BELIEVE IT WILL BE
WISEST TO TAKE THE MORNING WHILE IT IS SO FINE; AND DO NOT BE UNEASY ON
MY FATHER'S ACCOUNT; HE ALWAYS WALKS OUT AT THIS TIME OF DAY."

CATHERINE DID NOT EXACTLY KNOW HOW THIS WAS TO BE UNDERSTOOD. WHY
WAS MISS TILNEY EMBARRASSED? COULD THERE BE ANY UNWILLINGNESS ON THE
GENERAL'S SIDE TO SHOW HER OVER THE ABBEY? THE PROPOSAL WAS HIS OWN. AND
WAS NOT IT ODD THAT HE SHOULD ALWAYS TAKE HIS WALK SO EARLY? NEITHER HER
FATHER NOR MR. ALLEN DID SO. IT WAS CERTAINLY VERY PROVOKING. SHE WAS
ALL IMPATIENCE TO SEE THE HOUSE, AND HAD SCARCELY ANY CURIOSITY ABOUT
THE GROUNDS. IF HENRY HAD BEEN WITH THEM INDEED! BUT NOW SHE SHOULD NOT
KNOW WHAT WAS PICTURESQUE WHEN SHE SAW IT. SUCH WERE HER THOUGHTS, BUT
SHE KEPT THEM TO HERSELF, AND PUT ON HER BONNET IN PATIENT DISCONTENT.

SHE WAS STRUCK, HOWEVER, BEYOND HER EXPECTATION, BY THE GRANDEUR OF
THE ABBEY, AS SHE SAW IT FOR THE FIRST TIME FROM THE LAWN. THE WHOLE
BUILDING ENCLOSED A LARGE COURT; AND TWO SIDES OF THE QUADRANGLE, RICH
IN GOTHIC ORNAMENTS, STOOD FORWARD FOR ADMIRATION. THE REMAINDER WAS
SHUT OFF BY KNOLLS OF OLD TREES, OR LUXURIANT PLANTATIONS, AND THE STEEP
WOODY HILLS RISING BEHIND, TO GIVE IT SHELTER, WERE BEAUTIFUL EVEN IN
THE LEAFLESS MONTH OF MARCH. CATHERINE HAD SEEN NOTHING TO COMPARE WITH
IT; AND HER FEELINGS OF DELIGHT WERE SO STRONG, THAT WITHOUT WAITING FOR
ANY BETTER AUTHORITY, SHE BOLDLY BURST FORTH IN WONDER AND PRAISE. THE
GENERAL LISTENED WITH ASSENTING GRATITUDE; AND IT SEEMED AS IF HIS OWN
ESTIMATION OF NORTHANGER HAD WAITED UNFIXED TILL THAT HOUR.

THE KITCHEN-GARDEN WAS TO BE NEXT ADMIRED, AND HE LED THE WAY TO IT
ACROSS A SMALL PORTION OF THE PARK.

THE NUMBER OF ACRES CONTAINED IN THIS GARDEN WAS SUCH AS CATHERINE COULD
NOT LISTEN TO WITHOUT DISMAY, BEING MORE THAN DOUBLE THE EXTENT OF ALL
MR. ALLEN'S, AS WELL HER FATHER'S, INCLUDING CHURCH-YARD AND ORCHARD.
THE WALLS SEEMED COUNTLESS IN NUMBER, ENDLESS IN LENGTH; A VILLAGE OF
HOT-HOUSES SEEMED TO ARISE AMONG THEM, AND A WHOLE PARISH TO BE AT
WORK WITHIN THE ENCLOSURE. THE GENERAL WAS FLATTERED BY HER LOOKS OF
SURPRISE, WHICH TOLD HIM ALMOST AS PLAINLY, AS HE SOON FORCED HER TO
TELL HIM IN WORDS, THAT SHE HAD NEVER SEEN ANY GARDENS AT ALL EQUAL TO
THEM BEFORE; AND HE THEN MODESTLY OWNED THAT, "WITHOUT ANY AMBITION OF
THAT SORT HIMSELF--WITHOUT ANY SOLICITUDE ABOUT IT--HE DID BELIEVE THEM
TO BE UNRIVALLED IN THE KINGDOM. IF HE HAD A HOBBY-HORSE, IT WAS THAT.
HE LOVED A GARDEN. THOUGH CARELESS ENOUGH IN MOST MATTERS OF EATING, HE
LOVED GOOD FRUIT--OR IF HE DID NOT, HIS FRIENDS AND CHILDREN DID. THERE
WERE GREAT VEXATIONS, HOWEVER, ATTENDING SUCH A GARDEN AS HIS. THE
UTMOST CARE COULD NOT ALWAYS SECURE THE MOST VALUABLE FRUITS. THE PINERY
HAD YIELDED ONLY ONE HUNDRED IN THE LAST YEAR. MR. ALLEN, HE SUPPOSED,
MUST FEEL THESE INCONVENIENCES AS WELL AS HIMSELF."

"NO, NOT AT ALL. MR. ALLEN DID NOT CARE ABOUT THE GARDEN, AND NEVER WENT
INTO IT."

WITH A TRIUMPHANT SMILE OF SELF-SATISFACTION, THE GENERAL WISHED HE
COULD DO THE SAME, FOR HE NEVER ENTERED HIS, WITHOUT BEING VEXED IN SOME
WAY OR OTHER, BY ITS FALLING SHORT OF HIS PLAN.

"HOW WERE MR. ALLEN'S SUCCESSION-HOUSES WORKED?" DESCRIBING THE NATURE
OF HIS OWN AS THEY ENTERED THEM.

"MR. ALLEN HAD ONLY ONE SMALL HOT-HOUSE, WHICH MRS. ALLEN HAD THE USE OF
FOR HER PLANTS IN WINTER, AND THERE WAS A FIRE IN IT NOW AND THEN."

"HE IS A HAPPY MAN!" SAID THE GENERAL, WITH A LOOK OF VERY HAPPY
CONTEMPT.

HAVING TAKEN HER INTO EVERY DIVISION, AND LED HER UNDER EVERY WALL, TILL
SHE WAS HEARTILY WEARY OF SEEING AND WONDERING, HE SUFFERED THE GIRLS
AT LAST TO SEIZE THE ADVANTAGE OF AN OUTER DOOR, AND THEN EXPRESSING
HIS WISH TO EXAMINE THE EFFECT OF SOME RECENT ALTERATIONS ABOUT THE
TEA-HOUSE, PROPOSED IT AS NO UNPLEASANT EXTENSION OF THEIR WALK, IF MISS
MORLAND WERE NOT TIRED. "BUT WHERE ARE YOU GOING, ELEANOR? WHY DO YOU
CHOOSE THAT COLD, DAMP PATH TO IT? MISS MORLAND WILL GET WET. OUR BEST
WAY IS ACROSS THE PARK."

"THIS IS SO FAVOURITE A WALK OF MINE," SAID MISS TILNEY, "THAT I ALWAYS
THINK IT THE BEST AND NEAREST WAY. BUT PERHAPS IT MAY BE DAMP."

IT WAS A NARROW WINDING PATH THROUGH A THICK GROVE OF OLD SCOTCH FIRS;
AND CATHERINE, STRUCK BY ITS GLOOMY ASPECT, AND EAGER TO ENTER IT,
COULD NOT, EVEN BY THE GENERAL'S DISAPPROBATION, BE KEPT FROM STEPPING
FORWARD. HE PERCEIVED HER INCLINATION, AND HAVING AGAIN URGED THE PLEA
OF HEALTH IN VAIN, WAS TOO POLITE TO MAKE FURTHER OPPOSITION. HE EXCUSED
HIMSELF, HOWEVER, FROM ATTENDING THEM: "THE RAYS OF THE SUN WERE NOT TOO
CHEERFUL FOR HIM, AND HE WOULD MEET THEM BY ANOTHER COURSE." HE TURNED
AWAY; AND CATHERINE WAS SHOCKED TO FIND HOW MUCH HER SPIRITS WERE
RELIEVED BY THE SEPARATION. THE SHOCK, HOWEVER, BEING LESS REAL THAN THE
RELIEF, OFFERED IT NO INJURY; AND SHE BEGAN TO TALK WITH EASY GAIETY OF
THE DELIGHTFUL MELANCHOLY WHICH SUCH A GROVE INSPIRED.

"I AM PARTICULARLY FOND OF THIS SPOT," SAID HER COMPANION, WITH A SIGH.
"IT WAS MY MOTHER'S FAVOURITE WALK."

CATHERINE HAD NEVER HEARD MRS. TILNEY MENTIONED IN THE FAMILY BEFORE,
AND THE INTEREST EXCITED BY THIS TENDER REMEMBRANCE SHOWED ITSELF
DIRECTLY IN HER ALTERED COUNTENANCE, AND IN THE ATTENTIVE PAUSE WITH
WHICH SHE WAITED FOR SOMETHING MORE.

"I USED TO WALK HERE SO OFTEN WITH HER!" ADDED ELEANOR; "THOUGH I NEVER
LOVED IT THEN, AS I HAVE LOVED IT SINCE. AT THAT TIME INDEED I USED TO
WONDER AT HER CHOICE. BUT HER MEMORY ENDEARS IT NOW."

"AND OUGHT IT NOT," REFLECTED CATHERINE, "TO ENDEAR IT TO HER HUSBAND?
YET THE GENERAL WOULD NOT ENTER IT." MISS TILNEY CONTINUING SILENT, SHE
VENTURED TO SAY, "HER DEATH MUST HAVE BEEN A GREAT AFFLICTION!"

"A GREAT AND INCREASING ONE," REPLIED THE OTHER, IN A LOW VOICE. "I WAS
ONLY THIRTEEN WHEN IT HAPPENED; AND THOUGH I FELT MY LOSS PERHAPS AS
STRONGLY AS ONE SO YOUNG COULD FEEL IT, I DID NOT, I COULD NOT, THEN
KNOW WHAT A LOSS IT WAS." SHE STOPPED FOR A MOMENT, AND THEN ADDED, WITH
GREAT FIRMNESS, "I HAVE NO SISTER, YOU KNOW--AND THOUGH HENRY--THOUGH MY
BROTHERS ARE VERY AFFECTIONATE, AND HENRY IS A GREAT DEAL HERE, WHICH I
AM MOST THANKFUL FOR, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME NOT TO BE OFTEN SOLITARY."

"TO BE SURE YOU MUST MISS HIM VERY MUCH."

"A MOTHER WOULD HAVE BEEN ALWAYS PRESENT. A MOTHER WOULD HAVE BEEN A
CONSTANT FRIEND; HER INFLUENCE WOULD HAVE BEEN BEYOND ALL OTHER."

"WAS SHE A VERY CHARMING WOMAN? WAS SHE HANDSOME? WAS THERE ANY PICTURE
OF HER IN THE ABBEY? AND WHY HAD SHE BEEN SO PARTIAL TO THAT GROVE? WAS
IT FROM DEJECTION OF SPIRITS?"--WERE QUESTIONS NOW EAGERLY POURED FORTH;
THE FIRST THREE RECEIVED A READY AFFIRMATIVE, THE TWO OTHERS WERE PASSED
BY; AND CATHERINE'S INTEREST IN THE DECEASED MRS. TILNEY AUGMENTED WITH
EVERY QUESTION, WHETHER ANSWERED OR NOT. OF HER UNHAPPINESS IN MARRIAGE,
SHE FELT PERSUADED. THE GENERAL CERTAINLY HAD BEEN AN UNKIND HUSBAND. HE
DID NOT LOVE HER WALK: COULD HE THEREFORE HAVE LOVED HER? AND BESIDES,
HANDSOME AS HE WAS, THERE WAS A SOMETHING IN THE TURN OF HIS FEATURES
WHICH SPOKE HIS NOT HAVING BEHAVED WELL TO HER.

"HER PICTURE, I SUPPOSE," BLUSHING AT THE CONSUMMATE ART OF HER OWN
QUESTION, "HANGS IN YOUR FATHER'S ROOM?"

"NO; IT WAS INTENDED FOR THE DRAWING-ROOM; BUT MY FATHER WAS
DISSATISFIED WITH THE PAINTING, AND FOR SOME TIME IT HAD NO PLACE.
SOON AFTER HER DEATH I OBTAINED IT FOR MY OWN, AND HUNG IT IN MY
BED-CHAMBER--WHERE I SHALL BE HAPPY TO SHOW IT YOU; IT IS VERY LIKE."
HERE WAS ANOTHER PROOF. A PORTRAIT--VERY LIKE--OF A DEPARTED WIFE, NOT
VALUED BY THE HUSBAND! HE MUST HAVE BEEN DREADFULLY CRUEL TO HER!

CATHERINE ATTEMPTED NO LONGER TO HIDE FROM HERSELF THE NATURE OF THE
FEELINGS WHICH, IN SPITE OF ALL HIS ATTENTIONS, HE HAD PREVIOUSLY
EXCITED; AND WHAT HAD BEEN TERROR AND DISLIKE BEFORE, WAS NOW ABSOLUTE
AVERSION. YES, AVERSION! HIS CRUELTY TO SUCH A CHARMING WOMAN MADE HIM
ODIOUS TO HER. SHE HAD OFTEN READ OF SUCH CHARACTERS, CHARACTERS WHICH
MR. ALLEN HAD BEEN USED TO CALL UNNATURAL AND OVERDRAWN; BUT HERE WAS
PROOF POSITIVE OF THE CONTRARY.

SHE HAD JUST SETTLED THIS POINT WHEN THE END OF THE PATH BROUGHT THEM
DIRECTLY UPON THE GENERAL; AND IN SPITE OF ALL HER VIRTUOUS INDIGNATION,
SHE FOUND HERSELF AGAIN OBLIGED TO WALK WITH HIM, LISTEN TO HIM, AND
EVEN TO SMILE WHEN HE SMILED. BEING NO LONGER ABLE, HOWEVER, TO RECEIVE
PLEASURE FROM THE SURROUNDING OBJECTS, SHE SOON BEGAN TO WALK WITH
LASSITUDE; THE GENERAL PERCEIVED IT, AND WITH A CONCERN FOR HER HEALTH,
WHICH SEEMED TO REPROACH HER FOR HER OPINION OF HIM, WAS MOST URGENT
FOR RETURNING WITH HIS DAUGHTER TO THE HOUSE. HE WOULD FOLLOW THEM IN
A QUARTER OF AN HOUR. AGAIN THEY PARTED--BUT ELEANOR WAS CALLED BACK IN
HALF A MINUTE TO RECEIVE A STRICT CHARGE AGAINST TAKING HER FRIEND ROUND
THE ABBEY TILL HIS RETURN. THIS SECOND INSTANCE OF HIS ANXIETY TO DELAY
WHAT SHE SO MUCH WISHED FOR STRUCK CATHERINE AS VERY REMARKABLE.




CHAPTER 23


AN HOUR PASSED AWAY BEFORE THE GENERAL CAME IN, SPENT, ON THE PART OF
HIS YOUNG GUEST, IN NO VERY FAVOURABLE CONSIDERATION OF HIS CHARACTER.
"THIS LENGTHENED ABSENCE, THESE SOLITARY RAMBLES, DID NOT SPEAK A MIND
AT EASE, OR A CONSCIENCE VOID OF REPROACH." AT LENGTH HE APPEARED; AND,
WHATEVER MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE GLOOM OF HIS MEDITATIONS, HE COULD STILL
SMILE WITH THEM. MISS TILNEY, UNDERSTANDING IN PART HER FRIEND'S
CURIOSITY TO SEE THE HOUSE, SOON REVIVED THE SUBJECT; AND HER FATHER
BEING, CONTRARY TO CATHERINE'S EXPECTATIONS, UNPROVIDED WITH ANY
PRETENCE FOR FURTHER DELAY, BEYOND THAT OF STOPPING FIVE MINUTES TO
ORDER REFRESHMENTS TO BE IN THE ROOM BY THEIR RETURN, WAS AT LAST READY
TO ESCORT THEM.

THEY SET FORWARD; AND, WITH A GRANDEUR OF AIR, A DIGNIFIED STEP,
WHICH CAUGHT THE EYE, BUT COULD NOT SHAKE THE DOUBTS OF THE WELL-READ
CATHERINE, HE LED THE WAY ACROSS THE HALL, THROUGH THE COMMON
DRAWING-ROOM AND ONE USELESS ANTECHAMBER, INTO A ROOM MAGNIFICENT BOTH
IN SIZE AND FURNITURE--THE REAL DRAWING-ROOM, USED ONLY WITH COMPANY OF
CONSEQUENCE. IT WAS VERY NOBLE--VERY GRAND--VERY CHARMING!--WAS ALL THAT
CATHERINE HAD TO SAY, FOR HER INDISCRIMINATING EYE SCARCELY DISCERNED
THE COLOUR OF THE SATIN; AND ALL MINUTENESS OF PRAISE, ALL PRAISE
THAT HAD MUCH MEANING, WAS SUPPLIED BY THE GENERAL: THE COSTLINESS OR
ELEGANCE OF ANY ROOM'S FITTING-UP COULD BE NOTHING TO HER; SHE CARED FOR
NO FURNITURE OF A MORE MODERN DATE THAN THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY. WHEN THE
GENERAL HAD SATISFIED HIS OWN CURIOSITY, IN A CLOSE EXAMINATION OF EVERY
WELL-KNOWN ORNAMENT, THEY PROCEEDED INTO THE LIBRARY, AN APARTMENT, IN
ITS WAY, OF EQUAL MAGNIFICENCE, EXHIBITING A COLLECTION OF BOOKS, ON
WHICH AN HUMBLE MAN MIGHT HAVE LOOKED WITH PRIDE. CATHERINE HEARD,
ADMIRED, AND WONDERED WITH MORE GENUINE FEELING THAN BEFORE--GATHERED
ALL THAT SHE COULD FROM THIS STOREHOUSE OF KNOWLEDGE, BY RUNNING OVER
THE TITLES OF HALF A SHELF, AND WAS READY TO PROCEED. BUT SUITES OF
APARTMENTS DID NOT SPRING UP WITH HER WISHES. LARGE AS WAS THE BUILDING,
SHE HAD ALREADY VISITED THE GREATEST PART; THOUGH, ON BEING TOLD THAT,
WITH THE ADDITION OF THE KITCHEN, THE SIX OR SEVEN ROOMS SHE HAD NOW
SEEN SURROUNDED THREE SIDES OF THE COURT, SHE COULD SCARCELY BELIEVE IT,
OR OVERCOME THE SUSPICION OF THERE BEING MANY CHAMBERS SECRETED. IT WAS
SOME RELIEF, HOWEVER, THAT THEY WERE TO RETURN TO THE ROOMS IN COMMON
USE, BY PASSING THROUGH A FEW OF LESS IMPORTANCE, LOOKING INTO THE
COURT, WHICH, WITH OCCASIONAL PASSAGES, NOT WHOLLY UNINTRICATE,
CONNECTED THE DIFFERENT SIDES; AND SHE WAS FURTHER SOOTHED IN HER
PROGRESS BY BEING TOLD THAT SHE WAS TREADING WHAT HAD ONCE BEEN A
CLOISTER, HAVING TRACES OF CELLS POINTED OUT, AND OBSERVING SEVERAL
DOORS THAT WERE NEITHER OPENED NOR EXPLAINED TO HER--BY FINDING HERSELF
SUCCESSIVELY IN A BILLIARD-ROOM, AND IN THE GENERAL'S PRIVATE APARTMENT,
WITHOUT COMPREHENDING THEIR CONNECTION, OR BEING ABLE TO TURN ARIGHT
WHEN SHE LEFT THEM; AND LASTLY, BY PASSING THROUGH A DARK LITTLE ROOM,
OWNING HENRY'S AUTHORITY, AND STREWED WITH HIS LITTER OF BOOKS, GUNS,
AND GREATCOATS.

FROM THE DINING-ROOM, OF WHICH, THOUGH ALREADY SEEN, AND ALWAYS TO BE
SEEN AT FIVE O'CLOCK, THE GENERAL COULD NOT FORGO THE PLEASURE OF PACING
OUT THE LENGTH, FOR THE MORE CERTAIN INFORMATION OF MISS MORLAND, AS
TO WHAT SHE NEITHER DOUBTED NOR CARED FOR, THEY PROCEEDED BY QUICK
COMMUNICATION TO THE KITCHEN--THE ANCIENT KITCHEN OF THE CONVENT, RICH
IN THE MASSY WALLS AND SMOKE OF FORMER DAYS, AND IN THE STOVES AND HOT
CLOSETS OF THE PRESENT. THE GENERAL'S IMPROVING HAND HAD NOT LOITERED
HERE: EVERY MODERN INVENTION TO FACILITATE THE LABOUR OF THE COOKS HAD
BEEN ADOPTED WITHIN THIS, THEIR SPACIOUS THEATRE; AND, WHEN THE GENIUS
OF OTHERS HAD FAILED, HIS OWN HAD OFTEN PRODUCED THE PERFECTION WANTED.
HIS ENDOWMENTS OF THIS SPOT ALONE MIGHT AT ANY TIME HAVE PLACED HIM HIGH
AMONG THE BENEFACTORS OF THE CONVENT.

WITH THE WALLS OF THE KITCHEN ENDED ALL THE ANTIQUITY OF THE ABBEY; THE
FOURTH SIDE OF THE QUADRANGLE HAVING, ON ACCOUNT OF ITS DECAYING STATE,
BEEN REMOVED BY THE GENERAL'S FATHER, AND THE PRESENT ERECTED IN ITS
PLACE. ALL THAT WAS VENERABLE CEASED HERE. THE NEW BUILDING WAS NOT
ONLY NEW, BUT DECLARED ITSELF TO BE SO; INTENDED ONLY FOR OFFICES, AND
ENCLOSED BEHIND BY STABLE-YARDS, NO UNIFORMITY OF ARCHITECTURE HAD BEEN
THOUGHT NECESSARY. CATHERINE COULD HAVE RAVED AT THE HAND WHICH HAD
SWEPT AWAY WHAT MUST HAVE BEEN BEYOND THE VALUE OF ALL THE REST, FOR THE
PURPOSES OF MERE DOMESTIC ECONOMY; AND WOULD WILLINGLY HAVE BEEN SPARED
THE MORTIFICATION OF A WALK THROUGH SCENES SO FALLEN, HAD THE GENERAL
ALLOWED IT; BUT IF HE HAD A VANITY, IT WAS IN THE ARRANGEMENT OF HIS
OFFICES; AND AS HE WAS CONVINCED THAT, TO A MIND LIKE MISS MORLAND'S,
A VIEW OF THE ACCOMMODATIONS AND COMFORTS, BY WHICH THE LABOURS OF HER
INFERIORS WERE SOFTENED, MUST ALWAYS BE GRATIFYING, HE SHOULD MAKE
NO APOLOGY FOR LEADING HER ON. THEY TOOK A SLIGHT SURVEY OF ALL; AND
CATHERINE WAS IMPRESSED, BEYOND HER EXPECTATION, BY THEIR MULTIPLICITY
AND THEIR CONVENIENCE. THE PURPOSES FOR WHICH A FEW SHAPELESS PANTRIES
AND A COMFORTLESS SCULLERY WERE DEEMED SUFFICIENT AT FULLERTON, WERE
HERE CARRIED ON IN APPROPRIATE DIVISIONS, COMMODIOUS AND ROOMY. THE
NUMBER OF SERVANTS CONTINUALLY APPEARING DID NOT STRIKE HER LESS THAN
THE NUMBER OF THEIR OFFICES. WHEREVER THEY WENT, SOME PATTENED GIRL
STOPPED TO CURTSY, OR SOME FOOTMAN IN DISHABILLE SNEAKED OFF. YET THIS
WAS AN ABBEY! HOW INEXPRESSIBLY DIFFERENT IN THESE DOMESTIC ARRANGEMENTS
FROM SUCH AS SHE HAD READ ABOUT--FROM ABBEYS AND CASTLES, IN WHICH,
THOUGH CERTAINLY LARGER THAN NORTHANGER, ALL THE DIRTY WORK OF THE HOUSE
WAS TO BE DONE BY TWO PAIR OF FEMALE HANDS AT THE UTMOST. HOW THEY COULD
GET THROUGH IT ALL HAD OFTEN AMAZED MRS. ALLEN; AND, WHEN CATHERINE SAW
WHAT WAS NECESSARY HERE, SHE BEGAN TO BE AMAZED HERSELF.

THEY RETURNED TO THE HALL, THAT THE CHIEF STAIRCASE MIGHT BE ASCENDED,
AND THE BEAUTY OF ITS WOOD, AND ORNAMENTS OF RICH CARVING MIGHT BE
POINTED OUT: HAVING GAINED THE TOP, THEY TURNED IN AN OPPOSITE DIRECTION
FROM THE GALLERY IN WHICH HER ROOM LAY, AND SHORTLY ENTERED ONE ON
THE SAME PLAN, BUT SUPERIOR IN LENGTH AND BREADTH. SHE WAS HERE SHOWN
SUCCESSIVELY INTO THREE LARGE BED-CHAMBERS, WITH THEIR DRESSING-ROOMS,
MOST COMPLETELY AND HANDSOMELY FITTED UP; EVERYTHING THAT MONEY AND
TASTE COULD DO, TO GIVE COMFORT AND ELEGANCE TO APARTMENTS, HAD BEEN
BESTOWED ON THESE; AND, BEING FURNISHED WITHIN THE LAST FIVE YEARS, THEY
WERE PERFECT IN ALL THAT WOULD BE GENERALLY PLEASING, AND WANTING IN ALL
THAT COULD GIVE PLEASURE TO CATHERINE. AS THEY WERE SURVEYING THE LAST,
THE GENERAL, AFTER SLIGHTLY NAMING A FEW OF THE DISTINGUISHED CHARACTERS
BY WHOM THEY HAD AT TIMES BEEN HONOURED, TURNED WITH A SMILING
COUNTENANCE TO CATHERINE, AND VENTURED TO HOPE THAT HENCEFORWARD SOME OF
THEIR EARLIEST TENANTS MIGHT BE "OUR FRIENDS FROM FULLERTON." SHE FELT
THE UNEXPECTED COMPLIMENT, AND DEEPLY REGRETTED THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF
THINKING WELL OF A MAN SO KINDLY DISPOSED TOWARDS HERSELF, AND SO FULL
OF CIVILITY TO ALL HER FAMILY.

THE GALLERY WAS TERMINATED BY FOLDING DOORS, WHICH MISS TILNEY,
ADVANCING, HAD THROWN OPEN, AND PASSED THROUGH, AND SEEMED ON THE POINT
OF DOING THE SAME BY THE FIRST DOOR TO THE LEFT, IN ANOTHER LONG REACH
OF GALLERY, WHEN THE GENERAL, COMING FORWARDS, CALLED HER HASTILY, AND,
AS CATHERINE THOUGHT, RATHER ANGRILY BACK, DEMANDING WHETHER SHE WERE
GOING?--AND WHAT WAS THERE MORE TO BE SEEN?--HAD NOT MISS MORLAND
ALREADY SEEN ALL THAT COULD BE WORTH HER NOTICE?--AND DID SHE NOT
SUPPOSE HER FRIEND MIGHT BE GLAD OF SOME REFRESHMENT AFTER SO MUCH
EXERCISE? MISS TILNEY DREW BACK DIRECTLY, AND THE HEAVY DOORS WERE
CLOSED UPON THE MORTIFIED CATHERINE, WHO, HAVING SEEN, IN A MOMENTARY
GLANCE BEYOND THEM, A NARROWER PASSAGE, MORE NUMEROUS OPENINGS, AND
SYMPTOMS OF A WINDING STAIRCASE, BELIEVED HERSELF AT LAST WITHIN THE
REACH OF SOMETHING WORTH HER NOTICE; AND FELT, AS SHE UNWILLINGLY PACED
BACK THE GALLERY, THAT SHE WOULD RATHER BE ALLOWED TO EXAMINE THAT END
OF THE HOUSE THAN SEE ALL THE FINERY OF ALL THE REST. THE GENERAL'S
EVIDENT DESIRE OF PREVENTING SUCH AN EXAMINATION WAS AN ADDITIONAL
STIMULANT. SOMETHING WAS CERTAINLY TO BE CONCEALED; HER FANCY, THOUGH
IT HAD TRESPASSED LATELY ONCE OR TWICE, COULD NOT MISLEAD HER HERE;
AND WHAT THAT SOMETHING WAS, A SHORT SENTENCE OF MISS TILNEY'S, AS THEY
FOLLOWED THE GENERAL AT SOME DISTANCE DOWNSTAIRS, SEEMED TO POINT OUT:
"I WAS GOING TO TAKE YOU INTO WHAT WAS MY MOTHER'S ROOM--THE ROOM
IN WHICH SHE DIED--" WERE ALL HER WORDS; BUT FEW AS THEY WERE, THEY
CONVEYED PAGES OF INTELLIGENCE TO CATHERINE. IT WAS NO WONDER THAT THE
GENERAL SHOULD SHRINK FROM THE SIGHT OF SUCH OBJECTS AS THAT ROOM
MUST CONTAIN; A ROOM IN ALL PROBABILITY NEVER ENTERED BY HIM SINCE THE
DREADFUL SCENE HAD PASSED, WHICH RELEASED HIS SUFFERING WIFE, AND LEFT
HIM TO THE STINGS OF CONSCIENCE.

SHE VENTURED, WHEN NEXT ALONE WITH ELEANOR, TO EXPRESS HER WISH OF BEING
PERMITTED TO SEE IT, AS WELL AS ALL THE REST OF THAT SIDE OF THE HOUSE;
AND ELEANOR PROMISED TO ATTEND HER THERE, WHENEVER THEY SHOULD HAVE A
CONVENIENT HOUR. CATHERINE UNDERSTOOD HER: THE GENERAL MUST BE WATCHED
FROM HOME, BEFORE THAT ROOM COULD BE ENTERED. "IT REMAINS AS IT WAS, I
SUPPOSE?" SAID SHE, IN A TONE OF FEELING.

"YES, ENTIRELY."

"AND HOW LONG AGO MAY IT BE THAT YOUR MOTHER DIED?"

"SHE HAS BEEN DEAD THESE NINE YEARS." AND NINE YEARS, CATHERINE KNEW,
WAS A TRIFLE OF TIME, COMPARED WITH WHAT GENERALLY ELAPSED AFTER THE
DEATH OF AN INJURED WIFE, BEFORE HER ROOM WAS PUT TO RIGHTS.

"YOU WERE WITH HER, I SUPPOSE, TO THE LAST?"

"NO," SAID MISS TILNEY, SIGHING; "I WAS UNFORTUNATELY FROM HOME. HER
ILLNESS WAS SUDDEN AND SHORT; AND, BEFORE I ARRIVED IT WAS ALL OVER."

CATHERINE'S BLOOD RAN COLD WITH THE HORRID SUGGESTIONS WHICH NATURALLY
SPRANG FROM THESE WORDS. COULD IT BE POSSIBLE? COULD HENRY'S FATHER--?
AND YET HOW MANY WERE THE EXAMPLES TO JUSTIFY EVEN THE BLACKEST
SUSPICIONS! AND, WHEN SHE SAW HIM IN THE EVENING, WHILE SHE WORKED
WITH HER FRIEND, SLOWLY PACING THE DRAWING-ROOM FOR AN HOUR TOGETHER IN
SILENT THOUGHTFULNESS, WITH DOWNCAST EYES AND CONTRACTED BROW, SHE FELT
SECURE FROM ALL POSSIBILITY OF WRONGING HIM. IT WAS THE AIR AND ATTITUDE
OF A MONTONI! WHAT COULD MORE PLAINLY SPEAK THE GLOOMY WORKINGS OF A
MIND NOT WHOLLY DEAD TO EVERY SENSE OF HUMANITY, IN ITS FEARFUL REVIEW
OF PAST SCENES OF GUILT? UNHAPPY MAN! AND THE ANXIOUSNESS OF HER SPIRITS
DIRECTED HER EYES TOWARDS HIS FIGURE SO REPEATEDLY, AS TO CATCH MISS
TILNEY'S NOTICE. "MY FATHER," SHE WHISPERED, "OFTEN WALKS ABOUT THE ROOM
IN THIS WAY; IT IS NOTHING UNUSUAL."

"SO MUCH THE WORSE!" THOUGHT CATHERINE; SUCH ILL-TIMED EXERCISE WAS OF A
PIECE WITH THE STRANGE UNSEASONABLENESS OF HIS MORNING WALKS, AND BODED
NOTHING GOOD.

AFTER AN EVENING, THE LITTLE VARIETY AND SEEMING LENGTH OF WHICH MADE
HER PECULIARLY SENSIBLE OF HENRY'S IMPORTANCE AMONG THEM, SHE WAS
HEARTILY GLAD TO BE DISMISSED; THOUGH IT WAS A LOOK FROM THE GENERAL NOT
DESIGNED FOR HER OBSERVATION WHICH SENT HIS DAUGHTER TO THE BELL.
WHEN THE BUTLER WOULD HAVE LIT HIS MASTER'S CANDLE, HOWEVER, HE WAS
FORBIDDEN. THE LATTER WAS NOT GOING TO RETIRE. "I HAVE MANY PAMPHLETS TO
FINISH," SAID HE TO CATHERINE, "BEFORE I CAN CLOSE MY EYES, AND PERHAPS
MAY BE PORING OVER THE AFFAIRS OF THE NATION FOR HOURS AFTER YOU ARE
ASLEEP. CAN EITHER OF US BE MORE MEETLY EMPLOYED? MY EYES WILL BE
BLINDING FOR THE GOOD OF OTHERS, AND YOURS PREPARING BY REST FOR FUTURE
MISCHIEF."

BUT NEITHER THE BUSINESS ALLEGED, NOR THE MAGNIFICENT COMPLIMENT,
COULD WIN CATHERINE FROM THINKING THAT SOME VERY DIFFERENT OBJECT MUST
OCCASION SO SERIOUS A DELAY OF PROPER REPOSE. TO BE KEPT UP FOR HOURS,
AFTER THE FAMILY WERE IN BED, BY STUPID PAMPHLETS WAS NOT VERY LIKELY.
THERE MUST BE SOME DEEPER CAUSE: SOMETHING WAS TO BE DONE WHICH COULD
BE DONE ONLY WHILE THE HOUSEHOLD SLEPT; AND THE PROBABILITY THAT MRS.
TILNEY YET LIVED, SHUT UP FOR CAUSES UNKNOWN, AND RECEIVING FROM THE
PITILESS HANDS OF HER HUSBAND A NIGHTLY SUPPLY OF COARSE FOOD, WAS THE
CONCLUSION WHICH NECESSARILY FOLLOWED. SHOCKING AS WAS THE IDEA, IT
WAS AT LEAST BETTER THAN A DEATH UNFAIRLY HASTENED, AS, IN THE NATURAL
COURSE OF THINGS, SHE MUST ERE LONG BE RELEASED. THE SUDDENNESS OF HER
REPUTED ILLNESS, THE ABSENCE OF HER DAUGHTER, AND PROBABLY OF HER OTHER
CHILDREN, AT THE TIME--ALL FAVOURED THE SUPPOSITION OF HER IMPRISONMENT.
ITS ORIGIN--JEALOUSY PERHAPS, OR WANTON CRUELTY--WAS YET TO BE
UNRAVELLED.

IN REVOLVING THESE MATTERS, WHILE SHE UNDRESSED, IT SUDDENLY STRUCK HER
AS NOT UNLIKELY THAT SHE MIGHT THAT MORNING HAVE PASSED NEAR THE VERY
SPOT OF THIS UNFORTUNATE WOMAN'S CONFINEMENT--MIGHT HAVE BEEN WITHIN
A FEW PACES OF THE CELL IN WHICH SHE LANGUISHED OUT HER DAYS; FOR WHAT
PART OF THE ABBEY COULD BE MORE FITTED FOR THE PURPOSE THAN THAT WHICH
YET BORE THE TRACES OF MONASTIC DIVISION? IN THE HIGH-ARCHED PASSAGE,
PAVED WITH STONE, WHICH ALREADY SHE HAD TRODDEN WITH PECULIAR AWE, SHE
WELL REMEMBERED THE DOORS OF WHICH THE GENERAL HAD GIVEN NO ACCOUNT. TO
WHAT MIGHT NOT THOSE DOORS LEAD? IN SUPPORT OF THE PLAUSIBILITY OF THIS
CONJECTURE, IT FURTHER OCCURRED TO HER THAT THE FORBIDDEN GALLERY, IN
WHICH LAY THE APARTMENTS OF THE UNFORTUNATE MRS. TILNEY, MUST BE, AS
CERTAINLY AS HER MEMORY COULD GUIDE HER, EXACTLY OVER THIS SUSPECTED
RANGE OF CELLS, AND THE STAIRCASE BY THE SIDE OF THOSE APARTMENTS OF
WHICH SHE HAD CAUGHT A TRANSIENT GLIMPSE, COMMUNICATING BY SOME
SECRET MEANS WITH THOSE CELLS, MIGHT WELL HAVE FAVOURED THE BARBAROUS
PROCEEDINGS OF HER HUSBAND. DOWN THAT STAIRCASE SHE HAD PERHAPS BEEN
CONVEYED IN A STATE OF WELL-PREPARED INSENSIBILITY!

CATHERINE SOMETIMES STARTED AT THE BOLDNESS OF HER OWN SURMISES, AND
SOMETIMES HOPED OR FEARED THAT SHE HAD GONE TOO FAR; BUT THEY WERE
SUPPORTED BY SUCH APPEARANCES AS MADE THEIR DISMISSAL IMPOSSIBLE.

THE SIDE OF THE QUADRANGLE, IN WHICH SHE SUPPOSED THE GUILTY SCENE TO BE
ACTING, BEING, ACCORDING TO HER BELIEF, JUST OPPOSITE HER OWN, IT STRUCK
HER THAT, IF JUDICIOUSLY WATCHED, SOME RAYS OF LIGHT FROM THE GENERAL'S
LAMP MIGHT GLIMMER THROUGH THE LOWER WINDOWS, AS HE PASSED TO THE PRISON
OF HIS WIFE; AND, TWICE BEFORE SHE STEPPED INTO BED, SHE STOLE GENTLY
FROM HER ROOM TO THE CORRESPONDING WINDOW IN THE GALLERY, TO SEE IF IT
APPEARED; BUT ALL ABROAD WAS DARK, AND IT MUST YET BE TOO EARLY. THE
VARIOUS ASCENDING NOISES CONVINCED HER THAT THE SERVANTS MUST STILL BE
UP. TILL MIDNIGHT, SHE SUPPOSED IT WOULD BE IN VAIN TO WATCH; BUT THEN,
WHEN THE CLOCK HAD STRUCK TWELVE, AND ALL WAS QUIET, SHE WOULD, IF NOT
QUITE APPALLED BY DARKNESS, STEAL OUT AND LOOK ONCE MORE. THE CLOCK
STRUCK TWELVE--AND CATHERINE HAD BEEN HALF AN HOUR ASLEEP.




CHAPTER 24


THE NEXT DAY AFFORDED NO OPPORTUNITY FOR THE PROPOSED EXAMINATION OF THE
MYSTERIOUS APARTMENTS. IT WAS SUNDAY, AND THE WHOLE TIME BETWEEN MORNING
AND AFTERNOON SERVICE WAS REQUIRED BY THE GENERAL IN EXERCISE ABROAD OR
EATING COLD MEAT AT HOME; AND GREAT AS WAS CATHERINE'S CURIOSITY, HER
COURAGE WAS NOT EQUAL TO A WISH OF EXPLORING THEM AFTER DINNER, EITHER
BY THE FADING LIGHT OF THE SKY BETWEEN SIX AND SEVEN O'CLOCK, OR BY THE
YET MORE PARTIAL THOUGH STRONGER ILLUMINATION OF A TREACHEROUS LAMP.
THE DAY WAS UNMARKED THEREFORE BY ANYTHING TO INTEREST HER IMAGINATION
BEYOND THE SIGHT OF A VERY ELEGANT MONUMENT TO THE MEMORY OF MRS.
TILNEY, WHICH IMMEDIATELY FRONTED THE FAMILY PEW. BY THAT HER EYE
WAS INSTANTLY CAUGHT AND LONG RETAINED; AND THE PERUSAL OF THE HIGHLY
STRAINED EPITAPH, IN WHICH EVERY VIRTUE WAS ASCRIBED TO HER BY THE
INCONSOLABLE HUSBAND, WHO MUST HAVE BEEN IN SOME WAY OR OTHER HER
DESTROYER, AFFECTED HER EVEN TO TEARS.

THAT THE GENERAL, HAVING ERECTED SUCH A MONUMENT, SHOULD BE ABLE TO FACE
IT, WAS NOT PERHAPS VERY STRANGE, AND YET THAT HE COULD SIT SO BOLDLY
COLLECTED WITHIN ITS VIEW, MAINTAIN SO ELEVATED AN AIR, LOOK SO
FEARLESSLY AROUND, NAY, THAT HE SHOULD EVEN ENTER THE CHURCH, SEEMED
WONDERFUL TO CATHERINE. NOT, HOWEVER, THAT MANY INSTANCES OF BEINGS
EQUALLY HARDENED IN GUILT MIGHT NOT BE PRODUCED. SHE COULD REMEMBER
DOZENS WHO HAD PERSEVERED IN EVERY POSSIBLE VICE, GOING ON FROM CRIME TO
CRIME, MURDERING WHOMSOEVER THEY CHOSE, WITHOUT ANY FEELING OF HUMANITY
OR REMORSE; TILL A VIOLENT DEATH OR A RELIGIOUS RETIREMENT CLOSED THEIR
BLACK CAREER. THE ERECTION OF THE MONUMENT ITSELF COULD NOT IN THE
SMALLEST DEGREE AFFECT HER DOUBTS OF MRS. TILNEY'S ACTUAL DECEASE. WERE
SHE EVEN TO DESCEND INTO THE FAMILY VAULT WHERE HER ASHES WERE SUPPOSED
TO SLUMBER, WERE SHE TO BEHOLD THE COFFIN IN WHICH THEY WERE SAID TO
BE ENCLOSED--WHAT COULD IT AVAIL IN SUCH A CASE? CATHERINE HAD READ TOO
MUCH NOT TO BE PERFECTLY AWARE OF THE EASE WITH WHICH A WAXEN FIGURE
MIGHT BE INTRODUCED, AND A SUPPOSITITIOUS FUNERAL CARRIED ON.

THE SUCCEEDING MORNING PROMISED SOMETHING BETTER. THE GENERAL'S EARLY
WALK, ILL-TIMED AS IT WAS IN EVERY OTHER VIEW, WAS FAVOURABLE HERE; AND
WHEN SHE KNEW HIM TO BE OUT OF THE HOUSE, SHE DIRECTLY PROPOSED TO MISS
TILNEY THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF HER PROMISE. ELEANOR WAS READY TO OBLIGE
HER; AND CATHERINE REMINDING HER AS THEY WENT OF ANOTHER PROMISE, THEIR
FIRST VISIT IN CONSEQUENCE WAS TO THE PORTRAIT IN HER BED-CHAMBER. IT
REPRESENTED A VERY LOVELY WOMAN, WITH A MILD AND PENSIVE COUNTENANCE,
JUSTIFYING, SO FAR, THE EXPECTATIONS OF ITS NEW OBSERVER; BUT THEY WERE
NOT IN EVERY RESPECT ANSWERED, FOR CATHERINE HAD DEPENDED UPON MEETING
WITH FEATURES, HAIR, COMPLEXION, THAT SHOULD BE THE VERY COUNTERPART,
THE VERY IMAGE, IF NOT OF HENRY'S, OF ELEANOR'S--THE ONLY PORTRAITS OF
WHICH SHE HAD BEEN IN THE HABIT OF THINKING, BEARING ALWAYS AN EQUAL
RESEMBLANCE OF MOTHER AND CHILD. A FACE ONCE TAKEN WAS TAKEN FOR
GENERATIONS. BUT HERE SHE WAS OBLIGED TO LOOK AND CONSIDER AND STUDY
FOR A LIKENESS. SHE CONTEMPLATED IT, HOWEVER, IN SPITE OF THIS DRAWBACK,
WITH MUCH EMOTION, AND, BUT FOR A YET STRONGER INTEREST, WOULD HAVE LEFT
IT UNWILLINGLY.

HER AGITATION AS THEY ENTERED THE GREAT GALLERY WAS TOO MUCH FOR ANY
ENDEAVOUR AT DISCOURSE; SHE COULD ONLY LOOK AT HER COMPANION. ELEANOR'S
COUNTENANCE WAS DEJECTED, YET SEDATE; AND ITS COMPOSURE SPOKE HER INURED
TO ALL THE GLOOMY OBJECTS TO WHICH THEY WERE ADVANCING. AGAIN SHE PASSED
THROUGH THE FOLDING DOORS, AGAIN HER HAND WAS UPON THE IMPORTANT LOCK,
AND CATHERINE, HARDLY ABLE TO BREATHE, WAS TURNING TO CLOSE THE FORMER
WITH FEARFUL CAUTION, WHEN THE FIGURE, THE DREADED FIGURE OF THE GENERAL
HIMSELF AT THE FURTHER END OF THE GALLERY, STOOD BEFORE HER! THE NAME OF
"ELEANOR" AT THE SAME MOMENT, IN HIS LOUDEST TONE, RESOUNDED THROUGH THE
BUILDING, GIVING TO HIS DAUGHTER THE FIRST INTIMATION OF HIS PRESENCE,
AND TO CATHERINE TERROR UPON TERROR. AN ATTEMPT AT CONCEALMENT HAD BEEN
HER FIRST INSTINCTIVE MOVEMENT ON PERCEIVING HIM, YET SHE COULD
SCARCELY HOPE TO HAVE ESCAPED HIS EYE; AND WHEN HER FRIEND, WHO WITH AN
APOLOGIZING LOOK DARTED HASTILY BY HER, HAD JOINED AND DISAPPEARED
WITH HIM, SHE RAN FOR SAFETY TO HER OWN ROOM, AND, LOCKING HERSELF
IN, BELIEVED THAT SHE SHOULD NEVER HAVE COURAGE TO GO DOWN AGAIN. SHE
REMAINED THERE AT LEAST AN HOUR, IN THE GREATEST AGITATION, DEEPLY
COMMISERATING THE STATE OF HER POOR FRIEND, AND EXPECTING A SUMMONS
HERSELF FROM THE ANGRY GENERAL TO ATTEND HIM IN HIS OWN APARTMENT. NO
SUMMONS, HOWEVER, ARRIVED; AND AT LAST, ON SEEING A CARRIAGE DRIVE UP
TO THE ABBEY, SHE WAS EMBOLDENED TO DESCEND AND MEET HIM UNDER THE
PROTECTION OF VISITORS. THE BREAKFAST-ROOM WAS GAY WITH COMPANY; AND
SHE WAS NAMED TO THEM BY THE GENERAL AS THE FRIEND OF HIS DAUGHTER, IN
A COMPLIMENTARY STYLE, WHICH SO WELL CONCEALED HIS RESENTFUL IRE, AS TO
MAKE HER FEEL SECURE AT LEAST OF LIFE FOR THE PRESENT. AND ELEANOR,
WITH A COMMAND OF COUNTENANCE WHICH DID HONOUR TO HER CONCERN FOR HIS
CHARACTER, TAKING AN EARLY OCCASION OF SAYING TO HER, "MY FATHER ONLY
WANTED ME TO ANSWER A NOTE," SHE BEGAN TO HOPE THAT SHE HAD EITHER BEEN
UNSEEN BY THE GENERAL, OR THAT FROM SOME CONSIDERATION OF POLICY SHE
SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO SUPPOSE HERSELF SO. UPON THIS TRUST SHE DARED STILL
TO REMAIN IN HIS PRESENCE, AFTER THE COMPANY LEFT THEM, AND NOTHING
OCCURRED TO DISTURB IT.

IN THE COURSE OF THIS MORNING'S REFLECTIONS, SHE CAME TO A RESOLUTION
OF MAKING HER NEXT ATTEMPT ON THE FORBIDDEN DOOR ALONE. IT WOULD BE MUCH
BETTER IN EVERY RESPECT THAT ELEANOR SHOULD KNOW NOTHING OF THE MATTER.
TO INVOLVE HER IN THE DANGER OF A SECOND DETECTION, TO COURT HER INTO
AN APARTMENT WHICH MUST WRING HER HEART, COULD NOT BE THE OFFICE OF A
FRIEND. THE GENERAL'S UTMOST ANGER COULD NOT BE TO HERSELF WHAT IT MIGHT
BE TO A DAUGHTER; AND, BESIDES, SHE THOUGHT THE EXAMINATION ITSELF
WOULD BE MORE SATISFACTORY IF MADE WITHOUT ANY COMPANION. IT WOULD BE
IMPOSSIBLE TO EXPLAIN TO ELEANOR THE SUSPICIONS, FROM WHICH THE OTHER
HAD, IN ALL LIKELIHOOD, BEEN HITHERTO HAPPILY EXEMPT; NOR COULD SHE
THEREFORE, IN HER PRESENCE, SEARCH FOR THOSE PROOFS OF THE GENERAL'S
CRUELTY, WHICH HOWEVER THEY MIGHT YET HAVE ESCAPED DISCOVERY, SHE FELT
CONFIDENT OF SOMEWHERE DRAWING FORTH, IN THE SHAPE OF SOME FRAGMENTED
JOURNAL, CONTINUED TO THE LAST GASP. OF THE WAY TO THE APARTMENT SHE WAS
NOW PERFECTLY MISTRESS; AND AS SHE WISHED TO GET IT OVER BEFORE HENRY'S
RETURN, WHO WAS EXPECTED ON THE MORROW, THERE WAS NO TIME TO BE LOST.
THE DAY WAS BRIGHT, HER COURAGE HIGH; AT FOUR O'CLOCK, THE SUN WAS NOW
TWO HOURS ABOVE THE HORIZON, AND IT WOULD BE ONLY HER RETIRING TO DRESS
HALF AN HOUR EARLIER THAN USUAL.

IT WAS DONE; AND CATHERINE FOUND HERSELF ALONE IN THE GALLERY BEFORE THE
CLOCKS HAD CEASED TO STRIKE. IT WAS NO TIME FOR THOUGHT; SHE HURRIED
ON, SLIPPED WITH THE LEAST POSSIBLE NOISE THROUGH THE FOLDING DOORS,
AND WITHOUT STOPPING TO LOOK OR BREATHE, RUSHED FORWARD TO THE ONE IN
QUESTION. THE LOCK YIELDED TO HER HAND, AND, LUCKILY, WITH NO SULLEN
SOUND THAT COULD ALARM A HUMAN BEING. ON TIPTOE SHE ENTERED; THE ROOM
WAS BEFORE HER; BUT IT WAS SOME MINUTES BEFORE SHE COULD ADVANCE ANOTHER
STEP. SHE BEHELD WHAT FIXED HER TO THE SPOT AND AGITATED EVERY FEATURE.
SHE SAW A LARGE, WELL-PROPORTIONED APARTMENT, AN HANDSOME DIMITY BED,
ARRANGED AS UNOCCUPIED WITH AN HOUSEMAID'S CARE, A BRIGHT BATH STOVE,
MAHOGANY WARDROBES, AND NEATLY PAINTED CHAIRS, ON WHICH THE WARM BEAMS
OF A WESTERN SUN GAILY POURED THROUGH TWO SASH WINDOWS! CATHERINE HAD
EXPECTED TO HAVE HER FEELINGS WORKED, AND WORKED THEY WERE. ASTONISHMENT
AND DOUBT FIRST SEIZED THEM; AND A SHORTLY SUCCEEDING RAY OF COMMON
SENSE ADDED SOME BITTER EMOTIONS OF SHAME. SHE COULD NOT BE MISTAKEN
AS TO THE ROOM; BUT HOW GROSSLY MISTAKEN IN EVERYTHING ELSE!--IN MISS
TILNEY'S MEANING, IN HER OWN CALCULATION! THIS APARTMENT, TO WHICH SHE
HAD GIVEN A DATE SO ANCIENT, A POSITION SO AWFUL, PROVED TO BE ONE END
OF WHAT THE GENERAL'S FATHER HAD BUILT. THERE WERE TWO OTHER DOORS IN
THE CHAMBER, LEADING PROBABLY INTO DRESSING-CLOSETS; BUT SHE HAD NO
INCLINATION TO OPEN EITHER. WOULD THE VEIL IN WHICH MRS. TILNEY HAD LAST
WALKED, OR THE VOLUME IN WHICH SHE HAD LAST READ, REMAIN TO TELL WHAT
NOTHING ELSE WAS ALLOWED TO WHISPER? NO: WHATEVER MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE
GENERAL'S CRIMES, HE HAD CERTAINLY TOO MUCH WIT TO LET THEM SUE FOR
DETECTION. SHE WAS SICK OF EXPLORING, AND DESIRED BUT TO BE SAFE IN HER
OWN ROOM, WITH HER OWN HEART ONLY PRIVY TO ITS FOLLY; AND SHE WAS ON
THE POINT OF RETREATING AS SOFTLY AS SHE HAD ENTERED, WHEN THE SOUND OF
FOOTSTEPS, SHE COULD HARDLY TELL WHERE, MADE HER PAUSE AND TREMBLE.
TO BE FOUND THERE, EVEN BY A SERVANT, WOULD BE UNPLEASANT; BUT BY THE
GENERAL (AND HE SEEMED ALWAYS AT HAND WHEN LEAST WANTED), MUCH WORSE!
SHE LISTENED--THE SOUND HAD CEASED; AND RESOLVING NOT TO LOSE A
MOMENT, SHE PASSED THROUGH AND CLOSED THE DOOR. AT THAT INSTANT A DOOR
UNDERNEATH WAS HASTILY OPENED; SOMEONE SEEMED WITH SWIFT STEPS TO ASCEND
THE STAIRS, BY THE HEAD OF WHICH SHE HAD YET TO PASS BEFORE SHE COULD
GAIN THE GALLERY. SHE HAD NO POWER TO MOVE. WITH A FEELING OF TERROR
NOT VERY DEFINABLE, SHE FIXED HER EYES ON THE STAIRCASE, AND IN A FEW
MOMENTS IT GAVE HENRY TO HER VIEW. "MR. TILNEY!" SHE EXCLAIMED IN A
VOICE OF MORE THAN COMMON ASTONISHMENT. HE LOOKED ASTONISHED TOO. "GOOD
GOD!" SHE CONTINUED, NOT ATTENDING TO HIS ADDRESS. "HOW CAME YOU HERE?
HOW CAME YOU UP THAT STAIRCASE?"

"HOW CAME I UP THAT STAIRCASE!" HE REPLIED, GREATLY SURPRISED. "BECAUSE
IT IS MY NEAREST WAY FROM THE STABLE-YARD TO MY OWN CHAMBER; AND WHY
SHOULD I NOT COME UP IT?"

CATHERINE RECOLLECTED HERSELF, BLUSHED DEEPLY, AND COULD SAY NO MORE. HE
SEEMED TO BE LOOKING IN HER COUNTENANCE FOR THAT EXPLANATION WHICH HER
LIPS DID NOT AFFORD. SHE MOVED ON TOWARDS THE GALLERY. "AND MAY I NOT,
IN MY TURN," SAID HE, AS HE PUSHED BACK THE FOLDING DOORS, "ASK HOW YOU
CAME HERE? THIS PASSAGE IS AT LEAST AS EXTRAORDINARY A ROAD FROM THE
BREAKFAST-PARLOUR TO YOUR APARTMENT, AS THAT STAIRCASE CAN BE FROM THE
STABLES TO MINE."

"I HAVE BEEN," SAID CATHERINE, LOOKING DOWN, "TO SEE YOUR MOTHER'S
ROOM."

"MY MOTHER'S ROOM! IS THERE ANYTHING EXTRAORDINARY TO BE SEEN THERE?"

"NO, NOTHING AT ALL. I THOUGHT YOU DID NOT MEAN TO COME BACK TILL
TOMORROW."

"I DID NOT EXPECT TO BE ABLE TO RETURN SOONER, WHEN I WENT AWAY; BUT
THREE HOURS AGO I HAD THE PLEASURE OF FINDING NOTHING TO DETAIN ME. YOU
LOOK PALE. I AM AFRAID I ALARMED YOU BY RUNNING SO FAST UP THOSE STAIRS.
PERHAPS YOU DID NOT KNOW--YOU WERE NOT AWARE OF THEIR LEADING FROM THE
OFFICES IN COMMON USE?"

"NO, I WAS NOT. YOU HAVE HAD A VERY FINE DAY FOR YOUR RIDE."

"VERY; AND DOES ELEANOR LEAVE YOU TO FIND YOUR WAY INTO ALL THE ROOMS IN
THE HOUSE BY YOURSELF?"

"OH! NO; SHE SHOWED ME OVER THE GREATEST PART ON SATURDAY--AND WE WERE
COMING HERE TO THESE ROOMS--BUT ONLY"--DROPPING HER VOICE--"YOUR FATHER
WAS WITH US."

"AND THAT PREVENTED YOU," SAID HENRY, EARNESTLY REGARDING HER. "HAVE YOU
LOOKED INTO ALL THE ROOMS IN THAT PASSAGE?"

"NO, I ONLY WANTED TO SEE--IS NOT IT VERY LATE? I MUST GO AND DRESS."

"IT IS ONLY A QUARTER PAST FOUR" SHOWING HIS WATCH--"AND YOU ARE NOT NOW
IN BATH. NO THEATRE, NO ROOMS TO PREPARE FOR. HALF AN HOUR AT NORTHANGER
MUST BE ENOUGH."

SHE COULD NOT CONTRADICT IT, AND THEREFORE SUFFERED HERSELF TO BE
DETAINED, THOUGH HER DREAD OF FURTHER QUESTIONS MADE HER, FOR THE FIRST
TIME IN THEIR ACQUAINTANCE, WISH TO LEAVE HIM. THEY WALKED SLOWLY UP THE
GALLERY. "HAVE YOU HAD ANY LETTER FROM BATH SINCE I SAW YOU?"

"NO, AND I AM VERY MUCH SURPRISED. ISABELLA PROMISED SO FAITHFULLY TO
WRITE DIRECTLY."

"PROMISED SO FAITHFULLY! A FAITHFUL PROMISE! THAT PUZZLES ME. I HAVE
HEARD OF A FAITHFUL PERFORMANCE. BUT A FAITHFUL PROMISE--THE FIDELITY
OF PROMISING! IT IS A POWER LITTLE WORTH KNOWING, HOWEVER, SINCE IT CAN
DECEIVE AND PAIN YOU. MY MOTHER'S ROOM IS VERY COMMODIOUS, IS IT NOT?
LARGE AND CHEERFUL-LOOKING, AND THE DRESSING-CLOSETS SO WELL DISPOSED!
IT ALWAYS STRIKES ME AS THE MOST COMFORTABLE APARTMENT IN THE HOUSE, AND
I RATHER WONDER THAT ELEANOR SHOULD NOT TAKE IT FOR HER OWN. SHE SENT
YOU TO LOOK AT IT, I SUPPOSE?"

"NO."

"IT HAS BEEN YOUR OWN DOING ENTIRELY?" CATHERINE SAID NOTHING. AFTER A
SHORT SILENCE, DURING WHICH HE HAD CLOSELY OBSERVED HER, HE ADDED, "AS
THERE IS NOTHING IN THE ROOM IN ITSELF TO RAISE CURIOSITY, THIS MUST
HAVE PROCEEDED FROM A SENTIMENT OF RESPECT FOR MY MOTHER'S CHARACTER,
AS DESCRIBED BY ELEANOR, WHICH DOES HONOUR TO HER MEMORY. THE WORLD, I
BELIEVE, NEVER SAW A BETTER WOMAN. BUT IT IS NOT OFTEN THAT VIRTUE CAN
BOAST AN INTEREST SUCH AS THIS. THE DOMESTIC, UNPRETENDING MERITS OF A
PERSON NEVER KNOWN DO NOT OFTEN CREATE THAT KIND OF FERVENT, VENERATING
TENDERNESS WHICH WOULD PROMPT A VISIT LIKE YOURS. ELEANOR, I SUPPOSE,
HAS TALKED OF HER A GREAT DEAL?"

"YES, A GREAT DEAL. THAT IS--NO, NOT MUCH, BUT WHAT SHE DID SAY WAS VERY
INTERESTING. HER DYING SO SUDDENLY" (SLOWLY, AND WITH HESITATION IT
WAS SPOKEN), "AND YOU--NONE OF YOU BEING AT HOME--AND YOUR FATHER, I
THOUGHT--PERHAPS HAD NOT BEEN VERY FOND OF HER."

"AND FROM THESE CIRCUMSTANCES," HE REPLIED (HIS QUICK EYE
FIXED ON HERS), "YOU INFER PERHAPS THE PROBABILITY OF SOME
NEGLIGENCE--SOME"--(INVOLUNTARILY SHE SHOOK HER HEAD)--"OR IT MAY BE--OF
SOMETHING STILL LESS PARDONABLE." SHE RAISED HER EYES TOWARDS HIM
MORE FULLY THAN SHE HAD EVER DONE BEFORE. "MY MOTHER'S ILLNESS," HE
CONTINUED, "THE SEIZURE WHICH ENDED IN HER DEATH, WAS SUDDEN. THE MALADY
ITSELF, ONE FROM WHICH SHE HAD OFTEN SUFFERED, A BILIOUS FEVER--ITS
CAUSE THEREFORE CONSTITUTIONAL. ON THE THIRD DAY, IN SHORT, AS SOON AS
SHE COULD BE PREVAILED ON, A PHYSICIAN ATTENDED HER, A VERY RESPECTABLE
MAN, AND ONE IN WHOM SHE HAD ALWAYS PLACED GREAT CONFIDENCE. UPON HIS
OPINION OF HER DANGER, TWO OTHERS WERE CALLED IN THE NEXT DAY, AND
REMAINED IN ALMOST CONSTANT ATTENDANCE FOR FOUR AND TWENTY HOURS. ON THE
FIFTH DAY SHE DIED. DURING THE PROGRESS OF HER DISORDER, FREDERICK AND I
(WE WERE BOTH AT HOME) SAW HER REPEATEDLY; AND FROM OUR OWN OBSERVATION
CAN BEAR WITNESS TO HER HAVING RECEIVED EVERY POSSIBLE ATTENTION
WHICH COULD SPRING FROM THE AFFECTION OF THOSE ABOUT HER, OR WHICH HER
SITUATION IN LIFE COULD COMMAND. POOR ELEANOR WAS ABSENT, AND AT SUCH A
DISTANCE AS TO RETURN ONLY TO SEE HER MOTHER IN HER COFFIN."

"BUT YOUR FATHER," SAID CATHERINE, "WAS HE AFFLICTED?"

"FOR A TIME, GREATLY SO. YOU HAVE ERRED IN SUPPOSING HIM NOT ATTACHED
TO HER. HE LOVED HER, I AM PERSUADED, AS WELL AS IT WAS POSSIBLE FOR HIM
TO--WE HAVE NOT ALL, YOU KNOW, THE SAME TENDERNESS OF DISPOSITION--AND
I WILL NOT PRETEND TO SAY THAT WHILE SHE LIVED, SHE MIGHT NOT OFTEN HAVE
HAD MUCH TO BEAR, BUT THOUGH HIS TEMPER INJURED HER, HIS JUDGMENT NEVER
DID. HIS VALUE OF HER WAS SINCERE; AND, IF NOT PERMANENTLY, HE WAS TRULY
AFFLICTED BY HER DEATH."

"I AM VERY GLAD OF IT," SAID CATHERINE; "IT WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY
SHOCKING!"

"IF I UNDERSTAND YOU RIGHTLY, YOU HAD FORMED A SURMISE OF SUCH HORROR AS
I HAVE HARDLY WORDS TO--DEAR MISS MORLAND, CONSIDER THE DREADFUL NATURE
OF THE SUSPICIONS YOU HAVE ENTERTAINED. WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN JUDGING FROM?
REMEMBER THE COUNTRY AND THE AGE IN WHICH WE LIVE. REMEMBER THAT WE ARE
ENGLISH, THAT WE ARE CHRISTIANS. CONSULT YOUR OWN UNDERSTANDING, YOUR
OWN SENSE OF THE PROBABLE, YOUR OWN OBSERVATION OF WHAT IS PASSING
AROUND YOU. DOES OUR EDUCATION PREPARE US FOR SUCH ATROCITIES? DO OUR
LAWS CONNIVE AT THEM? COULD THEY BE PERPETRATED WITHOUT BEING KNOWN, IN
A COUNTRY LIKE THIS, WHERE SOCIAL AND LITERARY INTERCOURSE IS ON SUCH A
FOOTING, WHERE EVERY MAN IS SURROUNDED BY A NEIGHBOURHOOD OF VOLUNTARY
SPIES, AND WHERE ROADS AND NEWSPAPERS LAY EVERYTHING OPEN? DEAREST MISS
MORLAND, WHAT IDEAS HAVE YOU BEEN ADMITTING?"

THEY HAD REACHED THE END OF THE GALLERY, AND WITH TEARS OF SHAME SHE RAN
OFF TO HER OWN ROOM.




CHAPTER 25


THE VISIONS OF ROMANCE WERE OVER. CATHERINE WAS COMPLETELY AWAKENED.
HENRY'S ADDRESS, SHORT AS IT HAD BEEN, HAD MORE THOROUGHLY OPENED HER
EYES TO THE EXTRAVAGANCE OF HER LATE FANCIES THAN ALL THEIR SEVERAL
DISAPPOINTMENTS HAD DONE. MOST GRIEVOUSLY WAS SHE HUMBLED. MOST BITTERLY
DID SHE CRY. IT WAS NOT ONLY WITH HERSELF THAT SHE WAS SUNK--BUT WITH
HENRY. HER FOLLY, WHICH NOW SEEMED EVEN CRIMINAL, WAS ALL EXPOSED TO
HIM, AND HE MUST DESPISE HER FOREVER. THE LIBERTY WHICH HER IMAGINATION
HAD DARED TO TAKE WITH THE CHARACTER OF HIS FATHER--COULD HE EVER
FORGIVE IT? THE ABSURDITY OF HER CURIOSITY AND HER FEARS--COULD THEY
EVER BE FORGOTTEN? SHE HATED HERSELF MORE THAN SHE COULD EXPRESS. HE
HAD--SHE THOUGHT HE HAD, ONCE OR TWICE BEFORE THIS FATAL MORNING, SHOWN
SOMETHING LIKE AFFECTION FOR HER. BUT NOW--IN SHORT, SHE MADE HERSELF AS
MISERABLE AS POSSIBLE FOR ABOUT HALF AN HOUR, WENT DOWN WHEN THE
CLOCK STRUCK FIVE, WITH A BROKEN HEART, AND COULD SCARCELY GIVE AN
INTELLIGIBLE ANSWER TO ELEANOR'S INQUIRY IF SHE WAS WELL. THE FORMIDABLE
HENRY SOON FOLLOWED HER INTO THE ROOM, AND THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IN HIS
BEHAVIOUR TO HER WAS THAT HE PAID HER RATHER MORE ATTENTION THAN USUAL.
CATHERINE HAD NEVER WANTED COMFORT MORE, AND HE LOOKED AS IF HE WAS
AWARE OF IT.

THE EVENING WORE AWAY WITH NO ABATEMENT OF THIS SOOTHING POLITENESS; AND
HER SPIRITS WERE GRADUALLY RAISED TO A MODEST TRANQUILLITY. SHE DID NOT
LEARN EITHER TO FORGET OR DEFEND THE PAST; BUT SHE LEARNED TO HOPE THAT
IT WOULD NEVER TRANSPIRE FARTHER, AND THAT IT MIGHT NOT COST HER HENRY'S
ENTIRE REGARD. HER THOUGHTS BEING STILL CHIEFLY FIXED ON WHAT SHE HAD
WITH SUCH CAUSELESS TERROR FELT AND DONE, NOTHING COULD SHORTLY BE
CLEARER THAN THAT IT HAD BEEN ALL A VOLUNTARY, SELF-CREATED DELUSION,
EACH TRIFLING CIRCUMSTANCE RECEIVING IMPORTANCE FROM AN IMAGINATION
RESOLVED ON ALARM, AND EVERYTHING FORCED TO BEND TO ONE PURPOSE BY
A MIND WHICH, BEFORE SHE ENTERED THE ABBEY, HAD BEEN CRAVING TO BE
FRIGHTENED. SHE REMEMBERED WITH WHAT FEELINGS SHE HAD PREPARED FOR A
KNOWLEDGE OF NORTHANGER. SHE SAW THAT THE INFATUATION HAD BEEN CREATED,
THE MISCHIEF SETTLED, LONG BEFORE HER QUITTING BATH, AND IT SEEMED AS IF
THE WHOLE MIGHT BE TRACED TO THE INFLUENCE OF THAT SORT OF READING WHICH
SHE HAD THERE INDULGED.

CHARMING AS WERE ALL MRS. RADCLIFFE'S WORKS, AND CHARMING EVEN AS WERE
THE WORKS OF ALL HER IMITATORS, IT WAS NOT IN THEM PERHAPS THAT HUMAN
NATURE, AT LEAST IN THE MIDLAND COUNTIES OF ENGLAND, WAS TO BE LOOKED
FOR. OF THE ALPS AND PYRENEES, WITH THEIR PINE FORESTS AND THEIR VICES,
THEY MIGHT GIVE A FAITHFUL DELINEATION; AND ITALY, SWITZERLAND, AND
THE SOUTH OF FRANCE MIGHT BE AS FRUITFUL IN HORRORS AS THEY WERE THERE
REPRESENTED. CATHERINE DARED NOT DOUBT BEYOND HER OWN COUNTRY, AND EVEN
OF THAT, IF HARD PRESSED, WOULD HAVE YIELDED THE NORTHERN AND WESTERN
EXTREMITIES. BUT IN THE CENTRAL PART OF ENGLAND THERE WAS SURELY SOME
SECURITY FOR THE EXISTENCE EVEN OF A WIFE NOT BELOVED, IN THE LAWS OF
THE LAND, AND THE MANNERS OF THE AGE. MURDER WAS NOT TOLERATED, SERVANTS
WERE NOT SLAVES, AND NEITHER POISON NOR SLEEPING POTIONS TO BE PROCURED,
LIKE RHUBARB, FROM EVERY DRUGGIST. AMONG THE ALPS AND PYRENEES, PERHAPS,
THERE WERE NO MIXED CHARACTERS. THERE, SUCH AS WERE NOT AS SPOTLESS AS
AN ANGEL MIGHT HAVE THE DISPOSITIONS OF A FIEND. BUT IN ENGLAND IT WAS
NOT SO; AMONG THE ENGLISH, SHE BELIEVED, IN THEIR HEARTS AND HABITS,
THERE WAS A GENERAL THOUGH UNEQUAL MIXTURE OF GOOD AND BAD. UPON THIS
CONVICTION, SHE WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF EVEN IN HENRY AND ELEANOR
TILNEY, SOME SLIGHT IMPERFECTION MIGHT HEREAFTER APPEAR; AND UPON THIS
CONVICTION SHE NEED NOT FEAR TO ACKNOWLEDGE SOME ACTUAL SPECKS IN
THE CHARACTER OF THEIR FATHER, WHO, THOUGH CLEARED FROM THE GROSSLY
INJURIOUS SUSPICIONS WHICH SHE MUST EVER BLUSH TO HAVE ENTERTAINED, SHE
DID BELIEVE, UPON SERIOUS CONSIDERATION, TO BE NOT PERFECTLY AMIABLE.

HER MIND MADE UP ON THESE SEVERAL POINTS, AND HER RESOLUTION FORMED, OF
ALWAYS JUDGING AND ACTING IN FUTURE WITH THE GREATEST GOOD SENSE, SHE
HAD NOTHING TO DO BUT TO FORGIVE HERSELF AND BE HAPPIER THAN EVER; AND
THE LENIENT HAND OF TIME DID MUCH FOR HER BY INSENSIBLE GRADATIONS IN
THE COURSE OF ANOTHER DAY. HENRY'S ASTONISHING GENEROSITY AND NOBLENESS
OF CONDUCT, IN NEVER ALLUDING IN THE SLIGHTEST WAY TO WHAT HAD PASSED,
WAS OF THE GREATEST ASSISTANCE TO HER; AND SOONER THAN SHE COULD HAVE
SUPPOSED IT POSSIBLE IN THE BEGINNING OF HER DISTRESS, HER SPIRITS
BECAME ABSOLUTELY COMFORTABLE, AND CAPABLE, AS HERETOFORE, OF CONTINUAL
IMPROVEMENT BY ANYTHING HE SAID. THERE WERE STILL SOME SUBJECTS, INDEED,
UNDER WHICH SHE BELIEVED THEY MUST ALWAYS TREMBLE--THE MENTION OF A
CHEST OR A CABINET, FOR INSTANCE--AND SHE DID NOT LOVE THE SIGHT OF
JAPAN IN ANY SHAPE: BUT EVEN SHE COULD ALLOW THAT AN OCCASIONAL MEMENTO
OF PAST FOLLY, HOWEVER PAINFUL, MIGHT NOT BE WITHOUT USE.

THE ANXIETIES OF COMMON LIFE BEGAN SOON TO SUCCEED TO THE ALARMS OF
ROMANCE. HER DESIRE OF HEARING FROM ISABELLA GREW EVERY DAY GREATER.
SHE WAS QUITE IMPATIENT TO KNOW HOW THE BATH WORLD WENT ON, AND HOW THE
ROOMS WERE ATTENDED; AND ESPECIALLY WAS SHE ANXIOUS TO BE ASSURED OF
ISABELLA'S HAVING MATCHED SOME FINE NETTING-COTTON, ON WHICH SHE HAD
LEFT HER INTENT; AND OF HER CONTINUING ON THE BEST TERMS WITH JAMES. HER
ONLY DEPENDENCE FOR INFORMATION OF ANY KIND WAS ON ISABELLA. JAMES HAD
PROTESTED AGAINST WRITING TO HER TILL HIS RETURN TO OXFORD; AND MRS.
ALLEN HAD GIVEN HER NO HOPES OF A LETTER TILL SHE HAD GOT BACK TO
FULLERTON. BUT ISABELLA HAD PROMISED AND PROMISED AGAIN; AND WHEN SHE
PROMISED A THING, SHE WAS SO SCRUPULOUS IN PERFORMING IT! THIS MADE IT
SO PARTICULARLY STRANGE!

FOR NINE SUCCESSIVE MORNINGS, CATHERINE WONDERED OVER THE REPETITION
OF A DISAPPOINTMENT, WHICH EACH MORNING BECAME MORE SEVERE: BUT, ON
THE TENTH, WHEN SHE ENTERED THE BREAKFAST-ROOM, HER FIRST OBJECT WAS A
LETTER, HELD OUT BY HENRY'S WILLING HAND. SHE THANKED HIM AS HEARTILY
AS IF HE HAD WRITTEN IT HIMSELF. "'TIS ONLY FROM JAMES, HOWEVER," AS SHE
LOOKED AT THE DIRECTION. SHE OPENED IT; IT WAS FROM OXFORD; AND TO THIS
PURPOSE:


"DEAR CATHERINE,

"THOUGH, GOD KNOWS, WITH LITTLE INCLINATION FOR WRITING, I THINK IT MY
DUTY TO TELL YOU THAT EVERYTHING IS AT AN END BETWEEN MISS THORPE AND
ME. I LEFT HER AND BATH YESTERDAY, NEVER TO SEE EITHER AGAIN. I SHALL
NOT ENTER INTO PARTICULARS--THEY WOULD ONLY PAIN YOU MORE. YOU WILL SOON
HEAR ENOUGH FROM ANOTHER QUARTER TO KNOW WHERE LIES THE BLAME; AND I
HOPE WILL ACQUIT YOUR BROTHER OF EVERYTHING BUT THE FOLLY OF TOO EASILY
THINKING HIS AFFECTION RETURNED. THANK GOD! I AM UNDECEIVED IN TIME!
BUT IT IS A HEAVY BLOW! AFTER MY FATHER'S CONSENT HAD BEEN SO KINDLY
GIVEN--BUT NO MORE OF THIS. SHE HAS MADE ME MISERABLE FOREVER! LET ME
SOON HEAR FROM YOU, DEAR CATHERINE; YOU ARE MY ONLY FRIEND; YOUR LOVE
I DO BUILD UPON. I WISH YOUR VISIT AT NORTHANGER MAY BE OVER BEFORE
CAPTAIN TILNEY MAKES HIS ENGAGEMENT KNOWN, OR YOU WILL BE UNCOMFORTABLY
CIRCUMSTANCED. POOR THORPE IS IN TOWN: I DREAD THE SIGHT OF HIM; HIS
HONEST HEART WOULD FEEL SO MUCH. I HAVE WRITTEN TO HIM AND MY FATHER.
HER DUPLICITY HURTS ME MORE THAN ALL; TILL THE VERY LAST, IF I REASONED
WITH HER, SHE DECLARED HERSELF AS MUCH ATTACHED TO ME AS EVER, AND
LAUGHED AT MY FEARS. I AM ASHAMED TO THINK HOW LONG I BORE WITH IT;
BUT IF EVER MAN HAD REASON TO BELIEVE HIMSELF LOVED, I WAS THAT MAN. I
CANNOT UNDERSTAND EVEN NOW WHAT SHE WOULD BE AT, FOR THERE COULD BE NO
NEED OF MY BEING PLAYED OFF TO MAKE HER SECURE OF TILNEY. WE PARTED
AT LAST BY MUTUAL CONSENT--HAPPY FOR ME HAD WE NEVER MET! I CAN NEVER
EXPECT TO KNOW SUCH ANOTHER WOMAN! DEAREST CATHERINE, BEWARE HOW YOU
GIVE YOUR HEART.

"BELIEVE ME," ETC.


CATHERINE HAD NOT READ THREE LINES BEFORE HER SUDDEN CHANGE OF
COUNTENANCE, AND SHORT EXCLAMATIONS OF SORROWING WONDER, DECLARED HER TO
BE RECEIVING UNPLEASANT NEWS; AND HENRY, EARNESTLY WATCHING HER THROUGH
THE WHOLE LETTER, SAW PLAINLY THAT IT ENDED NO BETTER THAN IT BEGAN. HE
WAS PREVENTED, HOWEVER, FROM EVEN LOOKING HIS SURPRISE BY HIS FATHER'S
ENTRANCE. THEY WENT TO BREAKFAST DIRECTLY; BUT CATHERINE COULD HARDLY
EAT ANYTHING. TEARS FILLED HER EYES, AND EVEN RAN DOWN HER CHEEKS AS SHE
SAT. THE LETTER WAS ONE MOMENT IN HER HAND, THEN IN HER LAP, AND THEN IN
HER POCKET; AND SHE LOOKED AS IF SHE KNEW NOT WHAT SHE DID. THE GENERAL,
BETWEEN HIS COCOA AND HIS NEWSPAPER, HAD LUCKILY NO LEISURE FOR NOTICING
HER; BUT TO THE OTHER TWO HER DISTRESS WAS EQUALLY VISIBLE. AS SOON
AS SHE DARED LEAVE THE TABLE SHE HURRIED AWAY TO HER OWN ROOM; BUT THE
HOUSEMAIDS WERE BUSY IN IT, AND SHE WAS OBLIGED TO COME DOWN AGAIN.
SHE TURNED INTO THE DRAWING-ROOM FOR PRIVACY, BUT HENRY AND ELEANOR HAD
LIKEWISE RETREATED THITHER, AND WERE AT THAT MOMENT DEEP IN CONSULTATION
ABOUT HER. SHE DREW BACK, TRYING TO BEG THEIR PARDON, BUT WAS, WITH
GENTLE VIOLENCE, FORCED TO RETURN; AND THE OTHERS WITHDREW, AFTER
ELEANOR HAD AFFECTIONATELY EXPRESSED A WISH OF BEING OF USE OR COMFORT
TO HER.

AFTER HALF AN HOUR'S FREE INDULGENCE OF GRIEF AND REFLECTION, CATHERINE
FELT EQUAL TO ENCOUNTERING HER FRIENDS; BUT WHETHER SHE SHOULD MAKE
HER DISTRESS KNOWN TO THEM WAS ANOTHER CONSIDERATION. PERHAPS, IF
PARTICULARLY QUESTIONED, SHE MIGHT JUST GIVE AN IDEA--JUST DISTANTLY
HINT AT IT--BUT NOT MORE. TO EXPOSE A FRIEND, SUCH A FRIEND AS ISABELLA
HAD BEEN TO HER--AND THEN THEIR OWN BROTHER SO CLOSELY CONCERNED IN IT!
SHE BELIEVED SHE MUST WAIVE THE SUBJECT ALTOGETHER. HENRY AND ELEANOR
WERE BY THEMSELVES IN THE BREAKFAST-ROOM; AND EACH, AS SHE ENTERED IT,
LOOKED AT HER ANXIOUSLY. CATHERINE TOOK HER PLACE AT THE TABLE, AND,
AFTER A SHORT SILENCE, ELEANOR SAID, "NO BAD NEWS FROM FULLERTON, I
HOPE? MR. AND MRS. MORLAND--YOUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS--I HOPE THEY ARE
NONE OF THEM ILL?"

"NO, I THANK YOU" (SIGHING AS SHE SPOKE); "THEY ARE ALL VERY WELL. MY
LETTER WAS FROM MY BROTHER AT OXFORD."

NOTHING FURTHER WAS SAID FOR A FEW MINUTES; AND THEN SPEAKING THROUGH
HER TEARS, SHE ADDED, "I DO NOT THINK I SHALL EVER WISH FOR A LETTER
AGAIN!"

"I AM SORRY," SAID HENRY, CLOSING THE BOOK HE HAD JUST OPENED; "IF I
HAD SUSPECTED THE LETTER OF CONTAINING ANYTHING UNWELCOME, I SHOULD HAVE
GIVEN IT WITH VERY DIFFERENT FEELINGS."

"IT CONTAINED SOMETHING WORSE THAN ANYBODY COULD SUPPOSE! POOR JAMES IS
SO UNHAPPY! YOU WILL SOON KNOW WHY."

"TO HAVE SO KIND-HEARTED, SO AFFECTIONATE A SISTER," REPLIED HENRY
WARMLY, "MUST BE A COMFORT TO HIM UNDER ANY DISTRESS."

"I HAVE ONE FAVOUR TO BEG," SAID CATHERINE, SHORTLY AFTERWARDS, IN AN
AGITATED MANNER, "THAT, IF YOUR BROTHER SHOULD BE COMING HERE, YOU WILL
GIVE ME NOTICE OF IT, THAT I MAY GO AWAY."

"OUR BROTHER! FREDERICK!"

"YES; I AM SURE I SHOULD BE VERY SORRY TO LEAVE YOU SO SOON, BUT
SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED THAT WOULD MAKE IT VERY DREADFUL FOR ME TO BE IN
THE SAME HOUSE WITH CAPTAIN TILNEY."

ELEANOR'S WORK WAS SUSPENDED WHILE SHE GAZED WITH INCREASING
ASTONISHMENT; BUT HENRY BEGAN TO SUSPECT THE TRUTH, AND SOMETHING, IN
WHICH MISS THORPE'S NAME WAS INCLUDED, PASSED HIS LIPS.

"HOW QUICK YOU ARE!" CRIED CATHERINE: "YOU HAVE GUESSED IT, I DECLARE!
AND YET, WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT IT IN BATH, YOU LITTLE THOUGHT OF ITS
ENDING SO. ISABELLA--NO WONDER NOW I HAVE NOT HEARD FROM HER--ISABELLA
HAS DESERTED MY BROTHER, AND IS TO MARRY YOURS! COULD YOU HAVE BELIEVED
THERE HAD BEEN SUCH INCONSTANCY AND FICKLENESS, AND EVERYTHING THAT IS
BAD IN THE WORLD?"

"I HOPE, SO FAR AS CONCERNS MY BROTHER, YOU ARE MISINFORMED. I HOPE
HE HAS NOT HAD ANY MATERIAL SHARE IN BRINGING ON MR. MORLAND'S
DISAPPOINTMENT. HIS MARRYING MISS THORPE IS NOT PROBABLE. I THINK YOU
MUST BE DECEIVED SO FAR. I AM VERY SORRY FOR MR. MORLAND--SORRY THAT
ANYONE YOU LOVE SHOULD BE UNHAPPY; BUT MY SURPRISE WOULD BE GREATER AT
FREDERICK'S MARRYING HER THAN AT ANY OTHER PART OF THE STORY."

"IT IS VERY TRUE, HOWEVER; YOU SHALL READ JAMES'S LETTER YOURSELF.
STAY--THERE IS ONE PART--" RECOLLECTING WITH A BLUSH THE LAST LINE.

"WILL YOU TAKE THE TROUBLE OF READING TO US THE PASSAGES WHICH CONCERN
MY BROTHER?"

"NO, READ IT YOURSELF," CRIED CATHERINE, WHOSE SECOND THOUGHTS WERE
CLEARER. "I DO NOT KNOW WHAT I WAS THINKING OF" (BLUSHING AGAIN THAT SHE
HAD BLUSHED BEFORE); "JAMES ONLY MEANS TO GIVE ME GOOD ADVICE."

HE GLADLY RECEIVED THE LETTER, AND, HAVING READ IT THROUGH, WITH CLOSE
ATTENTION, RETURNED IT SAYING, "WELL, IF IT IS TO BE SO, I CAN ONLY
SAY THAT I AM SORRY FOR IT. FREDERICK WILL NOT BE THE FIRST MAN WHO HAS
CHOSEN A WIFE WITH LESS SENSE THAN HIS FAMILY EXPECTED. I DO NOT ENVY
HIS SITUATION, EITHER AS A LOVER OR A SON."

MISS TILNEY, AT CATHERINE'S INVITATION, NOW READ THE LETTER LIKEWISE,
AND, HAVING EXPRESSED ALSO HER CONCERN AND SURPRISE, BEGAN TO INQUIRE
INTO MISS THORPE'S CONNECTIONS AND FORTUNE.

"HER MOTHER IS A VERY GOOD SORT OF WOMAN," WAS CATHERINE'S ANSWER.

"WHAT WAS HER FATHER?"

"A LAWYER, I BELIEVE. THEY LIVE AT PUTNEY."

"ARE THEY A WEALTHY FAMILY?"

"NO, NOT VERY. I DO NOT BELIEVE ISABELLA HAS ANY FORTUNE AT ALL: BUT
THAT WILL NOT SIGNIFY IN YOUR FAMILY. YOUR FATHER IS SO VERY LIBERAL!
HE TOLD ME THE OTHER DAY THAT HE ONLY VALUED MONEY AS IT ALLOWED HIM TO
PROMOTE THE HAPPINESS OF HIS CHILDREN." THE BROTHER AND SISTER LOOKED
AT EACH OTHER. "BUT," SAID ELEANOR, AFTER A SHORT PAUSE, "WOULD IT BE TO
PROMOTE HIS HAPPINESS, TO ENABLE HIM TO MARRY SUCH A GIRL? SHE MUST BE
AN UNPRINCIPLED ONE, OR SHE COULD NOT HAVE USED YOUR BROTHER SO. AND HOW
STRANGE AN INFATUATION ON FREDERICK'S SIDE! A GIRL WHO, BEFORE HIS EYES,
IS VIOLATING AN ENGAGEMENT VOLUNTARILY ENTERED INTO WITH ANOTHER MAN! IS
NOT IT INCONCEIVABLE, HENRY? FREDERICK TOO, WHO ALWAYS WORE HIS HEART SO
PROUDLY! WHO FOUND NO WOMAN GOOD ENOUGH TO BE LOVED!"

"THAT IS THE MOST UNPROMISING CIRCUMSTANCE, THE STRONGEST PRESUMPTION
AGAINST HIM. WHEN I THINK OF HIS PAST DECLARATIONS, I GIVE HIM UP.
MOREOVER, I HAVE TOO GOOD AN OPINION OF MISS THORPE'S PRUDENCE TO
SUPPOSE THAT SHE WOULD PART WITH ONE GENTLEMAN BEFORE THE OTHER
WAS SECURED. IT IS ALL OVER WITH FREDERICK INDEED! HE IS A DECEASED
MAN--DEFUNCT IN UNDERSTANDING. PREPARE FOR YOUR SISTER-IN-LAW, ELEANOR,
AND SUCH A SISTER-IN-LAW AS YOU MUST DELIGHT IN! OPEN, CANDID, ARTLESS,
GUILELESS, WITH AFFECTIONS STRONG BUT SIMPLE, FORMING NO PRETENSIONS,
AND KNOWING NO DISGUISE."

"SUCH A SISTER-IN-LAW, HENRY, I SHOULD DELIGHT IN," SAID ELEANOR WITH A
SMILE.

"BUT PERHAPS," OBSERVED CATHERINE, "THOUGH SHE HAS BEHAVED SO ILL BY OUR
FAMILY, SHE MAY BEHAVE BETTER BY YOURS. NOW SHE HAS REALLY GOT THE MAN
SHE LIKES, SHE MAY BE CONSTANT."

"INDEED I AM AFRAID SHE WILL," REPLIED HENRY; "I AM AFRAID SHE WILL
BE VERY CONSTANT, UNLESS A BARONET SHOULD COME IN HER WAY; THAT IS
FREDERICK'S ONLY CHANCE. I WILL GET THE BATH PAPER, AND LOOK OVER THE
ARRIVALS."

"YOU THINK IT IS ALL FOR AMBITION, THEN? AND, UPON MY WORD, THERE ARE
SOME THINGS THAT SEEM VERY LIKE IT. I CANNOT FORGET THAT, WHEN SHE FIRST
KNEW WHAT MY FATHER WOULD DO FOR THEM, SHE SEEMED QUITE DISAPPOINTED
THAT IT WAS NOT MORE. I NEVER WAS SO DECEIVED IN ANYONE'S CHARACTER IN
MY LIFE BEFORE."

"AMONG ALL THE GREAT VARIETY THAT YOU HAVE KNOWN AND STUDIED."

"MY OWN DISAPPOINTMENT AND LOSS IN HER IS VERY GREAT; BUT, AS FOR POOR
JAMES, I SUPPOSE HE WILL HARDLY EVER RECOVER IT."

"YOUR BROTHER IS CERTAINLY VERY MUCH TO BE PITIED AT PRESENT; BUT WE
MUST NOT, IN OUR CONCERN FOR HIS SUFFERINGS, UNDERVALUE YOURS. YOU FEEL,
I SUPPOSE, THAT IN LOSING ISABELLA, YOU LOSE HALF YOURSELF: YOU FEEL A
VOID IN YOUR HEART WHICH NOTHING ELSE CAN OCCUPY. SOCIETY IS BECOMING
IRKSOME; AND AS FOR THE AMUSEMENTS IN WHICH YOU WERE WONT TO SHARE AT
BATH, THE VERY IDEA OF THEM WITHOUT HER IS ABHORRENT. YOU WOULD NOT,
FOR INSTANCE, NOW GO TO A BALL FOR THE WORLD. YOU FEEL THAT YOU HAVE NO
LONGER ANY FRIEND TO WHOM YOU CAN SPEAK WITH UNRESERVE, ON WHOSE REGARD
YOU CAN PLACE DEPENDENCE, OR WHOSE COUNSEL, IN ANY DIFFICULTY, YOU COULD
RELY ON. YOU FEEL ALL THIS?"

"NO," SAID CATHERINE, AFTER A FEW MOMENTS' REFLECTION, "I DO NOT--OUGHT
I? TO SAY THE TRUTH, THOUGH I AM HURT AND GRIEVED, THAT I CANNOT STILL
LOVE HER, THAT I AM NEVER TO HEAR FROM HER, PERHAPS NEVER TO SEE HER
AGAIN, I DO NOT FEEL SO VERY, VERY MUCH AFFLICTED AS ONE WOULD HAVE
THOUGHT."

"YOU FEEL, AS YOU ALWAYS DO, WHAT IS MOST TO THE CREDIT OF HUMAN NATURE.
SUCH FEELINGS OUGHT TO BE INVESTIGATED, THAT THEY MAY KNOW THEMSELVES."

CATHERINE, BY SOME CHANCE OR OTHER, FOUND HER SPIRITS SO VERY MUCH
RELIEVED BY THIS CONVERSATION THAT SHE COULD NOT REGRET HER BEING LED
ON, THOUGH SO UNACCOUNTABLY, TO MENTION THE CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH HAD
PRODUCED IT.




CHAPTER 26


FROM THIS TIME, THE SUBJECT WAS FREQUENTLY CANVASSED BY THE THREE YOUNG
PEOPLE; AND CATHERINE FOUND, WITH SOME SURPRISE, THAT HER TWO YOUNG
FRIENDS WERE PERFECTLY AGREED IN CONSIDERING ISABELLA'S WANT OF
CONSEQUENCE AND FORTUNE AS LIKELY TO THROW GREAT DIFFICULTIES IN THE WAY
OF HER MARRYING THEIR BROTHER. THEIR PERSUASION THAT THE GENERAL WOULD,
UPON THIS GROUND ALONE, INDEPENDENT OF THE OBJECTION THAT MIGHT BE
RAISED AGAINST HER CHARACTER, OPPOSE THE CONNECTION, TURNED HER FEELINGS
MOREOVER WITH SOME ALARM TOWARDS HERSELF. SHE WAS AS INSIGNIFICANT,
AND PERHAPS AS PORTIONLESS, AS ISABELLA; AND IF THE HEIR OF THE TILNEY
PROPERTY HAD NOT GRANDEUR AND WEALTH ENOUGH IN HIMSELF, AT WHAT POINT
OF INTEREST WERE THE DEMANDS OF HIS YOUNGER BROTHER TO REST? THE VERY
PAINFUL REFLECTIONS TO WHICH THIS THOUGHT LED COULD ONLY BE DISPERSED BY
A DEPENDENCE ON THE EFFECT OF THAT PARTICULAR PARTIALITY, WHICH, AS SHE
WAS GIVEN TO UNDERSTAND BY HIS WORDS AS WELL AS HIS ACTIONS, SHE HAD
FROM THE FIRST BEEN SO FORTUNATE AS TO EXCITE IN THE GENERAL; AND BY A
RECOLLECTION OF SOME MOST GENEROUS AND DISINTERESTED SENTIMENTS ON THE
SUBJECT OF MONEY, WHICH SHE HAD MORE THAN ONCE HEARD HIM UTTER, AND
WHICH TEMPTED HER TO THINK HIS DISPOSITION IN SUCH MATTERS MISUNDERSTOOD
BY HIS CHILDREN.

THEY WERE SO FULLY CONVINCED, HOWEVER, THAT THEIR BROTHER WOULD NOT
HAVE THE COURAGE TO APPLY IN PERSON FOR HIS FATHER'S CONSENT, AND SO
REPEATEDLY ASSURED HER THAT HE HAD NEVER IN HIS LIFE BEEN LESS LIKELY TO
COME TO NORTHANGER THAN AT THE PRESENT TIME, THAT SHE SUFFERED HER MIND
TO BE AT EASE AS TO THE NECESSITY OF ANY SUDDEN REMOVAL OF HER OWN. BUT
AS IT WAS NOT TO BE SUPPOSED THAT CAPTAIN TILNEY, WHENEVER HE MADE HIS
APPLICATION, WOULD GIVE HIS FATHER ANY JUST IDEA OF ISABELLA'S CONDUCT,
IT OCCURRED TO HER AS HIGHLY EXPEDIENT THAT HENRY SHOULD LAY THE WHOLE
BUSINESS BEFORE HIM AS IT REALLY WAS, ENABLING THE GENERAL BY THAT MEANS
TO FORM A COOL AND IMPARTIAL OPINION, AND PREPARE HIS OBJECTIONS ON
A FAIRER GROUND THAN INEQUALITY OF SITUATIONS. SHE PROPOSED IT TO HIM
ACCORDINGLY; BUT HE DID NOT CATCH AT THE MEASURE SO EAGERLY AS SHE HAD
EXPECTED. "NO," SAID HE, "MY FATHER'S HANDS NEED NOT BE STRENGTHENED,
AND FREDERICK'S CONFESSION OF FOLLY NEED NOT BE FORESTALLED. HE MUST
TELL HIS OWN STORY."

"BUT HE WILL TELL ONLY HALF OF IT."

"A QUARTER WOULD BE ENOUGH."

A DAY OR TWO PASSED AWAY AND BROUGHT NO TIDINGS OF CAPTAIN TILNEY. HIS
BROTHER AND SISTER KNEW NOT WHAT TO THINK. SOMETIMES IT APPEARED TO
THEM AS IF HIS SILENCE WOULD BE THE NATURAL RESULT OF THE SUSPECTED
ENGAGEMENT, AND AT OTHERS THAT IT WAS WHOLLY INCOMPATIBLE WITH IT.
THE GENERAL, MEANWHILE, THOUGH OFFENDED EVERY MORNING BY FREDERICK'S
REMISSNESS IN WRITING, WAS FREE FROM ANY REAL ANXIETY ABOUT HIM, AND HAD
NO MORE PRESSING SOLICITUDE THAN THAT OF MAKING MISS MORLAND'S TIME AT
NORTHANGER PASS PLEASANTLY. HE OFTEN EXPRESSED HIS UNEASINESS ON THIS
HEAD, FEARED THE SAMENESS OF EVERY DAY'S SOCIETY AND EMPLOYMENTS WOULD
DISGUST HER WITH THE PLACE, WISHED THE LADY FRASERS HAD BEEN IN THE
COUNTRY, TALKED EVERY NOW AND THEN OF HAVING A LARGE PARTY TO DINNER,
AND ONCE OR TWICE BEGAN EVEN TO CALCULATE THE NUMBER OF YOUNG DANCING
PEOPLE IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD. BUT THEN IT WAS SUCH A DEAD TIME OF YEAR,
NO WILD-FOWL, NO GAME, AND THE LADY FRASERS WERE NOT IN THE COUNTRY.
AND IT ALL ENDED, AT LAST, IN HIS TELLING HENRY ONE MORNING THAT WHEN HE
NEXT WENT TO WOODSTON, THEY WOULD TAKE HIM BY SURPRISE THERE SOME DAY
OR OTHER, AND EAT THEIR MUTTON WITH HIM. HENRY WAS GREATLY HONOURED AND
VERY HAPPY, AND CATHERINE WAS QUITE DELIGHTED WITH THE SCHEME. "AND WHEN
DO YOU THINK, SIR, I MAY LOOK FORWARD TO THIS PLEASURE? I MUST BE AT
WOODSTON ON MONDAY TO ATTEND THE PARISH MEETING, AND SHALL PROBABLY BE
OBLIGED TO STAY TWO OR THREE DAYS."

"WELL, WELL, WE WILL TAKE OUR CHANCE SOME ONE OF THOSE DAYS. THERE IS
NO NEED TO FIX. YOU ARE NOT TO PUT YOURSELF AT ALL OUT OF YOUR WAY.
WHATEVER YOU MAY HAPPEN TO HAVE IN THE HOUSE WILL BE ENOUGH. I THINK I
CAN ANSWER FOR THE YOUNG LADIES MAKING ALLOWANCE FOR A BACHELOR'S TABLE.
LET ME SEE; MONDAY WILL BE A BUSY DAY WITH YOU, WE WILL NOT COME ON
MONDAY; AND TUESDAY WILL BE A BUSY ONE WITH ME. I EXPECT MY SURVEYOR
FROM BROCKHAM WITH HIS REPORT IN THE MORNING; AND AFTERWARDS I CANNOT IN
DECENCY FAIL ATTENDING THE CLUB. I REALLY COULD NOT FACE MY ACQUAINTANCE
IF I STAYED AWAY NOW; FOR, AS I AM KNOWN TO BE IN THE COUNTRY, IT WOULD
BE TAKEN EXCEEDINGLY AMISS; AND IT IS A RULE WITH ME, MISS MORLAND,
NEVER TO GIVE OFFENCE TO ANY OF MY NEIGHBOURS, IF A SMALL SACRIFICE OF
TIME AND ATTENTION CAN PREVENT IT. THEY ARE A SET OF VERY WORTHY MEN.
THEY HAVE HALF A BUCK FROM NORTHANGER TWICE A YEAR; AND I DINE WITH THEM
WHENEVER I CAN. TUESDAY, THEREFORE, WE MAY SAY IS OUT OF THE QUESTION.
BUT ON WEDNESDAY, I THINK, HENRY, YOU MAY EXPECT US; AND WE SHALL BE
WITH YOU EARLY, THAT WE MAY HAVE TIME TO LOOK ABOUT US. TWO HOURS AND
THREE QUARTERS WILL CARRY US TO WOODSTON, I SUPPOSE; WE SHALL BE IN THE
CARRIAGE BY TEN; SO, ABOUT A QUARTER BEFORE ONE ON WEDNESDAY, YOU MAY
LOOK FOR US."

A BALL ITSELF COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE WELCOME TO CATHERINE THAN
THIS LITTLE EXCURSION, SO STRONG WAS HER DESIRE TO BE ACQUAINTED WITH
WOODSTON; AND HER HEART WAS STILL BOUNDING WITH JOY WHEN HENRY, ABOUT AN
HOUR AFTERWARDS, CAME BOOTED AND GREATCOATED INTO THE ROOM WHERE SHE
AND ELEANOR WERE SITTING, AND SAID, "I AM COME, YOUNG LADIES, IN A
VERY MORALIZING STRAIN, TO OBSERVE THAT OUR PLEASURES IN THIS WORLD
ARE ALWAYS TO BE PAID FOR, AND THAT WE OFTEN PURCHASE THEM AT A GREAT
DISADVANTAGE, GIVING READY-MONIED ACTUAL HAPPINESS FOR A DRAFT ON THE
FUTURE, THAT MAY NOT BE HONOURED. WITNESS MYSELF, AT THIS PRESENT HOUR.
BECAUSE I AM TO HOPE FOR THE SATISFACTION OF SEEING YOU AT WOODSTON ON
WEDNESDAY, WHICH BAD WEATHER, OR TWENTY OTHER CAUSES, MAY PREVENT, I
MUST GO AWAY DIRECTLY, TWO DAYS BEFORE I INTENDED IT."

"GO AWAY!" SAID CATHERINE, WITH A VERY LONG FACE. "AND WHY?"

"WHY! HOW CAN YOU ASK THE QUESTION? BECAUSE NO TIME IS TO BE LOST IN
FRIGHTENING MY OLD HOUSEKEEPER OUT OF HER WITS, BECAUSE I MUST GO AND
PREPARE A DINNER FOR YOU, TO BE SURE."

"OH! NOT SERIOUSLY!"

"AYE, AND SADLY TOO--FOR I HAD MUCH RATHER STAY."

"BUT HOW CAN YOU THINK OF SUCH A THING, AFTER WHAT THE GENERAL SAID?
WHEN HE SO PARTICULARLY DESIRED YOU NOT TO GIVE YOURSELF ANY TROUBLE,
BECAUSE ANYTHING WOULD DO."

HENRY ONLY SMILED. "I AM SURE IT IS QUITE UNNECESSARY UPON YOUR SISTER'S
ACCOUNT AND MINE. YOU MUST KNOW IT TO BE SO; AND THE GENERAL MADE SUCH
A POINT OF YOUR PROVIDING NOTHING EXTRAORDINARY: BESIDES, IF HE HAD NOT
SAID HALF SO MUCH AS HE DID, HE HAS ALWAYS SUCH AN EXCELLENT DINNER
AT HOME, THAT SITTING DOWN TO A MIDDLING ONE FOR ONE DAY COULD NOT
SIGNIFY."

"I WISH I COULD REASON LIKE YOU, FOR HIS SAKE AND MY OWN. GOOD-BYE. AS
TOMORROW IS SUNDAY, ELEANOR, I SHALL NOT RETURN."

HE WENT; AND, IT BEING AT ANY TIME A MUCH SIMPLER OPERATION TO CATHERINE
TO DOUBT HER OWN JUDGMENT THAN HENRY'S, SHE WAS VERY SOON OBLIGED TO
GIVE HIM CREDIT FOR BEING RIGHT, HOWEVER DISAGREEABLE TO HER HIS GOING.
BUT THE INEXPLICABILITY OF THE GENERAL'S CONDUCT DWELT MUCH ON HER
THOUGHTS. THAT HE WAS VERY PARTICULAR IN HIS EATING, SHE HAD, BY HER OWN
UNASSISTED OBSERVATION, ALREADY DISCOVERED; BUT WHY HE SHOULD SAY
ONE THING SO POSITIVELY, AND MEAN ANOTHER ALL THE WHILE, WAS MOST
UNACCOUNTABLE! HOW WERE PEOPLE, AT THAT RATE, TO BE UNDERSTOOD? WHO BUT
HENRY COULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF WHAT HIS FATHER WAS AT?

FROM SATURDAY TO WEDNESDAY, HOWEVER, THEY WERE NOW TO BE WITHOUT HENRY.
THIS WAS THE SAD FINALE OF EVERY REFLECTION: AND CAPTAIN TILNEY'S LETTER
WOULD CERTAINLY COME IN HIS ABSENCE; AND WEDNESDAY SHE WAS VERY SURE
WOULD BE WET. THE PAST, PRESENT, AND FUTURE WERE ALL EQUALLY IN GLOOM.
HER BROTHER SO UNHAPPY, AND HER LOSS IN ISABELLA SO GREAT; AND ELEANOR'S
SPIRITS ALWAYS AFFECTED BY HENRY'S ABSENCE! WHAT WAS THERE TO INTEREST
OR AMUSE HER? SHE WAS TIRED OF THE WOODS AND THE SHRUBBERIES--ALWAYS SO
SMOOTH AND SO DRY; AND THE ABBEY IN ITSELF WAS NO MORE TO HER NOW THAN
ANY OTHER HOUSE. THE PAINFUL REMEMBRANCE OF THE FOLLY IT HAD HELPED
TO NOURISH AND PERFECT WAS THE ONLY EMOTION WHICH COULD SPRING FROM A
CONSIDERATION OF THE BUILDING. WHAT A REVOLUTION IN HER IDEAS! SHE, WHO
HAD SO LONGED TO BE IN AN ABBEY! NOW, THERE WAS NOTHING SO CHARMING
TO HER IMAGINATION AS THE UNPRETENDING COMFORT OF A WELL-CONNECTED
PARSONAGE, SOMETHING LIKE FULLERTON, BUT BETTER: FULLERTON HAD ITS
FAULTS, BUT WOODSTON PROBABLY HAD NONE. IF WEDNESDAY SHOULD EVER COME!

IT DID COME, AND EXACTLY WHEN IT MIGHT BE REASONABLY LOOKED FOR. IT
CAME--IT WAS FINE--AND CATHERINE TROD ON AIR. BY TEN O'CLOCK, THE CHAISE
AND FOUR CONVEYED THE TWO FROM THE ABBEY; AND, AFTER AN AGREEABLE DRIVE
OF ALMOST TWENTY MILES, THEY ENTERED WOODSTON, A LARGE AND POPULOUS
VILLAGE, IN A SITUATION NOT UNPLEASANT. CATHERINE WAS ASHAMED TO SAY
HOW PRETTY SHE THOUGHT IT, AS THE GENERAL SEEMED TO THINK AN APOLOGY
NECESSARY FOR THE FLATNESS OF THE COUNTRY, AND THE SIZE OF THE VILLAGE;
BUT IN HER HEART SHE PREFERRED IT TO ANY PLACE SHE HAD EVER BEEN AT,
AND LOOKED WITH GREAT ADMIRATION AT EVERY NEAT HOUSE ABOVE THE RANK OF
A COTTAGE, AND AT ALL THE LITTLE CHANDLER'S SHOPS WHICH THEY PASSED. AT
THE FURTHER END OF THE VILLAGE, AND TOLERABLY DISENGAGED FROM THE REST
OF IT, STOOD THE PARSONAGE, A NEW-BUILT SUBSTANTIAL STONE HOUSE, WITH
ITS SEMICIRCULAR SWEEP AND GREEN GATES; AND, AS THEY DROVE UP TO THE
DOOR, HENRY, WITH THE FRIENDS OF HIS SOLITUDE, A LARGE NEWFOUNDLAND
PUPPY AND TWO OR THREE TERRIERS, WAS READY TO RECEIVE AND MAKE MUCH OF
THEM.

CATHERINE'S MIND WAS TOO FULL, AS SHE ENTERED THE HOUSE, FOR HER EITHER
TO OBSERVE OR TO SAY A GREAT DEAL; AND, TILL CALLED ON BY THE GENERAL
FOR HER OPINION OF IT, SHE HAD VERY LITTLE IDEA OF THE ROOM IN WHICH SHE
WAS SITTING. UPON LOOKING ROUND IT THEN, SHE PERCEIVED IN A MOMENT THAT
IT WAS THE MOST COMFORTABLE ROOM IN THE WORLD; BUT SHE WAS TOO GUARDED
TO SAY SO, AND THE COLDNESS OF HER PRAISE DISAPPOINTED HIM.

"WE ARE NOT CALLING IT A GOOD HOUSE," SAID HE. "WE ARE NOT COMPARING
IT WITH FULLERTON AND NORTHANGER--WE ARE CONSIDERING IT AS A MERE
PARSONAGE, SMALL AND CONFINED, WE ALLOW, BUT DECENT, PERHAPS, AND
HABITABLE; AND ALTOGETHER NOT INFERIOR TO THE GENERALITY; OR, IN OTHER
WORDS, I BELIEVE THERE ARE FEW COUNTRY PARSONAGES IN ENGLAND HALF SO
GOOD. IT MAY ADMIT OF IMPROVEMENT, HOWEVER. FAR BE IT FROM ME TO SAY
OTHERWISE; AND ANYTHING IN REASON--A BOW THROWN OUT, PERHAPS--THOUGH,
BETWEEN OURSELVES, IF THERE IS ONE THING MORE THAN ANOTHER MY AVERSION,
IT IS A PATCHED-ON BOW."

CATHERINE DID NOT HEAR ENOUGH OF THIS SPEECH TO UNDERSTAND OR BE PAINED
BY IT; AND OTHER SUBJECTS BEING STUDIOUSLY BROUGHT FORWARD AND SUPPORTED
BY HENRY, AT THE SAME TIME THAT A TRAY FULL OF REFRESHMENTS WAS
INTRODUCED BY HIS SERVANT, THE GENERAL WAS SHORTLY RESTORED TO HIS
COMPLACENCY, AND CATHERINE TO ALL HER USUAL EASE OF SPIRITS.

THE ROOM IN QUESTION WAS OF A COMMODIOUS, WELL-PROPORTIONED SIZE, AND
HANDSOMELY FITTED UP AS A DINING-PARLOUR; AND ON THEIR QUITTING IT TO
WALK ROUND THE GROUNDS, SHE WAS SHOWN, FIRST INTO A SMALLER APARTMENT,
BELONGING PECULIARLY TO THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE, AND MADE UNUSUALLY TIDY
ON THE OCCASION; AND AFTERWARDS INTO WHAT WAS TO BE THE DRAWING-ROOM,
WITH THE APPEARANCE OF WHICH, THOUGH UNFURNISHED, CATHERINE WAS
DELIGHTED ENOUGH EVEN TO SATISFY THE GENERAL. IT WAS A PRETTILY SHAPED
ROOM, THE WINDOWS REACHING TO THE GROUND, AND THE VIEW FROM THEM
PLEASANT, THOUGH ONLY OVER GREEN MEADOWS; AND SHE EXPRESSED HER
ADMIRATION AT THE MOMENT WITH ALL THE HONEST SIMPLICITY WITH WHICH SHE
FELT IT. "OH! WHY DO NOT YOU FIT UP THIS ROOM, MR. TILNEY? WHAT A PITY
NOT TO HAVE IT FITTED UP! IT IS THE PRETTIEST ROOM I EVER SAW; IT IS THE
PRETTIEST ROOM IN THE WORLD!"

"I TRUST," SAID THE GENERAL, WITH A MOST SATISFIED SMILE, "THAT IT WILL
VERY SPEEDILY BE FURNISHED: IT WAITS ONLY FOR A LADY'S TASTE!"

"WELL, IF IT WAS MY HOUSE, I SHOULD NEVER SIT ANYWHERE ELSE. OH! WHAT A
SWEET LITTLE COTTAGE THERE IS AMONG THE TREES--APPLE TREES, TOO! IT IS
THE PRETTIEST COTTAGE!"

"YOU LIKE IT--YOU APPROVE IT AS AN OBJECT--IT IS ENOUGH. HENRY, REMEMBER
THAT ROBINSON IS SPOKEN TO ABOUT IT. THE COTTAGE REMAINS."

SUCH A COMPLIMENT RECALLED ALL CATHERINE'S CONSCIOUSNESS, AND SILENCED
HER DIRECTLY; AND, THOUGH POINTEDLY APPLIED TO BY THE GENERAL FOR HER
CHOICE OF THE PREVAILING COLOUR OF THE PAPER AND HANGINGS, NOTHING LIKE
AN OPINION ON THE SUBJECT COULD BE DRAWN FROM HER. THE INFLUENCE OF
FRESH OBJECTS AND FRESH AIR, HOWEVER, WAS OF GREAT USE IN DISSIPATING
THESE EMBARRASSING ASSOCIATIONS; AND, HAVING REACHED THE ORNAMENTAL PART
OF THE PREMISES, CONSISTING OF A WALK ROUND TWO SIDES OF A MEADOW, ON
WHICH HENRY'S GENIUS HAD BEGUN TO ACT ABOUT HALF A YEAR AGO, SHE WAS
SUFFICIENTLY RECOVERED TO THINK IT PRETTIER THAN ANY PLEASURE-GROUND SHE
HAD EVER BEEN IN BEFORE, THOUGH THERE WAS NOT A SHRUB IN IT HIGHER THAN
THE GREEN BENCH IN THE CORNER.

A SAUNTER INTO OTHER MEADOWS, AND THROUGH PART OF THE VILLAGE, WITH A
VISIT TO THE STABLES TO EXAMINE SOME IMPROVEMENTS, AND A CHARMING GAME
OF PLAY WITH A LITTER OF PUPPIES JUST ABLE TO ROLL ABOUT, BROUGHT THEM
TO FOUR O'CLOCK, WHEN CATHERINE SCARCELY THOUGHT IT COULD BE THREE. AT
FOUR THEY WERE TO DINE, AND AT SIX TO SET OFF ON THEIR RETURN. NEVER HAD
ANY DAY PASSED SO QUICKLY!

SHE COULD NOT BUT OBSERVE THAT THE ABUNDANCE OF THE DINNER DID NOT SEEM
TO CREATE THE SMALLEST ASTONISHMENT IN THE GENERAL; NAY, THAT HE WAS
EVEN LOOKING AT THE SIDE-TABLE FOR COLD MEAT WHICH WAS NOT THERE. HIS
SON AND DAUGHTER'S OBSERVATIONS WERE OF A DIFFERENT KIND. THEY HAD
SELDOM SEEN HIM EAT SO HEARTILY AT ANY TABLE BUT HIS OWN, AND NEVER
BEFORE KNOWN HIM SO LITTLE DISCONCERTED BY THE MELTED BUTTER'S BEING
OILED.

AT SIX O'CLOCK, THE GENERAL HAVING TAKEN HIS COFFEE, THE CARRIAGE AGAIN
RECEIVED THEM; AND SO GRATIFYING HAD BEEN THE TENOR OF HIS CONDUCT
THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE VISIT, SO WELL ASSURED WAS HER MIND ON THE SUBJECT
OF HIS EXPECTATIONS, THAT, COULD SHE HAVE FELT EQUALLY CONFIDENT OF THE
WISHES OF HIS SON, CATHERINE WOULD HAVE QUITTED WOODSTON WITH LITTLE
ANXIETY AS TO THE HOW OR THE WHEN SHE MIGHT RETURN TO IT.




CHAPTER 27


THE NEXT MORNING BROUGHT THE FOLLOWING VERY UNEXPECTED LETTER FROM
ISABELLA:


BATH, APRIL

MY DEAREST CATHERINE, I RECEIVED YOUR TWO KIND LETTERS WITH THE GREATEST
DELIGHT, AND HAVE A THOUSAND APOLOGIES TO MAKE FOR NOT ANSWERING THEM
SOONER. I REALLY AM QUITE ASHAMED OF MY IDLENESS; BUT IN THIS HORRID
PLACE ONE CAN FIND TIME FOR NOTHING. I HAVE HAD MY PEN IN MY HAND TO
BEGIN A LETTER TO YOU ALMOST EVERY DAY SINCE YOU LEFT BATH, BUT HAVE
ALWAYS BEEN PREVENTED BY SOME SILLY TRIFLER OR OTHER. PRAY WRITE TO ME
SOON, AND DIRECT TO MY OWN HOME. THANK GOD, WE LEAVE THIS VILE PLACE
TOMORROW. SINCE YOU WENT AWAY, I HAVE HAD NO PLEASURE IN IT--THE DUST
IS BEYOND ANYTHING; AND EVERYBODY ONE CARES FOR IS GONE. I BELIEVE IF I
COULD SEE YOU I SHOULD NOT MIND THE REST, FOR YOU ARE DEARER TO ME THAN
ANYBODY CAN CONCEIVE. I AM QUITE UNEASY ABOUT YOUR DEAR BROTHER, NOT
HAVING HEARD FROM HIM SINCE HE WENT TO OXFORD; AND AM FEARFUL OF SOME
MISUNDERSTANDING. YOUR KIND OFFICES WILL SET ALL RIGHT: HE IS THE ONLY
MAN I EVER DID OR COULD LOVE, AND I TRUST YOU WILL CONVINCE HIM OF IT.
THE SPRING FASHIONS ARE PARTLY DOWN; AND THE HATS THE MOST FRIGHTFUL YOU
CAN IMAGINE. I HOPE YOU SPEND YOUR TIME PLEASANTLY, BUT AM AFRAID YOU
NEVER THINK OF ME. I WILL NOT SAY ALL THAT I COULD OF THE FAMILY YOU ARE
WITH, BECAUSE I WOULD NOT BE UNGENEROUS, OR SET YOU AGAINST THOSE YOU
ESTEEM; BUT IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO KNOW WHOM TO TRUST, AND YOUNG MEN
NEVER KNOW THEIR MINDS TWO DAYS TOGETHER. I REJOICE TO SAY THAT THE
YOUNG MAN WHOM, OF ALL OTHERS, I PARTICULARLY ABHOR, HAS LEFT BATH. YOU
WILL KNOW, FROM THIS DESCRIPTION, I MUST MEAN CAPTAIN TILNEY, WHO, AS
YOU MAY REMEMBER, WAS AMAZINGLY DISPOSED TO FOLLOW AND TEASE ME, BEFORE
YOU WENT AWAY. AFTERWARDS HE GOT WORSE, AND BECAME QUITE MY SHADOW. MANY
GIRLS MIGHT HAVE BEEN TAKEN IN, FOR NEVER WERE SUCH ATTENTIONS; BUT I
KNEW THE FICKLE SEX TOO WELL. HE WENT AWAY TO HIS REGIMENT TWO DAYS AGO,
AND I TRUST I SHALL NEVER BE PLAGUED WITH HIM AGAIN. HE IS THE GREATEST
COXCOMB I EVER SAW, AND AMAZINGLY DISAGREEABLE. THE LAST TWO DAYS HE WAS
ALWAYS BY THE SIDE OF CHARLOTTE DAVIS: I PITIED HIS TASTE, BUT TOOK NO
NOTICE OF HIM. THE LAST TIME WE MET WAS IN BATH STREET, AND I TURNED
DIRECTLY INTO A SHOP THAT HE MIGHT NOT SPEAK TO ME; I WOULD NOT EVEN
LOOK AT HIM. HE WENT INTO THE PUMP-ROOM AFTERWARDS; BUT I WOULD NOT HAVE
FOLLOWED HIM FOR ALL THE WORLD. SUCH A CONTRAST BETWEEN HIM AND YOUR
BROTHER! PRAY SEND ME SOME NEWS OF THE LATTER--I AM QUITE UNHAPPY ABOUT
HIM; HE SEEMED SO UNCOMFORTABLE WHEN HE WENT AWAY, WITH A COLD, OR
SOMETHING THAT AFFECTED HIS SPIRITS. I WOULD WRITE TO HIM MYSELF, BUT
HAVE MISLAID HIS DIRECTION; AND, AS I HINTED ABOVE, AM AFRAID HE
TOOK SOMETHING IN MY CONDUCT AMISS. PRAY EXPLAIN EVERYTHING TO HIS
SATISFACTION; OR, IF HE STILL HARBOURS ANY DOUBT, A LINE FROM HIMSELF
TO ME, OR A CALL AT PUTNEY WHEN NEXT IN TOWN, MIGHT SET ALL TO RIGHTS.
I HAVE NOT BEEN TO THE ROOMS THIS AGE, NOR TO THE PLAY, EXCEPT GOING IN
LAST NIGHT WITH THE HODGES, FOR A FROLIC, AT HALF PRICE: THEY TEASED
ME INTO IT; AND I WAS DETERMINED THEY SHOULD NOT SAY I SHUT MYSELF UP
BECAUSE TILNEY WAS GONE. WE HAPPENED TO SIT BY THE MITCHELLS, AND THEY
PRETENDED TO BE QUITE SURPRISED TO SEE ME OUT. I KNEW THEIR SPITE: AT
ONE TIME THEY COULD NOT BE CIVIL TO ME, BUT NOW THEY ARE ALL FRIENDSHIP;
BUT I AM NOT SUCH A FOOL AS TO BE TAKEN IN BY THEM. YOU KNOW I HAVE A
PRETTY GOOD SPIRIT OF MY OWN. ANNE MITCHELL HAD TRIED TO PUT ON A
TURBAN LIKE MINE, AS I WORE IT THE WEEK BEFORE AT THE CONCERT, BUT MADE
WRETCHED WORK OF IT--IT HAPPENED TO BECOME MY ODD FACE, I BELIEVE, AT
LEAST TILNEY TOLD ME SO AT THE TIME, AND SAID EVERY EYE WAS UPON ME; BUT
HE IS THE LAST MAN WHOSE WORD I WOULD TAKE. I WEAR NOTHING BUT PURPLE
NOW: I KNOW I LOOK HIDEOUS IN IT, BUT NO MATTER--IT IS YOUR DEAR
BROTHER'S FAVOURITE COLOUR. LOSE NO TIME, MY DEAREST, SWEETEST
CATHERINE, IN WRITING TO HIM AND TO ME, WHO EVER AM, ETC.


SUCH A STRAIN OF SHALLOW ARTIFICE COULD NOT IMPOSE EVEN UPON CATHERINE.
ITS INCONSISTENCIES, CONTRADICTIONS, AND FALSEHOOD STRUCK HER FROM THE
VERY FIRST. SHE WAS ASHAMED OF ISABELLA, AND ASHAMED OF HAVING EVER
LOVED HER. HER PROFESSIONS OF ATTACHMENT WERE NOW AS DISGUSTING AS HER
EXCUSES WERE EMPTY, AND HER DEMANDS IMPUDENT. "WRITE TO JAMES ON HER
BEHALF! NO, JAMES SHOULD NEVER HEAR ISABELLA'S NAME MENTIONED BY HER
AGAIN."

ON HENRY'S ARRIVAL FROM WOODSTON, SHE MADE KNOWN TO HIM AND ELEANOR
THEIR BROTHER'S SAFETY, CONGRATULATING THEM WITH SINCERITY ON IT, AND
READING ALOUD THE MOST MATERIAL PASSAGES OF HER LETTER WITH STRONG
INDIGNATION. WHEN SHE HAD FINISHED IT--"SO MUCH FOR ISABELLA," SHE
CRIED, "AND FOR ALL OUR INTIMACY! SHE MUST THINK ME AN IDIOT, OR SHE
COULD NOT HAVE WRITTEN SO; BUT PERHAPS THIS HAS SERVED TO MAKE HER
CHARACTER BETTER KNOWN TO ME THAN MINE IS TO HER. I SEE WHAT SHE HAS
BEEN ABOUT. SHE IS A VAIN COQUETTE, AND HER TRICKS HAVE NOT ANSWERED. I
DO NOT BELIEVE SHE HAD EVER ANY REGARD EITHER FOR JAMES OR FOR ME, AND I
WISH I HAD NEVER KNOWN HER."

"IT WILL SOON BE AS IF YOU NEVER HAD," SAID HENRY.

"THERE IS BUT ONE THING THAT I CANNOT UNDERSTAND. I SEE THAT SHE HAS
HAD DESIGNS ON CAPTAIN TILNEY, WHICH HAVE NOT SUCCEEDED; BUT I DO NOT
UNDERSTAND WHAT CAPTAIN TILNEY HAS BEEN ABOUT ALL THIS TIME. WHY SHOULD
HE PAY HER SUCH ATTENTIONS AS TO MAKE HER QUARREL WITH MY BROTHER, AND
THEN FLY OFF HIMSELF?"

"I HAVE VERY LITTLE TO SAY FOR FREDERICK'S MOTIVES, SUCH AS I BELIEVE
THEM TO HAVE BEEN. HE HAS HIS VANITIES AS WELL AS MISS THORPE, AND THE
CHIEF DIFFERENCE IS, THAT, HAVING A STRONGER HEAD, THEY HAVE NOT YET
INJURED HIMSELF. IF THE EFFECT OF HIS BEHAVIOUR DOES NOT JUSTIFY HIM
WITH YOU, WE HAD BETTER NOT SEEK AFTER THE CAUSE."

"THEN YOU DO NOT SUPPOSE HE EVER REALLY CARED ABOUT HER?"

"I AM PERSUADED THAT HE NEVER DID."

"AND ONLY MADE BELIEVE TO DO SO FOR MISCHIEF'S SAKE?"

HENRY BOWED HIS ASSENT.

"WELL, THEN, I MUST SAY THAT I DO NOT LIKE HIM AT ALL. THOUGH IT HAS
TURNED OUT SO WELL FOR US, I DO NOT LIKE HIM AT ALL. AS IT HAPPENS,
THERE IS NO GREAT HARM DONE, BECAUSE I DO NOT THINK ISABELLA HAS ANY
HEART TO LOSE. BUT, SUPPOSE HE HAD MADE HER VERY MUCH IN LOVE WITH HIM?"

"BUT WE MUST FIRST SUPPOSE ISABELLA TO HAVE HAD A HEART TO
LOSE--CONSEQUENTLY TO HAVE BEEN A VERY DIFFERENT CREATURE; AND, IN THAT
CASE, SHE WOULD HAVE MET WITH VERY DIFFERENT TREATMENT."

"IT IS VERY RIGHT THAT YOU SHOULD STAND BY YOUR BROTHER."

"AND IF YOU WOULD STAND BY YOURS, YOU WOULD NOT BE MUCH DISTRESSED BY
THE DISAPPOINTMENT OF MISS THORPE. BUT YOUR MIND IS WARPED BY AN INNATE
PRINCIPLE OF GENERAL INTEGRITY, AND THEREFORE NOT ACCESSIBLE TO THE COOL
REASONINGS OF FAMILY PARTIALITY, OR A DESIRE OF REVENGE."

CATHERINE WAS COMPLIMENTED OUT OF FURTHER BITTERNESS. FREDERICK COULD
NOT BE UNPARDONABLY GUILTY, WHILE HENRY MADE HIMSELF SO AGREEABLE. SHE
RESOLVED ON NOT ANSWERING ISABELLA'S LETTER, AND TRIED TO THINK NO MORE
OF IT.




CHAPTER 28


SOON AFTER THIS, THE GENERAL FOUND HIMSELF OBLIGED TO GO TO LONDON FOR
A WEEK; AND HE LEFT NORTHANGER EARNESTLY REGRETTING THAT ANY NECESSITY
SHOULD ROB HIM EVEN FOR AN HOUR OF MISS MORLAND'S COMPANY, AND ANXIOUSLY
RECOMMENDING THE STUDY OF HER COMFORT AND AMUSEMENT TO HIS CHILDREN
AS THEIR CHIEF OBJECT IN HIS ABSENCE. HIS DEPARTURE GAVE CATHERINE THE
FIRST EXPERIMENTAL CONVICTION THAT A LOSS MAY BE SOMETIMES A GAIN. THE
HAPPINESS WITH WHICH THEIR TIME NOW PASSED, EVERY EMPLOYMENT VOLUNTARY,
EVERY LAUGH INDULGED, EVERY MEAL A SCENE OF EASE AND GOOD HUMOUR,
WALKING WHERE THEY LIKED AND WHEN THEY LIKED, THEIR HOURS, PLEASURES,
AND FATIGUES AT THEIR OWN COMMAND, MADE HER THOROUGHLY SENSIBLE OF THE
RESTRAINT WHICH THE GENERAL'S PRESENCE HAD IMPOSED, AND MOST THANKFULLY
FEEL THEIR PRESENT RELEASE FROM IT. SUCH EASE AND SUCH DELIGHTS MADE HER
LOVE THE PLACE AND THE PEOPLE MORE AND MORE EVERY DAY; AND HAD IT NOT
BEEN FOR A DREAD OF ITS SOON BECOMING EXPEDIENT TO LEAVE THE ONE, AND
AN APPREHENSION OF NOT BEING EQUALLY BELOVED BY THE OTHER, SHE WOULD AT
EACH MOMENT OF EACH DAY HAVE BEEN PERFECTLY HAPPY; BUT SHE WAS NOW IN
THE FOURTH WEEK OF HER VISIT; BEFORE THE GENERAL CAME HOME, THE FOURTH
WEEK WOULD BE TURNED, AND PERHAPS IT MIGHT SEEM AN INTRUSION IF SHE
STAYED MUCH LONGER. THIS WAS A PAINFUL CONSIDERATION WHENEVER IT
OCCURRED; AND EAGER TO GET RID OF SUCH A WEIGHT ON HER MIND, SHE VERY
SOON RESOLVED TO SPEAK TO ELEANOR ABOUT IT AT ONCE, PROPOSE GOING AWAY,
AND BE GUIDED IN HER CONDUCT BY THE MANNER IN WHICH HER PROPOSAL MIGHT
BE TAKEN.

AWARE THAT IF SHE GAVE HERSELF MUCH TIME, SHE MIGHT FEEL IT DIFFICULT TO
BRING FORWARD SO UNPLEASANT A SUBJECT, SHE TOOK THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY OF
BEING SUDDENLY ALONE WITH ELEANOR, AND OF ELEANOR'S BEING IN THE
MIDDLE OF A SPEECH ABOUT SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT, TO START FORTH HER
OBLIGATION OF GOING AWAY VERY SOON. ELEANOR LOOKED AND DECLARED HERSELF
MUCH CONCERNED. SHE HAD "HOPED FOR THE PLEASURE OF HER COMPANY FOR A
MUCH LONGER TIME--HAD BEEN MISLED (PERHAPS BY HER WISHES) TO SUPPOSE
THAT A MUCH LONGER VISIT HAD BEEN PROMISED--AND COULD NOT BUT THINK THAT
IF MR. AND MRS. MORLAND WERE AWARE OF THE PLEASURE IT WAS TO HER TO HAVE
HER THERE, THEY WOULD BE TOO GENEROUS TO HASTEN HER RETURN." CATHERINE
EXPLAINED: "OH! AS TO THAT, PAPA AND MAMMA WERE IN NO HURRY AT ALL. AS
LONG AS SHE WAS HAPPY, THEY WOULD ALWAYS BE SATISFIED."

"THEN WHY, MIGHT SHE ASK, IN SUCH A HURRY HERSELF TO LEAVE THEM?"

"OH! BECAUSE SHE HAD BEEN THERE SO LONG."

"NAY, IF YOU CAN USE SUCH A WORD, I CAN URGE YOU NO FARTHER. IF YOU
THINK IT LONG--"

"OH! NO, I DO NOT INDEED. FOR MY OWN PLEASURE, I COULD STAY WITH YOU AS
LONG AGAIN." AND IT WAS DIRECTLY SETTLED THAT, TILL SHE HAD, HER LEAVING
THEM WAS NOT EVEN TO BE THOUGHT OF. IN HAVING THIS CAUSE OF UNEASINESS
SO PLEASANTLY REMOVED, THE FORCE OF THE OTHER WAS LIKEWISE WEAKENED. THE
KINDNESS, THE EARNESTNESS OF ELEANOR'S MANNER IN PRESSING HER TO STAY,
AND HENRY'S GRATIFIED LOOK ON BEING TOLD THAT HER STAY WAS DETERMINED,
WERE SUCH SWEET PROOFS OF HER IMPORTANCE WITH THEM, AS LEFT HER ONLY
JUST SO MUCH SOLICITUDE AS THE HUMAN MIND CAN NEVER DO COMFORTABLY
WITHOUT. SHE DID--ALMOST ALWAYS--BELIEVE THAT HENRY LOVED HER, AND QUITE
ALWAYS THAT HIS FATHER AND SISTER LOVED AND EVEN WISHED HER TO BELONG
TO THEM; AND BELIEVING SO FAR, HER DOUBTS AND ANXIETIES WERE MERELY
SPORTIVE IRRITATIONS.

HENRY WAS NOT ABLE TO OBEY HIS FATHER'S INJUNCTION OF REMAINING WHOLLY
AT NORTHANGER IN ATTENDANCE ON THE LADIES, DURING HIS ABSENCE IN LONDON,
THE ENGAGEMENTS OF HIS CURATE AT WOODSTON OBLIGING HIM TO LEAVE THEM ON
SATURDAY FOR A COUPLE OF NIGHTS. HIS LOSS WAS NOT NOW WHAT IT HAD BEEN
WHILE THE GENERAL WAS AT HOME; IT LESSENED THEIR GAIETY, BUT DID NOT
RUIN THEIR COMFORT; AND THE TWO GIRLS AGREEING IN OCCUPATION, AND
IMPROVING IN INTIMACY, FOUND THEMSELVES SO WELL SUFFICIENT FOR THE TIME
TO THEMSELVES, THAT IT WAS ELEVEN O'CLOCK, RATHER A LATE HOUR AT
THE ABBEY, BEFORE THEY QUITTED THE SUPPER-ROOM ON THE DAY OF HENRY'S
DEPARTURE. THEY HAD JUST REACHED THE HEAD OF THE STAIRS WHEN IT SEEMED,
AS FAR AS THE THICKNESS OF THE WALLS WOULD ALLOW THEM TO JUDGE, THAT A
CARRIAGE WAS DRIVING UP TO THE DOOR, AND THE NEXT MOMENT CONFIRMED THE
IDEA BY THE LOUD NOISE OF THE HOUSE-BELL. AFTER THE FIRST PERTURBATION
OF SURPRISE HAD PASSED AWAY, IN A "GOOD HEAVEN! WHAT CAN BE THE MATTER?"
IT WAS QUICKLY DECIDED BY ELEANOR TO BE HER ELDEST BROTHER, WHOSE
ARRIVAL WAS OFTEN AS SUDDEN, IF NOT QUITE SO UNSEASONABLE, AND
ACCORDINGLY SHE HURRIED DOWN TO WELCOME HIM.

CATHERINE WALKED ON TO HER CHAMBER, MAKING UP HER MIND AS WELL AS SHE
COULD, TO A FURTHER ACQUAINTANCE WITH CAPTAIN TILNEY, AND COMFORTING
HERSELF UNDER THE UNPLEASANT IMPRESSION HIS CONDUCT HAD GIVEN HER, AND
THE PERSUASION OF HIS BEING BY FAR TOO FINE A GENTLEMAN TO APPROVE OF
HER, THAT AT LEAST THEY SHOULD NOT MEET UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES AS
WOULD MAKE THEIR MEETING MATERIALLY PAINFUL. SHE TRUSTED HE WOULD NEVER
SPEAK OF MISS THORPE; AND INDEED, AS HE MUST BY THIS TIME BE ASHAMED OF
THE PART HE HAD ACTED, THERE COULD BE NO DANGER OF IT; AND AS LONG AS
ALL MENTION OF BATH SCENES WERE AVOIDED, SHE THOUGHT SHE COULD BEHAVE
TO HIM VERY CIVILLY. IN SUCH CONSIDERATIONS TIME PASSED AWAY, AND IT WAS
CERTAINLY IN HIS FAVOUR THAT ELEANOR SHOULD BE SO GLAD TO SEE HIM, AND
HAVE SO MUCH TO SAY, FOR HALF AN HOUR WAS ALMOST GONE SINCE HIS ARRIVAL,
AND ELEANOR DID NOT COME UP.

AT THAT MOMENT CATHERINE THOUGHT SHE HEARD HER STEP IN THE GALLERY, AND
LISTENED FOR ITS CONTINUANCE; BUT ALL WAS SILENT. SCARCELY, HOWEVER,
HAD SHE CONVICTED HER FANCY OF ERROR, WHEN THE NOISE OF SOMETHING MOVING
CLOSE TO HER DOOR MADE HER START; IT SEEMED AS IF SOMEONE WAS TOUCHING
THE VERY DOORWAY--AND IN ANOTHER MOMENT A SLIGHT MOTION OF THE LOCK
PROVED THAT SOME HAND MUST BE ON IT. SHE TREMBLED A LITTLE AT THE IDEA
OF ANYONE'S APPROACHING SO CAUTIOUSLY; BUT RESOLVING NOT TO BE AGAIN
OVERCOME BY TRIVIAL APPEARANCES OF ALARM, OR MISLED BY A RAISED
IMAGINATION, SHE STEPPED QUIETLY FORWARD, AND OPENED THE DOOR. ELEANOR,
AND ONLY ELEANOR, STOOD THERE. CATHERINE'S SPIRITS, HOWEVER, WERE
TRANQUILLIZED BUT FOR AN INSTANT, FOR ELEANOR'S CHEEKS WERE PALE, AND
HER MANNER GREATLY AGITATED. THOUGH EVIDENTLY INTENDING TO COME IN, IT
SEEMED AN EFFORT TO ENTER THE ROOM, AND A STILL GREATER TO SPEAK WHEN
THERE. CATHERINE, SUPPOSING SOME UNEASINESS ON CAPTAIN TILNEY'S ACCOUNT,
COULD ONLY EXPRESS HER CONCERN BY SILENT ATTENTION, OBLIGED HER TO BE
SEATED, RUBBED HER TEMPLES WITH LAVENDER-WATER, AND HUNG OVER HER WITH
AFFECTIONATE SOLICITUDE. "MY DEAR CATHERINE, YOU MUST NOT--YOU MUST NOT
INDEED--" WERE ELEANOR'S FIRST CONNECTED WORDS. "I AM QUITE WELL.
THIS KINDNESS DISTRACTS ME--I CANNOT BEAR IT--I COME TO YOU ON SUCH AN
ERRAND!"

"ERRAND! TO ME!"

"HOW SHALL I TELL YOU! OH! HOW SHALL I TELL YOU!"

A NEW IDEA NOW DARTED INTO CATHERINE'S MIND, AND TURNING AS PALE AS HER
FRIEND, SHE EXCLAIMED, "'TIS A MESSENGER FROM WOODSTON!"

"YOU ARE MISTAKEN, INDEED," RETURNED ELEANOR, LOOKING AT HER MOST
COMPASSIONATELY; "IT IS NO ONE FROM WOODSTON. IT IS MY FATHER HIMSELF."
HER VOICE FALTERED, AND HER EYES WERE TURNED TO THE GROUND AS SHE
MENTIONED HIS NAME. HIS UNLOOKED-FOR RETURN WAS ENOUGH IN ITSELF TO MAKE
CATHERINE'S HEART SINK, AND FOR A FEW MOMENTS SHE HARDLY SUPPOSED
THERE WERE ANYTHING WORSE TO BE TOLD. SHE SAID NOTHING; AND ELEANOR,
ENDEAVOURING TO COLLECT HERSELF AND SPEAK WITH FIRMNESS, BUT WITH EYES
STILL CAST DOWN, SOON WENT ON. "YOU ARE TOO GOOD, I AM SURE, TO THINK
THE WORSE OF ME FOR THE PART I AM OBLIGED TO PERFORM. I AM INDEED A MOST
UNWILLING MESSENGER. AFTER WHAT HAS SO LATELY PASSED, SO LATELY BEEN
SETTLED BETWEEN US--HOW JOYFULLY, HOW THANKFULLY ON MY SIDE!--AS TO YOUR
CONTINUING HERE AS I HOPED FOR MANY, MANY WEEKS LONGER, HOW CAN I TELL
YOU THAT YOUR KINDNESS IS NOT TO BE ACCEPTED--AND THAT THE HAPPINESS
YOUR COMPANY HAS HITHERTO GIVEN US IS TO BE REPAID BY--BUT I MUST NOT
TRUST MYSELF WITH WORDS. MY DEAR CATHERINE, WE ARE TO PART. MY FATHER
HAS RECOLLECTED AN ENGAGEMENT THAT TAKES OUR WHOLE FAMILY AWAY ON
MONDAY. WE ARE GOING TO LORD LONGTOWN'S, NEAR HEREFORD, FOR A FORTNIGHT.
EXPLANATION AND APOLOGY ARE EQUALLY IMPOSSIBLE. I CANNOT ATTEMPT
EITHER."

"MY DEAR ELEANOR," CRIED CATHERINE, SUPPRESSING HER FEELINGS AS WELL AS
SHE COULD, "DO NOT BE SO DISTRESSED. A SECOND ENGAGEMENT MUST GIVE
WAY TO A FIRST. I AM VERY, VERY SORRY WE ARE TO PART--SO SOON, AND SO
SUDDENLY TOO; BUT I AM NOT OFFENDED, INDEED I AM NOT. I CAN FINISH MY
VISIT HERE, YOU KNOW, AT ANY TIME; OR I HOPE YOU WILL COME TO ME. CAN
YOU, WHEN YOU RETURN FROM THIS LORD'S, COME TO FULLERTON?"

"IT WILL NOT BE IN MY POWER, CATHERINE."

"COME WHEN YOU CAN, THEN."

ELEANOR MADE NO ANSWER; AND CATHERINE'S THOUGHTS RECURRING TO SOMETHING
MORE DIRECTLY INTERESTING, SHE ADDED, THINKING ALOUD, "MONDAY--SO SOON
AS MONDAY; AND YOU ALL GO. WELL, I AM CERTAIN OF--I SHALL BE ABLE TO
TAKE LEAVE, HOWEVER. I NEED NOT GO TILL JUST BEFORE YOU DO, YOU KNOW. DO
NOT BE DISTRESSED, ELEANOR, I CAN GO ON MONDAY VERY WELL. MY FATHER
AND MOTHER'S HAVING NO NOTICE OF IT IS OF VERY LITTLE CONSEQUENCE. THE
GENERAL WILL SEND A SERVANT WITH ME, I DARE SAY, HALF THE WAY--AND THEN
I SHALL SOON BE AT SALISBURY, AND THEN I AM ONLY NINE MILES FROM HOME."

"AH, CATHERINE! WERE IT SETTLED SO, IT WOULD BE SOMEWHAT LESS
INTOLERABLE, THOUGH IN SUCH COMMON ATTENTIONS YOU WOULD HAVE RECEIVED
BUT HALF WHAT YOU OUGHT. BUT--HOW CAN I TELL YOU?--TOMORROW MORNING IS
FIXED FOR YOUR LEAVING US, AND NOT EVEN THE HOUR IS LEFT TO YOUR CHOICE;
THE VERY CARRIAGE IS ORDERED, AND WILL BE HERE AT SEVEN O'CLOCK, AND NO
SERVANT WILL BE OFFERED YOU."

CATHERINE SAT DOWN, BREATHLESS AND SPEECHLESS. "I COULD HARDLY BELIEVE
MY SENSES, WHEN I HEARD IT; AND NO DISPLEASURE, NO RESENTMENT THAT
YOU CAN FEEL AT THIS MOMENT, HOWEVER JUSTLY GREAT, CAN BE MORE THAN I
MYSELF--BUT I MUST NOT TALK OF WHAT I FELT. OH! THAT I COULD SUGGEST
ANYTHING IN EXTENUATION! GOOD GOD! WHAT WILL YOUR FATHER AND MOTHER SAY!
AFTER COURTING YOU FROM THE PROTECTION OF REAL FRIENDS TO THIS--ALMOST
DOUBLE DISTANCE FROM YOUR HOME, TO HAVE YOU DRIVEN OUT OF THE HOUSE,
WITHOUT THE CONSIDERATIONS EVEN OF DECENT CIVILITY! DEAR, DEAR
CATHERINE, IN BEING THE BEARER OF SUCH A MESSAGE, I SEEM GUILTY MYSELF
OF ALL ITS INSULT; YET, I TRUST YOU WILL ACQUIT ME, FOR YOU MUST HAVE
BEEN LONG ENOUGH IN THIS HOUSE TO SEE THAT I AM BUT A NOMINAL MISTRESS
OF IT, THAT MY REAL POWER IS NOTHING."

"HAVE I OFFENDED THE GENERAL?" SAID CATHERINE IN A FALTERING VOICE.

"ALAS! FOR MY FEELINGS AS A DAUGHTER, ALL THAT I KNOW, ALL THAT I
ANSWER FOR, IS THAT YOU CAN HAVE GIVEN HIM NO JUST CAUSE OF OFFENCE. HE
CERTAINLY IS GREATLY, VERY GREATLY DISCOMPOSED; I HAVE SELDOM SEEN HIM
MORE SO. HIS TEMPER IS NOT HAPPY, AND SOMETHING HAS NOW OCCURRED TO
RUFFLE IT IN AN UNCOMMON DEGREE; SOME DISAPPOINTMENT, SOME VEXATION,
WHICH JUST AT THIS MOMENT SEEMS IMPORTANT, BUT WHICH I CAN HARDLY
SUPPOSE YOU TO HAVE ANY CONCERN IN, FOR HOW IS IT POSSIBLE?"

IT WAS WITH PAIN THAT CATHERINE COULD SPEAK AT ALL; AND IT WAS ONLY FOR
ELEANOR'S SAKE THAT SHE ATTEMPTED IT. "I AM SURE," SAID SHE, "I AM VERY
SORRY IF I HAVE OFFENDED HIM. IT WAS THE LAST THING I WOULD WILLINGLY
HAVE DONE. BUT DO NOT BE UNHAPPY, ELEANOR. AN ENGAGEMENT, YOU KNOW, MUST
BE KEPT. I AM ONLY SORRY IT WAS NOT RECOLLECTED SOONER, THAT I MIGHT
HAVE WRITTEN HOME. BUT IT IS OF VERY LITTLE CONSEQUENCE."

"I HOPE, I EARNESTLY HOPE, THAT TO YOUR REAL SAFETY IT WILL BE OF NONE;
BUT TO EVERYTHING ELSE IT IS OF THE GREATEST CONSEQUENCE: TO COMFORT,
APPEARANCE, PROPRIETY, TO YOUR FAMILY, TO THE WORLD. WERE YOUR FRIENDS,
THE ALLENS, STILL IN BATH, YOU MIGHT GO TO THEM WITH COMPARATIVE EASE;
A FEW HOURS WOULD TAKE YOU THERE; BUT A JOURNEY OF SEVENTY MILES, TO BE
TAKEN POST BY YOU, AT YOUR AGE, ALONE, UNATTENDED!"

"OH, THE JOURNEY IS NOTHING. DO NOT THINK ABOUT THAT. AND IF WE ARE TO
PART, A FEW HOURS SOONER OR LATER, YOU KNOW, MAKES NO DIFFERENCE. I
CAN BE READY BY SEVEN. LET ME BE CALLED IN TIME." ELEANOR SAW THAT SHE
WISHED TO BE ALONE; AND BELIEVING IT BETTER FOR EACH THAT THEY SHOULD
AVOID ANY FURTHER CONVERSATION, NOW LEFT HER WITH, "I SHALL SEE YOU IN
THE MORNING."

CATHERINE'S SWELLING HEART NEEDED RELIEF. IN ELEANOR'S PRESENCE
FRIENDSHIP AND PRIDE HAD EQUALLY RESTRAINED HER TEARS, BUT NO SOONER WAS
SHE GONE THAN THEY BURST FORTH IN TORRENTS. TURNED FROM THE HOUSE, AND
IN SUCH A WAY! WITHOUT ANY REASON THAT COULD JUSTIFY, ANY APOLOGY THAT
COULD ATONE FOR THE ABRUPTNESS, THE RUDENESS, NAY, THE INSOLENCE OF
IT. HENRY AT A DISTANCE--NOT ABLE EVEN TO BID HIM FAREWELL. EVERY HOPE,
EVERY EXPECTATION FROM HIM SUSPENDED, AT LEAST, AND WHO COULD SAY HOW
LONG? WHO COULD SAY WHEN THEY MIGHT MEET AGAIN? AND ALL THIS BY SUCH
A MAN AS GENERAL TILNEY, SO POLITE, SO WELL BRED, AND HERETOFORE
SO PARTICULARLY FOND OF HER! IT WAS AS INCOMPREHENSIBLE AS IT WAS
MORTIFYING AND GRIEVOUS. FROM WHAT IT COULD ARISE, AND WHERE IT WOULD
END, WERE CONSIDERATIONS OF EQUAL PERPLEXITY AND ALARM. THE MANNER IN
WHICH IT WAS DONE SO GROSSLY UNCIVIL, HURRYING HER AWAY WITHOUT ANY
REFERENCE TO HER OWN CONVENIENCE, OR ALLOWING HER EVEN THE APPEARANCE
OF CHOICE AS TO THE TIME OR MODE OF HER TRAVELLING; OF TWO DAYS, THE
EARLIEST FIXED ON, AND OF THAT ALMOST THE EARLIEST HOUR, AS IF RESOLVED
TO HAVE HER GONE BEFORE HE WAS STIRRING IN THE MORNING, THAT HE
MIGHT NOT BE OBLIGED EVEN TO SEE HER. WHAT COULD ALL THIS MEAN BUT
AN INTENTIONAL AFFRONT? BY SOME MEANS OR OTHER SHE MUST HAVE HAD THE
MISFORTUNE TO OFFEND HIM. ELEANOR HAD WISHED TO SPARE HER FROM SO
PAINFUL A NOTION, BUT CATHERINE COULD NOT BELIEVE IT POSSIBLE THAT ANY
INJURY OR ANY MISFORTUNE COULD PROVOKE SUCH ILL WILL AGAINST A PERSON
NOT CONNECTED, OR, AT LEAST, NOT SUPPOSED TO BE CONNECTED WITH IT.

HEAVILY PASSED THE NIGHT. SLEEP, OR REPOSE THAT DESERVED THE NAME
OF SLEEP, WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION. THAT ROOM, IN WHICH HER DISTURBED
IMAGINATION HAD TORMENTED HER ON HER FIRST ARRIVAL, WAS AGAIN THE SCENE
OF AGITATED SPIRITS AND UNQUIET SLUMBERS. YET HOW DIFFERENT NOW THE
SOURCE OF HER INQUIETUDE FROM WHAT IT HAD BEEN THEN--HOW MOURNFULLY
SUPERIOR IN REALITY AND SUBSTANCE! HER ANXIETY HAD FOUNDATION IN
FACT, HER FEARS IN PROBABILITY; AND WITH A MIND SO OCCUPIED IN THE
CONTEMPLATION OF ACTUAL AND NATURAL EVIL, THE SOLITUDE OF HER SITUATION,
THE DARKNESS OF HER CHAMBER, THE ANTIQUITY OF THE BUILDING, WERE FELT
AND CONSIDERED WITHOUT THE SMALLEST EMOTION; AND THOUGH THE WIND WAS
HIGH, AND OFTEN PRODUCED STRANGE AND SUDDEN NOISES THROUGHOUT THE HOUSE,
SHE HEARD IT ALL AS SHE LAY AWAKE, HOUR AFTER HOUR, WITHOUT CURIOSITY OR
TERROR.

SOON AFTER SIX ELEANOR ENTERED HER ROOM, EAGER TO SHOW ATTENTION OR GIVE
ASSISTANCE WHERE IT WAS POSSIBLE; BUT VERY LITTLE REMAINED TO BE DONE.
CATHERINE HAD NOT LOITERED; SHE WAS ALMOST DRESSED, AND HER PACKING
ALMOST FINISHED. THE POSSIBILITY OF SOME CONCILIATORY MESSAGE FROM THE
GENERAL OCCURRED TO HER AS HIS DAUGHTER APPEARED. WHAT SO NATURAL, AS
THAT ANGER SHOULD PASS AWAY AND REPENTANCE SUCCEED IT? AND SHE ONLY
WANTED TO KNOW HOW FAR, AFTER WHAT HAD PASSED, AN APOLOGY MIGHT PROPERLY
BE RECEIVED BY HER. BUT THE KNOWLEDGE WOULD HAVE BEEN USELESS HERE;
IT WAS NOT CALLED FOR; NEITHER CLEMENCY NOR DIGNITY WAS PUT TO THE
TRIAL--ELEANOR BROUGHT NO MESSAGE. VERY LITTLE PASSED BETWEEN THEM ON
MEETING; EACH FOUND HER GREATEST SAFETY IN SILENCE, AND FEW AND TRIVIAL
WERE THE SENTENCES EXCHANGED WHILE THEY REMAINED UPSTAIRS, CATHERINE IN
BUSY AGITATION COMPLETING HER DRESS, AND ELEANOR WITH MORE GOODWILL THAN
EXPERIENCE INTENT UPON FILLING THE TRUNK. WHEN EVERYTHING WAS DONE THEY
LEFT THE ROOM, CATHERINE LINGERING ONLY HALF A MINUTE BEHIND HER FRIEND
TO THROW A PARTING GLANCE ON EVERY WELL-KNOWN, CHERISHED OBJECT, AND
WENT DOWN TO THE BREAKFAST-PARLOUR, WHERE BREAKFAST WAS PREPARED. SHE
TRIED TO EAT, AS WELL TO SAVE HERSELF FROM THE PAIN OF BEING URGED AS
TO MAKE HER FRIEND COMFORTABLE; BUT SHE HAD NO APPETITE, AND COULD NOT
SWALLOW MANY MOUTHFULS. THE CONTRAST BETWEEN THIS AND HER LAST BREAKFAST
IN THAT ROOM GAVE HER FRESH MISERY, AND STRENGTHENED HER DISTASTE FOR
EVERYTHING BEFORE HER. IT WAS NOT FOUR AND TWENTY HOURS AGO SINCE THEY
HAD MET THERE TO THE SAME REPAST, BUT IN CIRCUMSTANCES HOW DIFFERENT!
WITH WHAT CHEERFUL EASE, WHAT HAPPY, THOUGH FALSE, SECURITY, HAD SHE
THEN LOOKED AROUND HER, ENJOYING EVERYTHING PRESENT, AND FEARING LITTLE
IN FUTURE, BEYOND HENRY'S GOING TO WOODSTON FOR A DAY! HAPPY, HAPPY
BREAKFAST! FOR HENRY HAD BEEN THERE; HENRY HAD SAT BY HER AND HELPED
HER. THESE REFLECTIONS WERE LONG INDULGED UNDISTURBED BY ANY ADDRESS
FROM HER COMPANION, WHO SAT AS DEEP IN THOUGHT AS HERSELF; AND THE
APPEARANCE OF THE CARRIAGE WAS THE FIRST THING TO STARTLE AND RECALL
THEM TO THE PRESENT MOMENT. CATHERINE'S COLOUR ROSE AT THE SIGHT OF IT;
AND THE INDIGNITY WITH WHICH SHE WAS TREATED, STRIKING AT THAT INSTANT
ON HER MIND WITH PECULIAR FORCE, MADE HER FOR A SHORT TIME SENSIBLE ONLY
OF RESENTMENT. ELEANOR SEEMED NOW IMPELLED INTO RESOLUTION AND SPEECH.

"YOU MUST WRITE TO ME, CATHERINE," SHE CRIED; "YOU MUST LET ME HEAR FROM
YOU AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. TILL I KNOW YOU TO BE SAFE AT HOME, I SHALL
NOT HAVE AN HOUR'S COMFORT. FOR ONE LETTER, AT ALL RISKS, ALL HAZARDS, I
MUST ENTREAT. LET ME HAVE THE SATISFACTION OF KNOWING THAT YOU ARE SAFE
AT FULLERTON, AND HAVE FOUND YOUR FAMILY WELL, AND THEN, TILL I CAN ASK
FOR YOUR CORRESPONDENCE AS I OUGHT TO DO, I WILL NOT EXPECT MORE. DIRECT
TO ME AT LORD LONGTOWN'S, AND, I MUST ASK IT, UNDER COVER TO ALICE."

"NO, ELEANOR, IF YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO RECEIVE A LETTER FROM ME, I AM
SURE I HAD BETTER NOT WRITE. THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT OF MY GETTING HOME
SAFE."

ELEANOR ONLY REPLIED, "I CANNOT WONDER AT YOUR FEELINGS. I WILL NOT
IMPORTUNE YOU. I WILL TRUST TO YOUR OWN KINDNESS OF HEART WHEN I AM AT
A DISTANCE FROM YOU." BUT THIS, WITH THE LOOK OF SORROW ACCOMPANYING
IT, WAS ENOUGH TO MELT CATHERINE'S PRIDE IN A MOMENT, AND SHE INSTANTLY
SAID, "OH, ELEANOR, I WILL WRITE TO YOU INDEED."

THERE WAS YET ANOTHER POINT WHICH MISS TILNEY WAS ANXIOUS TO SETTLE,
THOUGH SOMEWHAT EMBARRASSED IN SPEAKING OF. IT HAD OCCURRED TO HER THAT
AFTER SO LONG AN ABSENCE FROM HOME, CATHERINE MIGHT NOT BE PROVIDED WITH
MONEY ENOUGH FOR THE EXPENSES OF HER JOURNEY, AND, UPON SUGGESTING IT
TO HER WITH MOST AFFECTIONATE OFFERS OF ACCOMMODATION, IT PROVED TO BE
EXACTLY THE CASE. CATHERINE HAD NEVER THOUGHT ON THE SUBJECT TILL THAT
MOMENT, BUT, UPON EXAMINING HER PURSE, WAS CONVINCED THAT BUT FOR
THIS KINDNESS OF HER FRIEND, SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN TURNED FROM THE HOUSE
WITHOUT EVEN THE MEANS OF GETTING HOME; AND THE DISTRESS IN WHICH SHE
MUST HAVE BEEN THEREBY INVOLVED FILLING THE MINDS OF BOTH, SCARCELY
ANOTHER WORD WAS SAID BY EITHER DURING THE TIME OF THEIR REMAINING
TOGETHER. SHORT, HOWEVER, WAS THAT TIME. THE CARRIAGE WAS SOON ANNOUNCED
TO BE READY; AND CATHERINE, INSTANTLY RISING, A LONG AND AFFECTIONATE
EMBRACE SUPPLIED THE PLACE OF LANGUAGE IN BIDDING EACH OTHER ADIEU; AND,
AS THEY ENTERED THE HALL, UNABLE TO LEAVE THE HOUSE WITHOUT SOME MENTION
OF ONE WHOSE NAME HAD NOT YET BEEN SPOKEN BY EITHER, SHE PAUSED A
MOMENT, AND WITH QUIVERING LIPS JUST MADE IT INTELLIGIBLE THAT SHE LEFT
"HER KIND REMEMBRANCE FOR HER ABSENT FRIEND." BUT WITH THIS APPROACH TO
HIS NAME ENDED ALL POSSIBILITY OF RESTRAINING HER FEELINGS; AND, HIDING
HER FACE AS WELL AS SHE COULD WITH HER HANDKERCHIEF, SHE DARTED ACROSS
THE HALL, JUMPED INTO THE CHAISE, AND IN A MOMENT WAS DRIVEN FROM THE
DOOR.




CHAPTER 29


CATHERINE WAS TOO WRETCHED TO BE FEARFUL. THE JOURNEY IN ITSELF HAD NO
TERRORS FOR HER; AND SHE BEGAN IT WITHOUT EITHER DREADING ITS LENGTH OR
FEELING ITS SOLITARINESS. LEANING BACK IN ONE CORNER OF THE CARRIAGE, IN
A VIOLENT BURST OF TEARS, SHE WAS CONVEYED SOME MILES BEYOND THE WALLS
OF THE ABBEY BEFORE SHE RAISED HER HEAD; AND THE HIGHEST POINT OF GROUND
WITHIN THE PARK WAS ALMOST CLOSED FROM HER VIEW BEFORE SHE WAS CAPABLE
OF TURNING HER EYES TOWARDS IT. UNFORTUNATELY, THE ROAD SHE NOW
TRAVELLED WAS THE SAME WHICH ONLY TEN DAYS AGO SHE HAD SO HAPPILY PASSED
ALONG IN GOING TO AND FROM WOODSTON; AND, FOR FOURTEEN MILES, EVERY
BITTER FEELING WAS RENDERED MORE SEVERE BY THE REVIEW OF OBJECTS ON
WHICH SHE HAD FIRST LOOKED UNDER IMPRESSIONS SO DIFFERENT. EVERY MILE,
AS IT BROUGHT HER NEARER WOODSTON, ADDED TO HER SUFFERINGS, AND WHEN
WITHIN THE DISTANCE OF FIVE, SHE PASSED THE TURNING WHICH LED TO IT, AND
THOUGHT OF HENRY, SO NEAR, YET SO UNCONSCIOUS, HER GRIEF AND AGITATION
WERE EXCESSIVE.

THE DAY WHICH SHE HAD SPENT AT THAT PLACE HAD BEEN ONE OF THE HAPPIEST
OF HER LIFE. IT WAS THERE, IT WAS ON THAT DAY, THAT THE GENERAL HAD MADE
USE OF SUCH EXPRESSIONS WITH REGARD TO HENRY AND HERSELF, HAD SO
SPOKEN AND SO LOOKED AS TO GIVE HER THE MOST POSITIVE CONVICTION OF HIS
ACTUALLY WISHING THEIR MARRIAGE. YES, ONLY TEN DAYS AGO HAD HE
ELATED HER BY HIS POINTED REGARD--HAD HE EVEN CONFUSED HER BY HIS TOO
SIGNIFICANT REFERENCE! AND NOW--WHAT HAD SHE DONE, OR WHAT HAD SHE
OMITTED TO DO, TO MERIT SUCH A CHANGE?

THE ONLY OFFENCE AGAINST HIM OF WHICH SHE COULD ACCUSE HERSELF HAD BEEN
SUCH AS WAS SCARCELY POSSIBLE TO REACH HIS KNOWLEDGE. HENRY AND HER OWN
HEART ONLY WERE PRIVY TO THE SHOCKING SUSPICIONS WHICH SHE HAD SO IDLY
ENTERTAINED; AND EQUALLY SAFE DID SHE BELIEVE HER SECRET WITH EACH.
DESIGNEDLY, AT LEAST, HENRY COULD NOT HAVE BETRAYED HER. IF, INDEED, BY
ANY STRANGE MISCHANCE HIS FATHER SHOULD HAVE GAINED INTELLIGENCE OF
WHAT SHE HAD DARED TO THINK AND LOOK FOR, OF HER CAUSELESS FANCIES
AND INJURIOUS EXAMINATIONS, SHE COULD NOT WONDER AT ANY DEGREE OF HIS
INDIGNATION. IF AWARE OF HER HAVING VIEWED HIM AS A MURDERER, SHE COULD
NOT WONDER AT HIS EVEN TURNING HER FROM HIS HOUSE. BUT A JUSTIFICATION
SO FULL OF TORTURE TO HERSELF, SHE TRUSTED, WOULD NOT BE IN HIS POWER.

ANXIOUS AS WERE ALL HER CONJECTURES ON THIS POINT, IT WAS NOT, HOWEVER,
THE ONE ON WHICH SHE DWELT MOST. THERE WAS A THOUGHT YET NEARER, A MORE
PREVAILING, MORE IMPETUOUS CONCERN. HOW HENRY WOULD THINK, AND FEEL,
AND LOOK, WHEN HE RETURNED ON THE MORROW TO NORTHANGER AND HEARD OF
HER BEING GONE, WAS A QUESTION OF FORCE AND INTEREST TO RISE OVER EVERY
OTHER, TO BE NEVER CEASING, ALTERNATELY IRRITATING AND SOOTHING; IT
SOMETIMES SUGGESTED THE DREAD OF HIS CALM ACQUIESCENCE, AND AT OTHERS
WAS ANSWERED BY THE SWEETEST CONFIDENCE IN HIS REGRET AND RESENTMENT. TO
THE GENERAL, OF COURSE, HE WOULD NOT DARE TO SPEAK; BUT TO ELEANOR--WHAT
MIGHT HE NOT SAY TO ELEANOR ABOUT HER?

IN THIS UNCEASING RECURRENCE OF DOUBTS AND INQUIRIES, ON ANY ONE ARTICLE
OF WHICH HER MIND WAS INCAPABLE OF MORE THAN MOMENTARY REPOSE, THE HOURS
PASSED AWAY, AND HER JOURNEY ADVANCED MUCH FASTER THAN SHE LOOKED FOR.
THE PRESSING ANXIETIES OF THOUGHT, WHICH PREVENTED HER FROM NOTICING
ANYTHING BEFORE HER, WHEN ONCE BEYOND THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF WOODSTON,
SAVED HER AT THE SAME TIME FROM WATCHING HER PROGRESS; AND THOUGH NO
OBJECT ON THE ROAD COULD ENGAGE A MOMENT'S ATTENTION, SHE FOUND NO STAGE
OF IT TEDIOUS. FROM THIS, SHE WAS PRESERVED TOO BY ANOTHER CAUSE, BY
FEELING NO EAGERNESS FOR HER JOURNEY'S CONCLUSION; FOR TO RETURN IN SUCH
A MANNER TO FULLERTON WAS ALMOST TO DESTROY THE PLEASURE OF A MEETING
WITH THOSE SHE LOVED BEST, EVEN AFTER AN ABSENCE SUCH AS HERS--AN ELEVEN
WEEKS' ABSENCE. WHAT HAD SHE TO SAY THAT WOULD NOT HUMBLE HERSELF AND
PAIN HER FAMILY, THAT WOULD NOT INCREASE HER OWN GRIEF BY THE CONFESSION
OF IT, EXTEND AN USELESS RESENTMENT, AND PERHAPS INVOLVE THE INNOCENT
WITH THE GUILTY IN UNDISTINGUISHING ILL WILL? SHE COULD NEVER DO JUSTICE
TO HENRY AND ELEANOR'S MERIT; SHE FELT IT TOO STRONGLY FOR EXPRESSION;
AND SHOULD A DISLIKE BE TAKEN AGAINST THEM, SHOULD THEY BE THOUGHT OF
UNFAVOURABLY, ON THEIR FATHER'S ACCOUNT, IT WOULD CUT HER TO THE HEART.

WITH THESE FEELINGS, SHE RATHER DREADED THAN SOUGHT FOR THE FIRST VIEW
OF THAT WELL-KNOWN SPIRE WHICH WOULD ANNOUNCE HER WITHIN TWENTY MILES OF
HOME. SALISBURY SHE HAD KNOWN TO BE HER POINT ON LEAVING NORTHANGER; BUT
AFTER THE FIRST STAGE SHE HAD BEEN INDEBTED TO THE POST-MASTERS FOR THE
NAMES OF THE PLACES WHICH WERE THEN TO CONDUCT HER TO IT; SO GREAT
HAD BEEN HER IGNORANCE OF HER ROUTE. SHE MET WITH NOTHING, HOWEVER,
TO DISTRESS OR FRIGHTEN HER. HER YOUTH, CIVIL MANNERS, AND LIBERAL
PAY PROCURED HER ALL THE ATTENTION THAT A TRAVELLER LIKE HERSELF COULD
REQUIRE; AND STOPPING ONLY TO CHANGE HORSES, SHE TRAVELLED ON FOR
ABOUT ELEVEN HOURS WITHOUT ACCIDENT OR ALARM, AND BETWEEN SIX AND SEVEN
O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING FOUND HERSELF ENTERING FULLERTON.

A HEROINE RETURNING, AT THE CLOSE OF HER CAREER, TO HER NATIVE VILLAGE,
IN ALL THE TRIUMPH OF RECOVERED REPUTATION, AND ALL THE DIGNITY OF
A COUNTESS, WITH A LONG TRAIN OF NOBLE RELATIONS IN THEIR SEVERAL
PHAETONS, AND THREE WAITING-MAIDS IN A TRAVELLING CHAISE AND FOUR,
BEHIND HER, IS AN EVENT ON WHICH THE PEN OF THE CONTRIVER MAY WELL
DELIGHT TO DWELL; IT GIVES CREDIT TO EVERY CONCLUSION, AND THE AUTHOR
MUST SHARE IN THE GLORY SHE SO LIBERALLY BESTOWS. BUT MY AFFAIR IS
WIDELY DIFFERENT; I BRING BACK MY HEROINE TO HER HOME IN SOLITUDE AND
DISGRACE; AND NO SWEET ELATION OF SPIRITS CAN LEAD ME INTO MINUTENESS.
A HEROINE IN A HACK POST-CHAISE IS SUCH A BLOW UPON SENTIMENT, AS NO
ATTEMPT AT GRANDEUR OR PATHOS CAN WITHSTAND. SWIFTLY THEREFORE SHALL HER
POST-BOY DRIVE THROUGH THE VILLAGE, AMID THE GAZE OF SUNDAY GROUPS, AND
SPEEDY SHALL BE HER DESCENT FROM IT.

BUT, WHATEVER MIGHT BE THE DISTRESS OF CATHERINE'S MIND, AS SHE THUS
ADVANCED TOWARDS THE PARSONAGE, AND WHATEVER THE HUMILIATION OF HER
BIOGRAPHER IN RELATING IT, SHE WAS PREPARING ENJOYMENT OF NO EVERYDAY
NATURE FOR THOSE TO WHOM SHE WENT; FIRST, IN THE APPEARANCE OF HER
CARRIAGE--AND SECONDLY, IN HERSELF. THE CHAISE OF A TRAVELLER BEING
A RARE SIGHT IN FULLERTON, THE WHOLE FAMILY WERE IMMEDIATELY AT THE
WINDOW; AND TO HAVE IT STOP AT THE SWEEP-GATE WAS A PLEASURE TO BRIGHTEN
EVERY EYE AND OCCUPY EVERY FANCY--A PLEASURE QUITE UNLOOKED FOR BY ALL
BUT THE TWO YOUNGEST CHILDREN, A BOY AND GIRL OF SIX AND FOUR YEARS OLD,
WHO EXPECTED A BROTHER OR SISTER IN EVERY CARRIAGE. HAPPY THE GLANCE
THAT FIRST DISTINGUISHED CATHERINE! HAPPY THE VOICE THAT PROCLAIMED THE
DISCOVERY! BUT WHETHER SUCH HAPPINESS WERE THE LAWFUL PROPERTY OF GEORGE
OR HARRIET COULD NEVER BE EXACTLY UNDERSTOOD.

HER FATHER, MOTHER, SARAH, GEORGE, AND HARRIET, ALL ASSEMBLED AT THE
DOOR TO WELCOME HER WITH AFFECTIONATE EAGERNESS, WAS A SIGHT TO AWAKEN
THE BEST FEELINGS OF CATHERINE'S HEART; AND IN THE EMBRACE OF EACH, AS
SHE STEPPED FROM THE CARRIAGE, SHE FOUND HERSELF SOOTHED BEYOND ANYTHING
THAT SHE HAD BELIEVED POSSIBLE. SO SURROUNDED, SO CARESSED, SHE WAS EVEN
HAPPY! IN THE JOYFULNESS OF FAMILY LOVE EVERYTHING FOR A SHORT TIME WAS
SUBDUED, AND THE PLEASURE OF SEEING HER, LEAVING THEM AT FIRST LITTLE
LEISURE FOR CALM CURIOSITY, THEY WERE ALL SEATED ROUND THE TEA-TABLE,
WHICH MRS. MORLAND HAD HURRIED FOR THE COMFORT OF THE POOR TRAVELLER,
WHOSE PALE AND JADED LOOKS SOON CAUGHT HER NOTICE, BEFORE ANY INQUIRY SO
DIRECT AS TO DEMAND A POSITIVE ANSWER WAS ADDRESSED TO HER.

RELUCTANTLY, AND WITH MUCH HESITATION, DID SHE THEN BEGIN WHAT MIGHT
PERHAPS, AT THE END OF HALF AN HOUR, BE TERMED, BY THE COURTESY OF HER
HEARERS, AN EXPLANATION; BUT SCARCELY, WITHIN THAT TIME, COULD THEY
AT ALL DISCOVER THE CAUSE, OR COLLECT THE PARTICULARS, OF HER SUDDEN
RETURN. THEY WERE FAR FROM BEING AN IRRITABLE RACE; FAR FROM ANY
QUICKNESS IN CATCHING, OR BITTERNESS IN RESENTING, AFFRONTS: BUT HERE,
WHEN THE WHOLE WAS UNFOLDED, WAS AN INSULT NOT TO BE OVERLOOKED, NOR,
FOR THE FIRST HALF HOUR, TO BE EASILY PARDONED. WITHOUT SUFFERING ANY
ROMANTIC ALARM, IN THE CONSIDERATION OF THEIR DAUGHTER'S LONG AND LONELY
JOURNEY, MR. AND MRS. MORLAND COULD NOT BUT FEEL THAT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN
PRODUCTIVE OF MUCH UNPLEASANTNESS TO HER; THAT IT WAS WHAT THEY COULD
NEVER HAVE VOLUNTARILY SUFFERED; AND THAT, IN FORCING HER ON SUCH
A MEASURE, GENERAL TILNEY HAD ACTED NEITHER HONOURABLY NOR
FEELINGLY--NEITHER AS A GENTLEMAN NOR AS A PARENT. WHY HE HAD DONE IT,
WHAT COULD HAVE PROVOKED HIM TO SUCH A BREACH OF HOSPITALITY, AND SO
SUDDENLY TURNED ALL HIS PARTIAL REGARD FOR THEIR DAUGHTER INTO ACTUAL
ILL WILL, WAS A MATTER WHICH THEY WERE AT LEAST AS FAR FROM DIVINING
AS CATHERINE HERSELF; BUT IT DID NOT OPPRESS THEM BY ANY MEANS SO LONG;
AND, AFTER A DUE COURSE OF USELESS CONJECTURE, THAT "IT WAS A STRANGE
BUSINESS, AND THAT HE MUST BE A VERY STRANGE MAN," GREW ENOUGH FOR ALL
THEIR INDIGNATION AND WONDER; THOUGH SARAH INDEED STILL INDULGED IN THE
SWEETS OF INCOMPREHENSIBILITY, EXCLAIMING AND CONJECTURING WITH YOUTHFUL
ARDOUR. "MY DEAR, YOU GIVE YOURSELF A GREAT DEAL OF NEEDLESS TROUBLE,"
SAID HER MOTHER AT LAST; "DEPEND UPON IT, IT IS SOMETHING NOT AT ALL
WORTH UNDERSTANDING."

"I CAN ALLOW FOR HIS WISHING CATHERINE AWAY, WHEN HE RECOLLECTED THIS
ENGAGEMENT," SAID SARAH, "BUT WHY NOT DO IT CIVILLY?"

"I AM SORRY FOR THE YOUNG PEOPLE," RETURNED MRS. MORLAND; "THEY MUST
HAVE A SAD TIME OF IT; BUT AS FOR ANYTHING ELSE, IT IS NO MATTER NOW;
CATHERINE IS SAFE AT HOME, AND OUR COMFORT DOES NOT DEPEND UPON GENERAL
TILNEY." CATHERINE SIGHED. "WELL," CONTINUED HER PHILOSOPHIC MOTHER, "I
AM GLAD I DID NOT KNOW OF YOUR JOURNEY AT THE TIME; BUT NOW IT IS ALL
OVER, PERHAPS THERE IS NO GREAT HARM DONE. IT IS ALWAYS GOOD FOR
YOUNG PEOPLE TO BE PUT UPON EXERTING THEMSELVES; AND YOU KNOW, MY DEAR
CATHERINE, YOU ALWAYS WERE A SAD LITTLE SCATTER-BRAINED CREATURE; BUT
NOW YOU MUST HAVE BEEN FORCED TO HAVE YOUR WITS ABOUT YOU, WITH SO MUCH
CHANGING OF CHAISES AND SO FORTH; AND I HOPE IT WILL APPEAR THAT YOU
HAVE NOT LEFT ANYTHING BEHIND YOU IN ANY OF THE POCKETS."

CATHERINE HOPED SO TOO, AND TRIED TO FEEL AN INTEREST IN HER OWN
AMENDMENT, BUT HER SPIRITS WERE QUITE WORN DOWN; AND, TO BE SILENT AND
ALONE BECOMING SOON HER ONLY WISH, SHE READILY AGREED TO HER MOTHER'S
NEXT COUNSEL OF GOING EARLY TO BED. HER PARENTS, SEEING NOTHING IN
HER ILL LOOKS AND AGITATION BUT THE NATURAL CONSEQUENCE OF MORTIFIED
FEELINGS, AND OF THE UNUSUAL EXERTION AND FATIGUE OF SUCH A JOURNEY,
PARTED FROM HER WITHOUT ANY DOUBT OF THEIR BEING SOON SLEPT AWAY; AND
THOUGH, WHEN THEY ALL MET THE NEXT MORNING, HER RECOVERY WAS NOT EQUAL
TO THEIR HOPES, THEY WERE STILL PERFECTLY UNSUSPICIOUS OF THERE BEING
ANY DEEPER EVIL. THEY NEVER ONCE THOUGHT OF HER HEART, WHICH, FOR THE
PARENTS OF A YOUNG LADY OF SEVENTEEN, JUST RETURNED FROM HER FIRST
EXCURSION FROM HOME, WAS ODD ENOUGH!

AS SOON AS BREAKFAST WAS OVER, SHE SAT DOWN TO FULFIL HER PROMISE TO
MISS TILNEY, WHOSE TRUST IN THE EFFECT OF TIME AND DISTANCE ON HER
FRIEND'S DISPOSITION WAS ALREADY JUSTIFIED, FOR ALREADY DID CATHERINE
REPROACH HERSELF WITH HAVING PARTED FROM ELEANOR COLDLY, WITH
HAVING NEVER ENOUGH VALUED HER MERITS OR KINDNESS, AND NEVER ENOUGH
COMMISERATED HER FOR WHAT SHE HAD BEEN YESTERDAY LEFT TO ENDURE. THE
STRENGTH OF THESE FEELINGS, HOWEVER, WAS FAR FROM ASSISTING HER PEN;
AND NEVER HAD IT BEEN HARDER FOR HER TO WRITE THAN IN ADDRESSING ELEANOR
TILNEY. TO COMPOSE A LETTER WHICH MIGHT AT ONCE DO JUSTICE TO HER
SENTIMENTS AND HER SITUATION, CONVEY GRATITUDE WITHOUT SERVILE REGRET,
BE GUARDED WITHOUT COLDNESS, AND HONEST WITHOUT RESENTMENT--A LETTER
WHICH ELEANOR MIGHT NOT BE PAINED BY THE PERUSAL OF--AND, ABOVE ALL,
WHICH SHE MIGHT NOT BLUSH HERSELF, IF HENRY SHOULD CHANCE TO SEE, WAS AN
UNDERTAKING TO FRIGHTEN AWAY ALL HER POWERS OF PERFORMANCE; AND, AFTER
LONG THOUGHT AND MUCH PERPLEXITY, TO BE VERY BRIEF WAS ALL THAT SHE
COULD DETERMINE ON WITH ANY CONFIDENCE OF SAFETY. THE MONEY THEREFORE
WHICH ELEANOR HAD ADVANCED WAS ENCLOSED WITH LITTLE MORE THAN GRATEFUL
THANKS, AND THE THOUSAND GOOD WISHES OF A MOST AFFECTIONATE HEART.

"THIS HAS BEEN A STRANGE ACQUAINTANCE," OBSERVED MRS. MORLAND, AS THE
LETTER WAS FINISHED; "SOON MADE AND SOON ENDED. I AM SORRY IT HAPPENS
SO, FOR MRS. ALLEN THOUGHT THEM VERY PRETTY KIND OF YOUNG PEOPLE; AND
YOU WERE SADLY OUT OF LUCK TOO IN YOUR ISABELLA. AH! POOR JAMES! WELL,
WE MUST LIVE AND LEARN; AND THE NEXT NEW FRIENDS YOU MAKE I HOPE WILL BE
BETTER WORTH KEEPING."

CATHERINE COLOURED AS SHE WARMLY ANSWERED, "NO FRIEND CAN BE BETTER
WORTH KEEPING THAN ELEANOR."

"IF SO, MY DEAR, I DARE SAY YOU WILL MEET AGAIN SOME TIME OR OTHER; DO
NOT BE UNEASY. IT IS TEN TO ONE BUT YOU ARE THROWN TOGETHER AGAIN IN THE
COURSE OF A FEW YEARS; AND THEN WHAT A PLEASURE IT WILL BE!"

MRS. MORLAND WAS NOT HAPPY IN HER ATTEMPT AT CONSOLATION. THE HOPE
OF MEETING AGAIN IN THE COURSE OF A FEW YEARS COULD ONLY PUT INTO
CATHERINE'S HEAD WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN WITHIN THAT TIME TO MAKE A MEETING
DREADFUL TO HER. SHE COULD NEVER FORGET HENRY TILNEY, OR THINK OF HIM
WITH LESS TENDERNESS THAN SHE DID AT THAT MOMENT; BUT HE MIGHT FORGET
HER; AND IN THAT CASE, TO MEET--! HER EYES FILLED WITH TEARS AS SHE
PICTURED HER ACQUAINTANCE SO RENEWED; AND HER MOTHER, PERCEIVING HER
COMFORTABLE SUGGESTIONS TO HAVE HAD NO GOOD EFFECT, PROPOSED, AS ANOTHER
EXPEDIENT FOR RESTORING HER SPIRITS, THAT THEY SHOULD CALL ON MRS.
ALLEN.

THE TWO HOUSES WERE ONLY A QUARTER OF A MILE APART; AND, AS THEY WALKED,
MRS. MORLAND QUICKLY DISPATCHED ALL THAT SHE FELT ON THE SCORE OF
JAMES'S DISAPPOINTMENT. "WE ARE SORRY FOR HIM," SAID SHE; "BUT OTHERWISE
THERE IS NO HARM DONE IN THE MATCH GOING OFF; FOR IT COULD NOT BE
A DESIRABLE THING TO HAVE HIM ENGAGED TO A GIRL WHOM WE HAD NOT THE
SMALLEST ACQUAINTANCE WITH, AND WHO WAS SO ENTIRELY WITHOUT FORTUNE; AND
NOW, AFTER SUCH BEHAVIOUR, WE CANNOT THINK AT ALL WELL OF HER. JUST AT
PRESENT IT COMES HARD TO POOR JAMES; BUT THAT WILL NOT LAST FOREVER; AND
I DARE SAY HE WILL BE A DISCREETER MAN ALL HIS LIFE, FOR THE FOOLISHNESS
OF HIS FIRST CHOICE."

THIS WAS JUST SUCH A SUMMARY VIEW OF THE AFFAIR AS CATHERINE COULD
LISTEN TO; ANOTHER SENTENCE MIGHT HAVE ENDANGERED HER COMPLAISANCE,
AND MADE HER REPLY LESS RATIONAL; FOR SOON WERE ALL HER THINKING POWERS
SWALLOWED UP IN THE REFLECTION OF HER OWN CHANGE OF FEELINGS AND SPIRITS
SINCE LAST SHE HAD TRODDEN THAT WELL-KNOWN ROAD. IT WAS NOT THREE MONTHS
AGO SINCE, WILD WITH JOYFUL EXPECTATION, SHE HAD THERE RUN BACKWARDS
AND FORWARDS SOME TEN TIMES A DAY, WITH AN HEART LIGHT, GAY, AND
INDEPENDENT; LOOKING FORWARD TO PLEASURES UNTASTED AND UNALLOYED, AND
FREE FROM THE APPREHENSION OF EVIL AS FROM THE KNOWLEDGE OF IT. THREE
MONTHS AGO HAD SEEN HER ALL THIS; AND NOW, HOW ALTERED A BEING DID SHE
RETURN!

SHE WAS RECEIVED BY THE ALLENS WITH ALL THE KINDNESS WHICH HER
UNLOOKED-FOR APPEARANCE, ACTING ON A STEADY AFFECTION, WOULD NATURALLY
CALL FORTH; AND GREAT WAS THEIR SURPRISE, AND WARM THEIR DISPLEASURE,
ON HEARING HOW SHE HAD BEEN TREATED--THOUGH MRS. MORLAND'S ACCOUNT OF
IT WAS NO INFLATED REPRESENTATION, NO STUDIED APPEAL TO THEIR PASSIONS.
"CATHERINE TOOK US QUITE BY SURPRISE YESTERDAY EVENING," SAID SHE. "SHE
TRAVELLED ALL THE WAY POST BY HERSELF, AND KNEW NOTHING OF COMING TILL
SATURDAY NIGHT; FOR GENERAL TILNEY, FROM SOME ODD FANCY OR OTHER, ALL
OF A SUDDEN GREW TIRED OF HAVING HER THERE, AND ALMOST TURNED HER OUT
OF THE HOUSE. VERY UNFRIENDLY, CERTAINLY; AND HE MUST BE A VERY ODD
MAN; BUT WE ARE SO GLAD TO HAVE HER AMONGST US AGAIN! AND IT IS A GREAT
COMFORT TO FIND THAT SHE IS NOT A POOR HELPLESS CREATURE, BUT CAN SHIFT
VERY WELL FOR HERSELF."

MR. ALLEN EXPRESSED HIMSELF ON THE OCCASION WITH THE REASONABLE
RESENTMENT OF A SENSIBLE FRIEND; AND MRS. ALLEN THOUGHT HIS EXPRESSIONS
QUITE GOOD ENOUGH TO BE IMMEDIATELY MADE USE OF AGAIN BY HERSELF. HIS
WONDER, HIS CONJECTURES, AND HIS EXPLANATIONS BECAME IN SUCCESSION HERS,
WITH THE ADDITION OF THIS SINGLE REMARK--"I REALLY HAVE NOT PATIENCE
WITH THE GENERAL"--TO FILL UP EVERY ACCIDENTAL PAUSE. AND, "I REALLY
HAVE NOT PATIENCE WITH THE GENERAL," WAS UTTERED TWICE AFTER MR.
ALLEN LEFT THE ROOM, WITHOUT ANY RELAXATION OF ANGER, OR ANY MATERIAL
DIGRESSION OF THOUGHT. A MORE CONSIDERABLE DEGREE OF WANDERING ATTENDED
THE THIRD REPETITION; AND, AFTER COMPLETING THE FOURTH, SHE IMMEDIATELY
ADDED, "ONLY THINK, MY DEAR, OF MY HAVING GOT THAT FRIGHTFUL GREAT RENT
IN MY BEST MECHLIN SO CHARMINGLY MENDED, BEFORE I LEFT BATH, THAT ONE
CAN HARDLY SEE WHERE IT WAS. I MUST SHOW IT YOU SOME DAY OR OTHER. BATH
IS A NICE PLACE, CATHERINE, AFTER ALL. I ASSURE YOU I DID NOT ABOVE HALF
LIKE COMING AWAY. MRS. THORPE'S BEING THERE WAS SUCH A COMFORT TO US,
WAS NOT IT? YOU KNOW, YOU AND I WERE QUITE FORLORN AT FIRST."

"YES, BUT THAT DID NOT LAST LONG," SAID CATHERINE, HER EYES BRIGHTENING
AT THE RECOLLECTION OF WHAT HAD FIRST GIVEN SPIRIT TO HER EXISTENCE
THERE.

"VERY TRUE: WE SOON MET WITH MRS. THORPE, AND THEN WE WANTED FOR
NOTHING. MY DEAR, DO NOT YOU THINK THESE SILK GLOVES WEAR VERY WELL?
I PUT THEM ON NEW THE FIRST TIME OF OUR GOING TO THE LOWER ROOMS, YOU
KNOW, AND I HAVE WORN THEM A GREAT DEAL SINCE. DO YOU REMEMBER THAT
EVENING?"

"DO I! OH! PERFECTLY."

"IT WAS VERY AGREEABLE, WAS NOT IT? MR. TILNEY DRANK TEA WITH US, AND I
ALWAYS THOUGHT HIM A GREAT ADDITION, HE IS SO VERY AGREEABLE. I HAVE A
NOTION YOU DANCED WITH HIM, BUT AM NOT QUITE SURE. I REMEMBER I HAD MY
FAVOURITE GOWN ON."

CATHERINE COULD NOT ANSWER; AND, AFTER A SHORT TRIAL OF OTHER SUBJECTS,
MRS. ALLEN AGAIN RETURNED TO--"I REALLY HAVE NOT PATIENCE WITH THE
GENERAL! SUCH AN AGREEABLE, WORTHY MAN AS HE SEEMED TO BE! I DO NOT
SUPPOSE, MRS. MORLAND, YOU EVER SAW A BETTER-BRED MAN IN YOUR LIFE. HIS
LODGINGS WERE TAKEN THE VERY DAY AFTER HE LEFT THEM, CATHERINE. BUT NO
WONDER; MILSOM STREET, YOU KNOW."

AS THEY WALKED HOME AGAIN, MRS. MORLAND ENDEAVOURED TO IMPRESS ON HER
DAUGHTER'S MIND THE HAPPINESS OF HAVING SUCH STEADY WELL-WISHERS AS MR.
AND MRS. ALLEN, AND THE VERY LITTLE CONSIDERATION WHICH THE NEGLECT OR
UNKINDNESS OF SLIGHT ACQUAINTANCE LIKE THE TILNEYS OUGHT TO HAVE WITH
HER, WHILE SHE COULD PRESERVE THE GOOD OPINION AND AFFECTION OF HER
EARLIEST FRIENDS. THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF GOOD SENSE IN ALL THIS; BUT
THERE ARE SOME SITUATIONS OF THE HUMAN MIND IN WHICH GOOD SENSE HAS
VERY LITTLE POWER; AND CATHERINE'S FEELINGS CONTRADICTED ALMOST EVERY
POSITION HER MOTHER ADVANCED. IT WAS UPON THE BEHAVIOUR OF THESE VERY
SLIGHT ACQUAINTANCE THAT ALL HER PRESENT HAPPINESS DEPENDED; AND
WHILE MRS. MORLAND WAS SUCCESSFULLY CONFIRMING HER OWN OPINIONS BY THE
JUSTNESS OF HER OWN REPRESENTATIONS, CATHERINE WAS SILENTLY REFLECTING
THAT NOW HENRY MUST HAVE ARRIVED AT NORTHANGER; NOW HE MUST HAVE HEARD
OF HER DEPARTURE; AND NOW, PERHAPS, THEY WERE ALL SETTING OFF FOR
HEREFORD.




CHAPTER 30


CATHERINE'S DISPOSITION WAS NOT NATURALLY SEDENTARY, NOR HAD HER HABITS
BEEN EVER VERY INDUSTRIOUS; BUT WHATEVER MIGHT HITHERTO HAVE BEEN HER
DEFECTS OF THAT SORT, HER MOTHER COULD NOT BUT PERCEIVE THEM NOW TO BE
GREATLY INCREASED. SHE COULD NEITHER SIT STILL NOR EMPLOY HERSELF FOR
TEN MINUTES TOGETHER, WALKING ROUND THE GARDEN AND ORCHARD AGAIN AND
AGAIN, AS IF NOTHING BUT MOTION WAS VOLUNTARY; AND IT SEEMED AS IF SHE
COULD EVEN WALK ABOUT THE HOUSE RATHER THAN REMAIN FIXED FOR ANY TIME
IN THE PARLOUR. HER LOSS OF SPIRITS WAS A YET GREATER ALTERATION. IN HER
RAMBLING AND HER IDLENESS SHE MIGHT ONLY BE A CARICATURE OF HERSELF; BUT
IN HER SILENCE AND SADNESS SHE WAS THE VERY REVERSE OF ALL THAT SHE HAD
BEEN BEFORE.

FOR TWO DAYS MRS. MORLAND ALLOWED IT TO PASS EVEN WITHOUT A HINT;
BUT WHEN A THIRD NIGHT'S REST HAD NEITHER RESTORED HER CHEERFULNESS,
IMPROVED HER IN USEFUL ACTIVITY, NOR GIVEN HER A GREATER INCLINATION FOR
NEEDLEWORK, SHE COULD NO LONGER REFRAIN FROM THE GENTLE REPROOF OF, "MY
DEAR CATHERINE, I AM AFRAID YOU ARE GROWING QUITE A FINE LADY. I DO NOT
KNOW WHEN POOR RICHARD'S CRAVATS WOULD BE DONE, IF HE HAD NO FRIEND
BUT YOU. YOUR HEAD RUNS TOO MUCH UPON BATH; BUT THERE IS A TIME FOR
EVERYTHING--A TIME FOR BALLS AND PLAYS, AND A TIME FOR WORK. YOU HAVE
HAD A LONG RUN OF AMUSEMENT, AND NOW YOU MUST TRY TO BE USEFUL."

CATHERINE TOOK UP HER WORK DIRECTLY, SAYING, IN A DEJECTED VOICE, THAT
"HER HEAD DID NOT RUN UPON BATH--MUCH."

"THEN YOU ARE FRETTING ABOUT GENERAL TILNEY, AND THAT IS VERY SIMPLE
OF YOU; FOR TEN TO ONE WHETHER YOU EVER SEE HIM AGAIN. YOU SHOULD NEVER
FRET ABOUT TRIFLES." AFTER A SHORT SILENCE--"I HOPE, MY CATHERINE, YOU
ARE NOT GETTING OUT OF HUMOUR WITH HOME BECAUSE IT IS NOT SO GRAND
AS NORTHANGER. THAT WOULD BE TURNING YOUR VISIT INTO AN EVIL INDEED.
WHEREVER YOU ARE YOU SHOULD ALWAYS BE CONTENTED, BUT ESPECIALLY AT HOME,
BECAUSE THERE YOU MUST SPEND THE MOST OF YOUR TIME. I DID NOT QUITE
LIKE, AT BREAKFAST, TO HEAR YOU TALK SO MUCH ABOUT THE FRENCH BREAD AT
NORTHANGER."

"I AM SURE I DO NOT CARE ABOUT THE BREAD. IT IS ALL THE SAME TO ME WHAT
I EAT."

"THERE IS A VERY CLEVER ESSAY IN ONE OF THE BOOKS UPSTAIRS UPON MUCH
SUCH A SUBJECT, ABOUT YOUNG GIRLS THAT HAVE BEEN SPOILT FOR HOME BY
GREAT ACQUAINTANCE--THE MIRROR, I THINK. I WILL LOOK IT OUT FOR YOU SOME
DAY OR OTHER, BECAUSE I AM SURE IT WILL DO YOU GOOD."

CATHERINE SAID NO MORE, AND, WITH AN ENDEAVOUR TO DO RIGHT, APPLIED
TO HER WORK; BUT, AFTER A FEW MINUTES, SUNK AGAIN, WITHOUT KNOWING IT
HERSELF, INTO LANGUOR AND LISTLESSNESS, MOVING HERSELF IN HER CHAIR,
FROM THE IRRITATION OF WEARINESS, MUCH OFTENER THAN SHE MOVED HER
NEEDLE. MRS. MORLAND WATCHED THE PROGRESS OF THIS RELAPSE; AND SEEING,
IN HER DAUGHTER'S ABSENT AND DISSATISFIED LOOK, THE FULL PROOF OF THAT
REPINING SPIRIT TO WHICH SHE HAD NOW BEGUN TO ATTRIBUTE HER WANT OF
CHEERFULNESS, HASTILY LEFT THE ROOM TO FETCH THE BOOK IN QUESTION,
ANXIOUS TO LOSE NO TIME IN ATTACKING SO DREADFUL A MALADY. IT WAS SOME
TIME BEFORE SHE COULD FIND WHAT SHE LOOKED FOR; AND OTHER FAMILY MATTERS
OCCURRING TO DETAIN HER, A QUARTER OF AN HOUR HAD ELAPSED ERE SHE
RETURNED DOWNSTAIRS WITH THE VOLUME FROM WHICH SO MUCH WAS HOPED. HER
AVOCATIONS ABOVE HAVING SHUT OUT ALL NOISE BUT WHAT SHE CREATED HERSELF,
SHE KNEW NOT THAT A VISITOR HAD ARRIVED WITHIN THE LAST FEW MINUTES,
TILL, ON ENTERING THE ROOM, THE FIRST OBJECT SHE BEHELD WAS A YOUNG
MAN WHOM SHE HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE. WITH A LOOK OF MUCH RESPECT, HE
IMMEDIATELY ROSE, AND BEING INTRODUCED TO HER BY HER CONSCIOUS DAUGHTER
AS "MR. HENRY TILNEY," WITH THE EMBARRASSMENT OF REAL SENSIBILITY BEGAN
TO APOLOGIZE FOR HIS APPEARANCE THERE, ACKNOWLEDGING THAT AFTER WHAT HAD
PASSED HE HAD LITTLE RIGHT TO EXPECT A WELCOME AT FULLERTON, AND STATING
HIS IMPATIENCE TO BE ASSURED OF MISS MORLAND'S HAVING REACHED HER HOME
IN SAFETY, AS THE CAUSE OF HIS INTRUSION. HE DID NOT ADDRESS HIMSELF TO
AN UNCANDID JUDGE OR A RESENTFUL HEART. FAR FROM COMPREHENDING HIM OR
HIS SISTER IN THEIR FATHER'S MISCONDUCT, MRS. MORLAND HAD BEEN ALWAYS
KINDLY DISPOSED TOWARDS EACH, AND INSTANTLY, PLEASED BY HIS APPEARANCE,
RECEIVED HIM WITH THE SIMPLE PROFESSIONS OF UNAFFECTED BENEVOLENCE;
THANKING HIM FOR SUCH AN ATTENTION TO HER DAUGHTER, ASSURING HIM THAT
THE FRIENDS OF HER CHILDREN WERE ALWAYS WELCOME THERE, AND ENTREATING
HIM TO SAY NOT ANOTHER WORD OF THE PAST.

HE WAS NOT ILL-INCLINED TO OBEY THIS REQUEST, FOR, THOUGH HIS HEART WAS
GREATLY RELIEVED BY SUCH UNLOOKED-FOR MILDNESS, IT WAS NOT JUST AT THAT
MOMENT IN HIS POWER TO SAY ANYTHING TO THE PURPOSE. RETURNING IN SILENCE
TO HIS SEAT, THEREFORE, HE REMAINED FOR SOME MINUTES MOST CIVILLY
ANSWERING ALL MRS. MORLAND'S COMMON REMARKS ABOUT THE WEATHER AND
ROADS. CATHERINE MEANWHILE--THE ANXIOUS, AGITATED, HAPPY, FEVERISH
CATHERINE--SAID NOT A WORD; BUT HER GLOWING CHEEK AND BRIGHTENED EYE
MADE HER MOTHER TRUST THAT THIS GOOD-NATURED VISIT WOULD AT LEAST SET
HER HEART AT EASE FOR A TIME, AND GLADLY THEREFORE DID SHE LAY ASIDE THE
FIRST VOLUME OF THE MIRROR FOR A FUTURE HOUR.

DESIROUS OF MR. MORLAND'S ASSISTANCE, AS WELL IN GIVING ENCOURAGEMENT,
AS IN FINDING CONVERSATION FOR HER GUEST, WHOSE EMBARRASSMENT ON HIS
FATHER'S ACCOUNT SHE EARNESTLY PITIED, MRS. MORLAND HAD VERY EARLY
DISPATCHED ONE OF THE CHILDREN TO SUMMON HIM; BUT MR. MORLAND WAS FROM
HOME--AND BEING THUS WITHOUT ANY SUPPORT, AT THE END OF A QUARTER OF
AN HOUR SHE HAD NOTHING TO SAY. AFTER A COUPLE OF MINUTES' UNBROKEN
SILENCE, HENRY, TURNING TO CATHERINE FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE HER
MOTHER'S ENTRANCE, ASKED HER, WITH SUDDEN ALACRITY, IF MR. AND MRS.
ALLEN WERE NOW AT FULLERTON? AND ON DEVELOPING, FROM AMIDST ALL HER
PERPLEXITY OF WORDS IN REPLY, THE MEANING, WHICH ONE SHORT SYLLABLE
WOULD HAVE GIVEN, IMMEDIATELY EXPRESSED HIS INTENTION OF PAYING HIS
RESPECTS TO THEM, AND, WITH A RISING COLOUR, ASKED HER IF SHE WOULD
HAVE THE GOODNESS TO SHOW HIM THE WAY. "YOU MAY SEE THE HOUSE FROM THIS
WINDOW, SIR," WAS INFORMATION ON SARAH'S SIDE, WHICH PRODUCED ONLY A
BOW OF ACKNOWLEDGMENT FROM THE GENTLEMAN, AND A SILENCING NOD FROM
HER MOTHER; FOR MRS. MORLAND, THINKING IT PROBABLE, AS A SECONDARY
CONSIDERATION IN HIS WISH OF WAITING ON THEIR WORTHY NEIGHBOURS, THAT HE
MIGHT HAVE SOME EXPLANATION TO GIVE OF HIS FATHER'S BEHAVIOUR, WHICH IT
MUST BE MORE PLEASANT FOR HIM TO COMMUNICATE ONLY TO CATHERINE, WOULD
NOT ON ANY ACCOUNT PREVENT HER ACCOMPANYING HIM. THEY BEGAN THEIR WALK,
AND MRS. MORLAND WAS NOT ENTIRELY MISTAKEN IN HIS OBJECT IN WISHING IT.
SOME EXPLANATION ON HIS FATHER'S ACCOUNT HE HAD TO GIVE; BUT HIS FIRST
PURPOSE WAS TO EXPLAIN HIMSELF, AND BEFORE THEY REACHED MR. ALLEN'S
GROUNDS HE HAD DONE IT SO WELL THAT CATHERINE DID NOT THINK IT COULD
EVER BE REPEATED TOO OFTEN. SHE WAS ASSURED OF HIS AFFECTION; AND THAT
HEART IN RETURN WAS SOLICITED, WHICH, PERHAPS, THEY PRETTY EQUALLY
KNEW WAS ALREADY ENTIRELY HIS OWN; FOR, THOUGH HENRY WAS NOW SINCERELY
ATTACHED TO HER, THOUGH HE FELT AND DELIGHTED IN ALL THE EXCELLENCIES
OF HER CHARACTER AND TRULY LOVED HER SOCIETY, I MUST CONFESS THAT HIS
AFFECTION ORIGINATED IN NOTHING BETTER THAN GRATITUDE, OR, IN OTHER
WORDS, THAT A PERSUASION OF HER PARTIALITY FOR HIM HAD BEEN THE ONLY
CAUSE OF GIVING HER A SERIOUS THOUGHT. IT IS A NEW CIRCUMSTANCE IN
ROMANCE, I ACKNOWLEDGE, AND DREADFULLY DEROGATORY OF AN HEROINE'S
DIGNITY; BUT IF IT BE AS NEW IN COMMON LIFE, THE CREDIT OF A WILD
IMAGINATION WILL AT LEAST BE ALL MY OWN.

A VERY SHORT VISIT TO MRS. ALLEN, IN WHICH HENRY TALKED AT RANDOM,
WITHOUT SENSE OR CONNECTION, AND CATHERINE, RAPT IN THE CONTEMPLATION OF
HER OWN UNUTTERABLE HAPPINESS, SCARCELY OPENED HER LIPS, DISMISSED THEM
TO THE ECSTASIES OF ANOTHER TETE-A-TETE; AND BEFORE IT WAS SUFFERED TO
CLOSE, SHE WAS ENABLED TO JUDGE HOW FAR HE WAS SANCTIONED BY PARENTAL
AUTHORITY IN HIS PRESENT APPLICATION. ON HIS RETURN FROM WOODSTON, TWO
DAYS BEFORE, HE HAD BEEN MET NEAR THE ABBEY BY HIS IMPATIENT FATHER,
HASTILY INFORMED IN ANGRY TERMS OF MISS MORLAND'S DEPARTURE, AND ORDERED
TO THINK OF HER NO MORE.

SUCH WAS THE PERMISSION UPON WHICH HE HAD NOW OFFERED HER HIS HAND.
THE AFFRIGHTED CATHERINE, AMIDST ALL THE TERRORS OF EXPECTATION, AS SHE
LISTENED TO THIS ACCOUNT, COULD NOT BUT REJOICE IN THE KIND CAUTION
WITH WHICH HENRY HAD SAVED HER FROM THE NECESSITY OF A CONSCIENTIOUS
REJECTION, BY ENGAGING HER FAITH BEFORE HE MENTIONED THE SUBJECT; AND
AS HE PROCEEDED TO GIVE THE PARTICULARS, AND EXPLAIN THE MOTIVES OF
HIS FATHER'S CONDUCT, HER FEELINGS SOON HARDENED INTO EVEN A TRIUMPHANT
DELIGHT. THE GENERAL HAD HAD NOTHING TO ACCUSE HER OF, NOTHING TO LAY
TO HER CHARGE, BUT HER BEING THE INVOLUNTARY, UNCONSCIOUS OBJECT OF A
DECEPTION WHICH HIS PRIDE COULD NOT PARDON, AND WHICH A BETTER PRIDE
WOULD HAVE BEEN ASHAMED TO OWN. SHE WAS GUILTY ONLY OF BEING LESS RICH
THAN HE HAD SUPPOSED HER TO BE. UNDER A MISTAKEN PERSUASION OF HER
POSSESSIONS AND CLAIMS, HE HAD COURTED HER ACQUAINTANCE IN BATH,
SOLICITED HER COMPANY AT NORTHANGER, AND DESIGNED HER FOR HIS
DAUGHTER-IN-LAW. ON DISCOVERING HIS ERROR, TO TURN HER FROM THE HOUSE
SEEMED THE BEST, THOUGH TO HIS FEELINGS AN INADEQUATE PROOF OF HIS
RESENTMENT TOWARDS HERSELF, AND HIS CONTEMPT OF HER FAMILY.

JOHN THORPE HAD FIRST MISLED HIM. THE GENERAL, PERCEIVING HIS SON
ONE NIGHT AT THE THEATRE TO BE PAYING CONSIDERABLE ATTENTION TO MISS
MORLAND, HAD ACCIDENTALLY INQUIRED OF THORPE IF HE KNEW MORE OF HER
THAN HER NAME. THORPE, MOST HAPPY TO BE ON SPEAKING TERMS WITH A MAN
OF GENERAL TILNEY'S IMPORTANCE, HAD BEEN JOYFULLY AND PROUDLY
COMMUNICATIVE; AND BEING AT THAT TIME NOT ONLY IN DAILY EXPECTATION
OF MORLAND'S ENGAGING ISABELLA, BUT LIKEWISE PRETTY WELL RESOLVED UPON
MARRYING CATHERINE HIMSELF, HIS VANITY INDUCED HIM TO REPRESENT THE
FAMILY AS YET MORE WEALTHY THAN HIS VANITY AND AVARICE HAD MADE HIM
BELIEVE THEM. WITH WHOMSOEVER HE WAS, OR WAS LIKELY TO BE CONNECTED, HIS
OWN CONSEQUENCE ALWAYS REQUIRED THAT THEIRS SHOULD BE GREAT, AND AS HIS
INTIMACY WITH ANY ACQUAINTANCE GREW, SO REGULARLY GREW THEIR FORTUNE.
THE EXPECTATIONS OF HIS FRIEND MORLAND, THEREFORE, FROM THE FIRST
OVERRATED, HAD EVER SINCE HIS INTRODUCTION TO ISABELLA BEEN GRADUALLY
INCREASING; AND BY MERELY ADDING TWICE AS MUCH FOR THE GRANDEUR OF THE
MOMENT, BY DOUBLING WHAT HE CHOSE TO THINK THE AMOUNT OF MR. MORLAND'S
PREFERMENT, TREBLING HIS PRIVATE FORTUNE, BESTOWING A RICH AUNT, AND
SINKING HALF THE CHILDREN, HE WAS ABLE TO REPRESENT THE WHOLE FAMILY
TO THE GENERAL IN A MOST RESPECTABLE LIGHT. FOR CATHERINE, HOWEVER, THE
PECULIAR OBJECT OF THE GENERAL'S CURIOSITY, AND HIS OWN SPECULATIONS,
HE HAD YET SOMETHING MORE IN RESERVE, AND THE TEN OR FIFTEEN THOUSAND
POUNDS WHICH HER FATHER COULD GIVE HER WOULD BE A PRETTY ADDITION TO MR.
ALLEN'S ESTATE. HER INTIMACY THERE HAD MADE HIM SERIOUSLY DETERMINE ON
HER BEING HANDSOMELY LEGACIED HEREAFTER; AND TO SPEAK OF HER THEREFORE
AS THE ALMOST ACKNOWLEDGED FUTURE HEIRESS OF FULLERTON NATURALLY
FOLLOWED. UPON SUCH INTELLIGENCE THE GENERAL HAD PROCEEDED; FOR NEVER
HAD IT OCCURRED TO HIM TO DOUBT ITS AUTHORITY. THORPE'S INTEREST IN THE
FAMILY, BY HIS SISTER'S APPROACHING CONNECTION WITH ONE OF ITS MEMBERS,
AND HIS OWN VIEWS ON ANOTHER (CIRCUMSTANCES OF WHICH HE BOASTED WITH
ALMOST EQUAL OPENNESS), SEEMED SUFFICIENT VOUCHERS FOR HIS TRUTH; AND
TO THESE WERE ADDED THE ABSOLUTE FACTS OF THE ALLENS BEING WEALTHY AND
CHILDLESS, OF MISS MORLAND'S BEING UNDER THEIR CARE, AND--AS SOON AS HIS
ACQUAINTANCE ALLOWED HIM TO JUDGE--OF THEIR TREATING HER WITH PARENTAL
KINDNESS. HIS RESOLUTION WAS SOON FORMED. ALREADY HAD HE DISCERNED A
LIKING TOWARDS MISS MORLAND IN THE COUNTENANCE OF HIS SON; AND THANKFUL
FOR MR. THORPE'S COMMUNICATION, HE ALMOST INSTANTLY DETERMINED TO SPARE
NO PAINS IN WEAKENING HIS BOASTED INTEREST AND RUINING HIS DEAREST
HOPES. CATHERINE HERSELF COULD NOT BE MORE IGNORANT AT THE TIME OF ALL
THIS, THAN HIS OWN CHILDREN. HENRY AND ELEANOR, PERCEIVING NOTHING IN
HER SITUATION LIKELY TO ENGAGE THEIR FATHER'S PARTICULAR RESPECT, HAD
SEEN WITH ASTONISHMENT THE SUDDENNESS, CONTINUANCE, AND EXTENT OF HIS
ATTENTION; AND THOUGH LATTERLY, FROM SOME HINTS WHICH HAD ACCOMPANIED AN
ALMOST POSITIVE COMMAND TO HIS SON OF DOING EVERYTHING IN HIS POWER TO
ATTACH HER, HENRY WAS CONVINCED OF HIS FATHER'S BELIEVING IT TO BE
AN ADVANTAGEOUS CONNECTION, IT WAS NOT TILL THE LATE EXPLANATION AT
NORTHANGER THAT THEY HAD THE SMALLEST IDEA OF THE FALSE CALCULATIONS
WHICH HAD HURRIED HIM ON. THAT THEY WERE FALSE, THE GENERAL HAD LEARNT
FROM THE VERY PERSON WHO HAD SUGGESTED THEM, FROM THORPE HIMSELF, WHOM
HE HAD CHANCED TO MEET AGAIN IN TOWN, AND WHO, UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF
EXACTLY OPPOSITE FEELINGS, IRRITATED BY CATHERINE'S REFUSAL, AND
YET MORE BY THE FAILURE OF A VERY RECENT ENDEAVOUR TO ACCOMPLISH A
RECONCILIATION BETWEEN MORLAND AND ISABELLA, CONVINCED THAT THEY WERE
SEPARATED FOREVER, AND SPURNING A FRIENDSHIP WHICH COULD BE NO LONGER
SERVICEABLE, HASTENED TO CONTRADICT ALL THAT HE HAD SAID BEFORE TO
THE ADVANTAGE OF THE MORLANDS--CONFESSED HIMSELF TO HAVE BEEN TOTALLY
MISTAKEN IN HIS OPINION OF THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES AND CHARACTER, MISLED BY
THE RHODOMONTADE OF HIS FRIEND TO BELIEVE HIS FATHER A MAN OF SUBSTANCE
AND CREDIT, WHEREAS THE TRANSACTIONS OF THE TWO OR THREE LAST WEEKS
PROVED HIM TO BE NEITHER; FOR AFTER COMING EAGERLY FORWARD ON THE FIRST
OVERTURE OF A MARRIAGE BETWEEN THE FAMILIES, WITH THE MOST LIBERAL
PROPOSALS, HE HAD, ON BEING BROUGHT TO THE POINT BY THE SHREWDNESS OF
THE RELATOR, BEEN CONSTRAINED TO ACKNOWLEDGE HIMSELF INCAPABLE OF
GIVING THE YOUNG PEOPLE EVEN A DECENT SUPPORT. THEY WERE, IN FACT, A
NECESSITOUS FAMILY; NUMEROUS, TOO, ALMOST BEYOND EXAMPLE; BY NO MEANS
RESPECTED IN THEIR OWN NEIGHBOURHOOD, AS HE HAD LATELY HAD PARTICULAR
OPPORTUNITIES OF DISCOVERING; AIMING AT A STYLE OF LIFE WHICH THEIR
FORTUNE COULD NOT WARRANT; SEEKING TO BETTER THEMSELVES BY WEALTHY
CONNECTIONS; A FORWARD, BRAGGING, SCHEMING RACE.

THE TERRIFIED GENERAL PRONOUNCED THE NAME OF ALLEN WITH AN INQUIRING
LOOK; AND HERE TOO THORPE HAD LEARNT HIS ERROR. THE ALLENS, HE BELIEVED,
HAD LIVED NEAR THEM TOO LONG, AND HE KNEW THE YOUNG MAN ON WHOM THE
FULLERTON ESTATE MUST DEVOLVE. THE GENERAL NEEDED NO MORE. ENRAGED WITH
ALMOST EVERYBODY IN THE WORLD BUT HIMSELF, HE SET OUT THE NEXT DAY FOR
THE ABBEY, WHERE HIS PERFORMANCES HAVE BEEN SEEN.

I LEAVE IT TO MY READER'S SAGACITY TO DETERMINE HOW MUCH OF ALL THIS
IT WAS POSSIBLE FOR HENRY TO COMMUNICATE AT THIS TIME TO CATHERINE, HOW
MUCH OF IT HE COULD HAVE LEARNT FROM HIS FATHER, IN WHAT POINTS HIS OWN
CONJECTURES MIGHT ASSIST HIM, AND WHAT PORTION MUST YET REMAIN TO BE
TOLD IN A LETTER FROM JAMES. I HAVE UNITED FOR THEIR CASE WHAT THEY MUST
DIVIDE FOR MINE. CATHERINE, AT ANY RATE, HEARD ENOUGH TO FEEL THAT IN
SUSPECTING GENERAL TILNEY OF EITHER MURDERING OR SHUTTING UP HIS WIFE,
SHE HAD SCARCELY SINNED AGAINST HIS CHARACTER, OR MAGNIFIED HIS CRUELTY.

HENRY, IN HAVING SUCH THINGS TO RELATE OF HIS FATHER, WAS ALMOST
AS PITIABLE AS IN THEIR FIRST AVOWAL TO HIMSELF. HE BLUSHED FOR THE
NARROW-MINDED COUNSEL WHICH HE WAS OBLIGED TO EXPOSE. THE CONVERSATION
BETWEEN THEM AT NORTHANGER HAD BEEN OF THE MOST UNFRIENDLY KIND. HENRY'S
INDIGNATION ON HEARING HOW CATHERINE HAD BEEN TREATED, ON COMPREHENDING
HIS FATHER'S VIEWS, AND BEING ORDERED TO ACQUIESCE IN THEM, HAD BEEN
OPEN AND BOLD. THE GENERAL, ACCUSTOMED ON EVERY ORDINARY OCCASION TO
GIVE THE LAW IN HIS FAMILY, PREPARED FOR NO RELUCTANCE BUT OF FEELING,
NO OPPOSING DESIRE THAT SHOULD DARE TO CLOTHE ITSELF IN WORDS, COULD ILL
BROOK THE OPPOSITION OF HIS SON, STEADY AS THE SANCTION OF REASON AND
THE DICTATE OF CONSCIENCE COULD MAKE IT. BUT, IN SUCH A CAUSE, HIS
ANGER, THOUGH IT MUST SHOCK, COULD NOT INTIMIDATE HENRY, WHO WAS
SUSTAINED IN HIS PURPOSE BY A CONVICTION OF ITS JUSTICE. HE FELT HIMSELF
BOUND AS MUCH IN HONOUR AS IN AFFECTION TO MISS MORLAND, AND BELIEVING
THAT HEART TO BE HIS OWN WHICH HE HAD BEEN DIRECTED TO GAIN, NO UNWORTHY
RETRACTION OF A TACIT CONSENT, NO REVERSING DECREE OF UNJUSTIFIABLE
ANGER, COULD SHAKE HIS FIDELITY, OR INFLUENCE THE RESOLUTIONS IT
PROMPTED.

HE STEADILY REFUSED TO ACCOMPANY HIS FATHER INTO HEREFORDSHIRE, AN
ENGAGEMENT FORMED ALMOST AT THE MOMENT TO PROMOTE THE DISMISSAL OF
CATHERINE, AND AS STEADILY DECLARED HIS INTENTION OF OFFERING HER HIS
HAND. THE GENERAL WAS FURIOUS IN HIS ANGER, AND THEY PARTED IN DREADFUL
DISAGREEMENT. HENRY, IN AN AGITATION OF MIND WHICH MANY SOLITARY HOURS
WERE REQUIRED TO COMPOSE, HAD RETURNED ALMOST INSTANTLY TO WOODSTON,
AND, ON THE AFTERNOON OF THE FOLLOWING DAY, HAD BEGUN HIS JOURNEY TO
FULLERTON.




CHAPTER 31


MR. AND MRS. MORLAND'S SURPRISE ON BEING APPLIED TO BY MR. TILNEY FOR
THEIR CONSENT TO HIS MARRYING THEIR DAUGHTER WAS, FOR A FEW MINUTES,
CONSIDERABLE, IT HAVING NEVER ENTERED THEIR HEADS TO SUSPECT AN
ATTACHMENT ON EITHER SIDE; BUT AS NOTHING, AFTER ALL, COULD BE MORE
NATURAL THAN CATHERINE'S BEING BELOVED, THEY SOON LEARNT TO CONSIDER IT
WITH ONLY THE HAPPY AGITATION OF GRATIFIED PRIDE, AND, AS FAR AS THEY
ALONE WERE CONCERNED, HAD NOT A SINGLE OBJECTION TO START. HIS PLEASING
MANNERS AND GOOD SENSE WERE SELF-EVIDENT RECOMMENDATIONS; AND HAVING
NEVER HEARD EVIL OF HIM, IT WAS NOT THEIR WAY TO SUPPOSE ANY EVIL COULD
BE TOLD. GOODWILL SUPPLYING THE PLACE OF EXPERIENCE, HIS CHARACTER
NEEDED NO ATTESTATION. "CATHERINE WOULD MAKE A SAD, HEEDLESS YOUNG
HOUSEKEEPER TO BE SURE," WAS HER MOTHER'S FOREBODING REMARK; BUT QUICK
WAS THE CONSOLATION OF THERE BEING NOTHING LIKE PRACTICE.

THERE WAS BUT ONE OBSTACLE, IN SHORT, TO BE MENTIONED; BUT TILL THAT ONE
WAS REMOVED, IT MUST BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM TO SANCTION THE ENGAGEMENT.
THEIR TEMPERS WERE MILD, BUT THEIR PRINCIPLES WERE STEADY, AND WHILE
HIS PARENT SO EXPRESSLY FORBADE THE CONNECTION, THEY COULD NOT ALLOW
THEMSELVES TO ENCOURAGE IT. THAT THE GENERAL SHOULD COME FORWARD TO
SOLICIT THE ALLIANCE, OR THAT HE SHOULD EVEN VERY HEARTILY APPROVE IT,
THEY WERE NOT REFINED ENOUGH TO MAKE ANY PARADING STIPULATION; BUT
THE DECENT APPEARANCE OF CONSENT MUST BE YIELDED, AND THAT ONCE
OBTAINED--AND THEIR OWN HEARTS MADE THEM TRUST THAT IT COULD NOT BE
VERY LONG DENIED--THEIR WILLING APPROBATION WAS INSTANTLY TO FOLLOW. HIS
CONSENT WAS ALL THAT THEY WISHED FOR. THEY WERE NO MORE INCLINED THAN
ENTITLED TO DEMAND HIS MONEY. OF A VERY CONSIDERABLE FORTUNE, HIS SON
WAS, BY MARRIAGE SETTLEMENTS, EVENTUALLY SECURE; HIS PRESENT INCOME WAS
AN INCOME OF INDEPENDENCE AND COMFORT, AND UNDER EVERY PECUNIARY VIEW,
IT WAS A MATCH BEYOND THE CLAIMS OF THEIR DAUGHTER.

THE YOUNG PEOPLE COULD NOT BE SURPRISED AT A DECISION LIKE THIS. THEY
FELT AND THEY DEPLORED--BUT THEY COULD NOT RESENT IT; AND THEY PARTED,
ENDEAVOURING TO HOPE THAT SUCH A CHANGE IN THE GENERAL, AS EACH BELIEVED
ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE, MIGHT SPEEDILY TAKE PLACE, TO UNITE THEM AGAIN IN
THE FULLNESS OF PRIVILEGED AFFECTION. HENRY RETURNED TO WHAT WAS NOW
HIS ONLY HOME, TO WATCH OVER HIS YOUNG PLANTATIONS, AND EXTEND HIS
IMPROVEMENTS FOR HER SAKE, TO WHOSE SHARE IN THEM HE LOOKED ANXIOUSLY
FORWARD; AND CATHERINE REMAINED AT FULLERTON TO CRY. WHETHER THE
TORMENTS OF ABSENCE WERE SOFTENED BY A CLANDESTINE CORRESPONDENCE, LET
US NOT INQUIRE. MR. AND MRS. MORLAND NEVER DID--THEY HAD BEEN TOO KIND
TO EXACT ANY PROMISE; AND WHENEVER CATHERINE RECEIVED A LETTER, AS, AT
THAT TIME, HAPPENED PRETTY OFTEN, THEY ALWAYS LOOKED ANOTHER WAY.

THE ANXIETY, WHICH IN THIS STATE OF THEIR ATTACHMENT MUST BE THE PORTION
OF HENRY AND CATHERINE, AND OF ALL WHO LOVED EITHER, AS TO ITS FINAL
EVENT, CAN HARDLY EXTEND, I FEAR, TO THE BOSOM OF MY READERS, WHO WILL
SEE IN THE TELL-TALE COMPRESSION OF THE PAGES BEFORE THEM, THAT WE ARE
ALL HASTENING TOGETHER TO PERFECT FELICITY. THE MEANS BY WHICH THEIR
EARLY MARRIAGE WAS EFFECTED CAN BE THE ONLY DOUBT: WHAT PROBABLE
CIRCUMSTANCE COULD WORK UPON A TEMPER LIKE THE GENERAL'S? THE
CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH CHIEFLY AVAILED WAS THE MARRIAGE OF HIS DAUGHTER WITH
A MAN OF FORTUNE AND CONSEQUENCE, WHICH TOOK PLACE IN THE COURSE OF
THE SUMMER--AN ACCESSION OF DIGNITY THAT THREW HIM INTO A FIT OF GOOD
HUMOUR, FROM WHICH HE DID NOT RECOVER TILL AFTER ELEANOR HAD OBTAINED
HIS FORGIVENESS OF HENRY, AND HIS PERMISSION FOR HIM "TO BE A FOOL IF HE
LIKED IT!"

THE MARRIAGE OF ELEANOR TILNEY, HER REMOVAL FROM ALL THE EVILS OF SUCH
A HOME AS NORTHANGER HAD BEEN MADE BY HENRY'S BANISHMENT, TO THE HOME OF
HER CHOICE AND THE MAN OF HER CHOICE, IS AN EVENT WHICH I EXPECT TO
GIVE GENERAL SATISFACTION AMONG ALL HER ACQUAINTANCE. MY OWN JOY ON THE
OCCASION IS VERY SINCERE. I KNOW NO ONE MORE ENTITLED, BY UNPRETENDING
MERIT, OR BETTER PREPARED BY HABITUAL SUFFERING, TO RECEIVE AND ENJOY
FELICITY. HER PARTIALITY FOR THIS GENTLEMAN WAS NOT OF RECENT ORIGIN;
AND HE HAD BEEN LONG WITHHELD ONLY BY INFERIORITY OF SITUATION FROM
ADDRESSING HER. HIS UNEXPECTED ACCESSION TO TITLE AND FORTUNE HAD
REMOVED ALL HIS DIFFICULTIES; AND NEVER HAD THE GENERAL LOVED HIS
DAUGHTER SO WELL IN ALL HER HOURS OF COMPANIONSHIP, UTILITY, AND PATIENT
ENDURANCE AS WHEN HE FIRST HAILED HER "YOUR LADYSHIP!" HER HUSBAND WAS
REALLY DESERVING OF HER; INDEPENDENT OF HIS PEERAGE, HIS WEALTH, AND
HIS ATTACHMENT, BEING TO A PRECISION THE MOST CHARMING YOUNG MAN IN THE
WORLD. ANY FURTHER DEFINITION OF HIS MERITS MUST BE UNNECESSARY; THE
MOST CHARMING YOUNG MAN IN THE WORLD IS INSTANTLY BEFORE THE IMAGINATION
OF US ALL. CONCERNING THE ONE IN QUESTION, THEREFORE, I HAVE ONLY TO
ADD--AWARE THAT THE RULES OF COMPOSITION FORBID THE INTRODUCTION OF A
CHARACTER NOT CONNECTED WITH MY FABLE--THAT THIS WAS THE VERY
GENTLEMAN WHOSE NEGLIGENT SERVANT LEFT BEHIND HIM THAT COLLECTION OF
WASHING-BILLS, RESULTING FROM A LONG VISIT AT NORTHANGER, BY WHICH MY
HEROINE WAS INVOLVED IN ONE OF HER MOST ALARMING ADVENTURES.

THE INFLUENCE OF THE VISCOUNT AND VISCOUNTESS IN THEIR BROTHER'S BEHALF
WAS ASSISTED BY THAT RIGHT UNDERSTANDING OF MR. MORLAND'S CIRCUMSTANCES
WHICH, AS SOON AS THE GENERAL WOULD ALLOW HIMSELF TO BE INFORMED, THEY
WERE QUALIFIED TO GIVE. IT TAUGHT HIM THAT HE HAD BEEN SCARCELY
MORE MISLED BY THORPE'S FIRST BOAST OF THE FAMILY WEALTH THAN BY HIS
SUBSEQUENT MALICIOUS OVERTHROW OF IT; THAT IN NO SENSE OF THE WORD WERE
THEY NECESSITOUS OR POOR, AND THAT CATHERINE WOULD HAVE THREE THOUSAND
POUNDS. THIS WAS SO MATERIAL AN AMENDMENT OF HIS LATE EXPECTATIONS THAT
IT GREATLY CONTRIBUTED TO SMOOTH THE DESCENT OF HIS PRIDE; AND BY NO
MEANS WITHOUT ITS EFFECT WAS THE PRIVATE INTELLIGENCE, WHICH HE WAS AT
SOME PAINS TO PROCURE, THAT THE FULLERTON ESTATE, BEING ENTIRELY AT
THE DISPOSAL OF ITS PRESENT PROPRIETOR, WAS CONSEQUENTLY OPEN TO EVERY
GREEDY SPECULATION.

ON THE STRENGTH OF THIS, THE GENERAL, SOON AFTER ELEANOR'S MARRIAGE,
PERMITTED HIS SON TO RETURN TO NORTHANGER, AND THENCE MADE HIM THE
BEARER OF HIS CONSENT, VERY COURTEOUSLY WORDED IN A PAGE FULL OF EMPTY
PROFESSIONS TO MR. MORLAND. THE EVENT WHICH IT AUTHORIZED SOON FOLLOWED:
HENRY AND CATHERINE WERE MARRIED, THE BELLS RANG, AND EVERYBODY SMILED;
AND, AS THIS TOOK PLACE WITHIN A TWELVEMONTH FROM THE FIRST DAY OF THEIR
MEETING, IT WILL NOT APPEAR, AFTER ALL THE DREADFUL DELAYS OCCASIONED BY
THE GENERAL'S CRUELTY, THAT THEY WERE ESSENTIALLY HURT BY IT. TO BEGIN
PERFECT HAPPINESS AT THE RESPECTIVE AGES OF TWENTY-SIX AND EIGHTEEN IS
TO DO PRETTY WELL; AND PROFESSING MYSELF MOREOVER CONVINCED THAT THE
GENERAL'S UNJUST INTERFERENCE, SO FAR FROM BEING REALLY INJURIOUS TO
THEIR FELICITY, WAS PERHAPS RATHER CONDUCIVE TO IT, BY IMPROVING THEIR
KNOWLEDGE OF EACH OTHER, AND ADDING STRENGTH TO THEIR ATTACHMENT,
I LEAVE IT TO BE SETTLED, BY WHOMSOEVER IT MAY CONCERN, WHETHER THE
TENDENCY OF THIS WORK BE ALTOGETHER TO RECOMMEND PARENTAL TYRANNY, OR
REWARD FILIAL DISOBEDIENCE.

MANSFIELD PARK

(1814)


BY JANE AUSTEN




CHAPTER I

ABOUT THIRTY YEARS AGO MISS MARIA WARD, OF HUNTINGDON, WITH ONLY SEVEN
THOUSAND POUNDS, HAD THE GOOD LUCK TO CAPTIVATE SIR THOMAS BERTRAM, OF
MANSFIELD PARK, IN THE COUNTY OF NORTHAMPTON, AND TO BE THEREBY RAISED
TO THE RANK OF A BARONET'S LADY, WITH ALL THE COMFORTS AND CONSEQUENCES
OF AN HANDSOME HOUSE AND LARGE INCOME. ALL HUNTINGDON EXCLAIMED ON THE
GREATNESS OF THE MATCH, AND HER UNCLE, THE LAWYER, HIMSELF, ALLOWED HER
TO BE AT LEAST THREE THOUSAND POUNDS SHORT OF ANY EQUITABLE CLAIM TO IT.
SHE HAD TWO SISTERS TO BE BENEFITED BY HER ELEVATION; AND SUCH OF THEIR
ACQUAINTANCE AS THOUGHT MISS WARD AND MISS FRANCES QUITE AS HANDSOME AS
MISS MARIA, DID NOT SCRUPLE TO PREDICT THEIR MARRYING WITH ALMOST EQUAL
ADVANTAGE. BUT THERE CERTAINLY ARE NOT SO MANY MEN OF LARGE FORTUNE IN
THE WORLD AS THERE ARE PRETTY WOMEN TO DESERVE THEM. MISS WARD, AT THE
END OF HALF A DOZEN YEARS, FOUND HERSELF OBLIGED TO BE ATTACHED TO
THE REV. MR. NORRIS, A FRIEND OF HER BROTHER-IN-LAW, WITH SCARCELY ANY
PRIVATE FORTUNE, AND MISS FRANCES FARED YET WORSE. MISS WARD'S MATCH,
INDEED, WHEN IT CAME TO THE POINT, WAS NOT CONTEMPTIBLE: SIR THOMAS
BEING HAPPILY ABLE TO GIVE HIS FRIEND AN INCOME IN THE LIVING OF
MANSFIELD; AND MR. AND MRS. NORRIS BEGAN THEIR CAREER OF CONJUGAL
FELICITY WITH VERY LITTLE LESS THAN A THOUSAND A YEAR. BUT MISS FRANCES
MARRIED, IN THE COMMON PHRASE, TO DISOBLIGE HER FAMILY, AND BY FIXING ON
A LIEUTENANT OF MARINES, WITHOUT EDUCATION, FORTUNE, OR CONNEXIONS, DID
IT VERY THOROUGHLY. SHE COULD HARDLY HAVE MADE A MORE UNTOWARD CHOICE.
SIR THOMAS BERTRAM HAD INTEREST, WHICH, FROM PRINCIPLE AS WELL AS
PRIDE--FROM A GENERAL WISH OF DOING RIGHT, AND A DESIRE OF SEEING ALL
THAT WERE CONNECTED WITH HIM IN SITUATIONS OF RESPECTABILITY, HE WOULD
HAVE BEEN GLAD TO EXERT FOR THE ADVANTAGE OF LADY BERTRAM'S SISTER; BUT
HER HUSBAND'S PROFESSION WAS SUCH AS NO INTEREST COULD REACH; AND BEFORE
HE HAD TIME TO DEVISE ANY OTHER METHOD OF ASSISTING THEM, AN ABSOLUTE
BREACH BETWEEN THE SISTERS HAD TAKEN PLACE. IT WAS THE NATURAL RESULT OF
THE CONDUCT OF EACH PARTY, AND SUCH AS A VERY IMPRUDENT MARRIAGE ALMOST
ALWAYS PRODUCES. TO SAVE HERSELF FROM USELESS REMONSTRANCE, MRS. PRICE
NEVER WROTE TO HER FAMILY ON THE SUBJECT TILL ACTUALLY MARRIED. LADY
BERTRAM, WHO WAS A WOMAN OF VERY TRANQUIL FEELINGS, AND A TEMPER
REMARKABLY EASY AND INDOLENT, WOULD HAVE CONTENTED HERSELF WITH MERELY
GIVING UP HER SISTER, AND THINKING NO MORE OF THE MATTER; BUT MRS.
NORRIS HAD A SPIRIT OF ACTIVITY, WHICH COULD NOT BE SATISFIED TILL SHE
HAD WRITTEN A LONG AND ANGRY LETTER TO FANNY, TO POINT OUT THE FOLLY OF
HER CONDUCT, AND THREATEN HER WITH ALL ITS POSSIBLE ILL CONSEQUENCES.
MRS. PRICE, IN HER TURN, WAS INJURED AND ANGRY; AND AN ANSWER, WHICH
COMPREHENDED EACH SISTER IN ITS BITTERNESS, AND BESTOWED SUCH VERY
DISRESPECTFUL REFLECTIONS ON THE PRIDE OF SIR THOMAS AS MRS. NORRIS
COULD NOT POSSIBLY KEEP TO HERSELF, PUT AN END TO ALL INTERCOURSE
BETWEEN THEM FOR A CONSIDERABLE PERIOD.

THEIR HOMES WERE SO DISTANT, AND THE CIRCLES IN WHICH THEY MOVED SO
DISTINCT, AS ALMOST TO PRECLUDE THE MEANS OF EVER HEARING OF EACH
OTHER'S EXISTENCE DURING THE ELEVEN FOLLOWING YEARS, OR, AT LEAST, TO
MAKE IT VERY WONDERFUL TO SIR THOMAS THAT MRS. NORRIS SHOULD EVER HAVE
IT IN HER POWER TO TELL THEM, AS SHE NOW AND THEN DID, IN AN ANGRY
VOICE, THAT FANNY HAD GOT ANOTHER CHILD. BY THE END OF ELEVEN YEARS,
HOWEVER, MRS. PRICE COULD NO LONGER AFFORD TO CHERISH PRIDE OR
RESENTMENT, OR TO LOSE ONE CONNEXION THAT MIGHT POSSIBLY ASSIST HER.
A LARGE AND STILL INCREASING FAMILY, AN HUSBAND DISABLED FOR ACTIVE
SERVICE, BUT NOT THE LESS EQUAL TO COMPANY AND GOOD LIQUOR, AND A VERY
SMALL INCOME TO SUPPLY THEIR WANTS, MADE HER EAGER TO REGAIN THE FRIENDS
SHE HAD SO CARELESSLY SACRIFICED; AND SHE ADDRESSED LADY BERTRAM IN
A LETTER WHICH SPOKE SO MUCH CONTRITION AND DESPONDENCE, SUCH A
SUPERFLUITY OF CHILDREN, AND SUCH A WANT OF ALMOST EVERYTHING ELSE, AS
COULD NOT BUT DISPOSE THEM ALL TO A RECONCILIATION. SHE WAS PREPARING
FOR HER NINTH LYING-IN; AND AFTER BEWAILING THE CIRCUMSTANCE, AND
IMPLORING THEIR COUNTENANCE AS SPONSORS TO THE EXPECTED CHILD, SHE
COULD NOT CONCEAL HOW IMPORTANT SHE FELT THEY MIGHT BE TO THE FUTURE
MAINTENANCE OF THE EIGHT ALREADY IN BEING. HER ELDEST WAS A BOY OF TEN
YEARS OLD, A FINE SPIRITED FELLOW, WHO LONGED TO BE OUT IN THE WORLD;
BUT WHAT COULD SHE DO? WAS THERE ANY CHANCE OF HIS BEING HEREAFTER
USEFUL TO SIR THOMAS IN THE CONCERNS OF HIS WEST INDIAN PROPERTY?
NO SITUATION WOULD BE BENEATH HIM; OR WHAT DID SIR THOMAS THINK OF
WOOLWICH? OR HOW COULD A BOY BE SENT OUT TO THE EAST?

THE LETTER WAS NOT UNPRODUCTIVE. IT RE-ESTABLISHED PEACE AND KINDNESS.
SIR THOMAS SENT FRIENDLY ADVICE AND PROFESSIONS, LADY BERTRAM DISPATCHED
MONEY AND BABY-LINEN, AND MRS. NORRIS WROTE THE LETTERS.

SUCH WERE ITS IMMEDIATE EFFECTS, AND WITHIN A TWELVEMONTH A MORE
IMPORTANT ADVANTAGE TO MRS. PRICE RESULTED FROM IT. MRS. NORRIS WAS
OFTEN OBSERVING TO THE OTHERS THAT SHE COULD NOT GET HER POOR SISTER AND
HER FAMILY OUT OF HER HEAD, AND THAT, MUCH AS THEY HAD ALL DONE FOR HER,
SHE SEEMED TO BE WANTING TO DO MORE; AND AT LENGTH SHE COULD NOT BUT
OWN IT TO BE HER WISH THAT POOR MRS. PRICE SHOULD BE RELIEVED FROM THE
CHARGE AND EXPENSE OF ONE CHILD ENTIRELY OUT OF HER GREAT NUMBER. "WHAT
IF THEY WERE AMONG THEM TO UNDERTAKE THE CARE OF HER ELDEST DAUGHTER,
A GIRL NOW NINE YEARS OLD, OF AN AGE TO REQUIRE MORE ATTENTION THAN HER
POOR MOTHER COULD POSSIBLY GIVE? THE TROUBLE AND EXPENSE OF IT TO THEM
WOULD BE NOTHING, COMPARED WITH THE BENEVOLENCE OF THE ACTION." LADY
BERTRAM AGREED WITH HER INSTANTLY. "I THINK WE CANNOT DO BETTER," SAID
SHE; "LET US SEND FOR THE CHILD."

SIR THOMAS COULD NOT GIVE SO INSTANTANEOUS AND UNQUALIFIED A CONSENT. HE
DEBATED AND HESITATED;--IT WAS A SERIOUS CHARGE;--A GIRL SO BROUGHT UP
MUST BE ADEQUATELY PROVIDED FOR, OR THERE WOULD BE CRUELTY INSTEAD
OF KINDNESS IN TAKING HER FROM HER FAMILY. HE THOUGHT OF HIS OWN FOUR
CHILDREN, OF HIS TWO SONS, OF COUSINS IN LOVE, ETC.;--BUT NO SOONER
HAD HE DELIBERATELY BEGUN TO STATE HIS OBJECTIONS, THAN MRS. NORRIS
INTERRUPTED HIM WITH A REPLY TO THEM ALL, WHETHER STATED OR NOT.

"MY DEAR SIR THOMAS, I PERFECTLY COMPREHEND YOU, AND DO JUSTICE TO THE
GENEROSITY AND DELICACY OF YOUR NOTIONS, WHICH INDEED ARE QUITE OF A
PIECE WITH YOUR GENERAL CONDUCT; AND I ENTIRELY AGREE WITH YOU IN
THE MAIN AS TO THE PROPRIETY OF DOING EVERYTHING ONE COULD BY WAY OF
PROVIDING FOR A CHILD ONE HAD IN A MANNER TAKEN INTO ONE'S OWN HANDS;
AND I AM SURE I SHOULD BE THE LAST PERSON IN THE WORLD TO WITHHOLD MY
MITE UPON SUCH AN OCCASION. HAVING NO CHILDREN OF MY OWN, WHO SHOULD I
LOOK TO IN ANY LITTLE MATTER I MAY EVER HAVE TO BESTOW, BUT THE CHILDREN
OF MY SISTERS?--AND I AM SURE MR. NORRIS IS TOO JUST--BUT YOU KNOW I AM
A WOMAN OF FEW WORDS AND PROFESSIONS. DO NOT LET US BE FRIGHTENED FROM
A GOOD DEED BY A TRIFLE. GIVE A GIRL AN EDUCATION, AND INTRODUCE
HER PROPERLY INTO THE WORLD, AND TEN TO ONE BUT SHE HAS THE MEANS OF
SETTLING WELL, WITHOUT FARTHER EXPENSE TO ANYBODY. A NIECE OF OURS, SIR
THOMAS, I MAY SAY, OR AT LEAST OF YOURS, WOULD NOT GROW UP IN THIS
NEIGHBOURHOOD WITHOUT MANY ADVANTAGES. I DON'T SAY SHE WOULD BE SO
HANDSOME AS HER COUSINS. I DARE SAY SHE WOULD NOT; BUT SHE WOULD BE
INTRODUCED INTO THE SOCIETY OF THIS COUNTRY UNDER SUCH VERY FAVOURABLE
CIRCUMSTANCES AS, IN ALL HUMAN PROBABILITY, WOULD GET HER A CREDITABLE
ESTABLISHMENT. YOU ARE THINKING OF YOUR SONS--BUT DO NOT YOU KNOW THAT,
OF ALL THINGS UPON EARTH, THAT IS THE LEAST LIKELY TO HAPPEN, BROUGHT
UP AS THEY WOULD BE, ALWAYS TOGETHER LIKE BROTHERS AND SISTERS? IT IS
MORALLY IMPOSSIBLE. I NEVER KNEW AN INSTANCE OF IT. IT IS, IN FACT, THE
ONLY SURE WAY OF PROVIDING AGAINST THE CONNEXION. SUPPOSE HER A PRETTY
GIRL, AND SEEN BY TOM OR EDMUND FOR THE FIRST TIME SEVEN YEARS HENCE,
AND I DARE SAY THERE WOULD BE MISCHIEF. THE VERY IDEA OF HER HAVING BEEN
SUFFERED TO GROW UP AT A DISTANCE FROM US ALL IN POVERTY AND NEGLECT,
WOULD BE ENOUGH TO MAKE EITHER OF THE DEAR, SWEET-TEMPERED BOYS IN LOVE
WITH HER. BUT BREED HER UP WITH THEM FROM THIS TIME, AND SUPPOSE HER
EVEN TO HAVE THE BEAUTY OF AN ANGEL, AND SHE WILL NEVER BE MORE TO
EITHER THAN A SISTER."

"THERE IS A GREAT DEAL OF TRUTH IN WHAT YOU SAY," REPLIED SIR THOMAS,
"AND FAR BE IT FROM ME TO THROW ANY FANCIFUL IMPEDIMENT IN THE WAY OF A
PLAN WHICH WOULD BE SO CONSISTENT WITH THE RELATIVE SITUATIONS OF EACH.
I ONLY MEANT TO OBSERVE THAT IT OUGHT NOT TO BE LIGHTLY ENGAGED IN,
AND THAT TO MAKE IT REALLY SERVICEABLE TO MRS. PRICE, AND CREDITABLE TO
OURSELVES, WE MUST SECURE TO THE CHILD, OR CONSIDER OURSELVES ENGAGED TO
SECURE TO HER HEREAFTER, AS CIRCUMSTANCES MAY ARISE, THE PROVISION OF
A GENTLEWOMAN, IF NO SUCH ESTABLISHMENT SHOULD OFFER AS YOU ARE SO
SANGUINE IN EXPECTING."

"I THOROUGHLY UNDERSTAND YOU," CRIED MRS. NORRIS, "YOU ARE EVERYTHING
THAT IS GENEROUS AND CONSIDERATE, AND I AM SURE WE SHALL NEVER DISAGREE
ON THIS POINT. WHATEVER I CAN DO, AS YOU WELL KNOW, I AM ALWAYS READY
ENOUGH TO DO FOR THE GOOD OF THOSE I LOVE; AND, THOUGH I COULD NEVER
FEEL FOR THIS LITTLE GIRL THE HUNDREDTH PART OF THE REGARD I BEAR YOUR
OWN DEAR CHILDREN, NOR CONSIDER HER, IN ANY RESPECT, SO MUCH MY OWN,
I SHOULD HATE MYSELF IF I WERE CAPABLE OF NEGLECTING HER. IS NOT SHE A
SISTER'S CHILD? AND COULD I BEAR TO SEE HER WANT WHILE I HAD A BIT OF
BREAD TO GIVE HER? MY DEAR SIR THOMAS, WITH ALL MY FAULTS I HAVE A WARM
HEART; AND, POOR AS I AM, WOULD RATHER DENY MYSELF THE NECESSARIES OF
LIFE THAN DO AN UNGENEROUS THING. SO, IF YOU ARE NOT AGAINST IT, I WILL
WRITE TO MY POOR SISTER TOMORROW, AND MAKE THE PROPOSAL; AND, AS SOON
AS MATTERS ARE SETTLED, I WILL ENGAGE TO GET THE CHILD TO MANSFIELD;
YOU SHALL HAVE NO TROUBLE ABOUT IT. MY OWN TROUBLE, YOU KNOW, I NEVER
REGARD. I WILL SEND NANNY TO LONDON ON PURPOSE, AND SHE MAY HAVE A BED
AT HER COUSIN THE SADDLER'S, AND THE CHILD BE APPOINTED TO MEET HER
THERE. THEY MAY EASILY GET HER FROM PORTSMOUTH TO TOWN BY THE COACH,
UNDER THE CARE OF ANY CREDITABLE PERSON THAT MAY CHANCE TO BE GOING. I
DARE SAY THERE IS ALWAYS SOME REPUTABLE TRADESMAN'S WIFE OR OTHER GOING
UP."

EXCEPT TO THE ATTACK ON NANNY'S COUSIN, SIR THOMAS NO LONGER MADE ANY
OBJECTION, AND A MORE RESPECTABLE, THOUGH LESS ECONOMICAL RENDEZVOUS
BEING ACCORDINGLY SUBSTITUTED, EVERYTHING WAS CONSIDERED AS SETTLED,
AND THE PLEASURES OF SO BENEVOLENT A SCHEME WERE ALREADY ENJOYED. THE
DIVISION OF GRATIFYING SENSATIONS OUGHT NOT, IN STRICT JUSTICE, TO
HAVE BEEN EQUAL; FOR SIR THOMAS WAS FULLY RESOLVED TO BE THE REAL AND
CONSISTENT PATRON OF THE SELECTED CHILD, AND MRS. NORRIS HAD NOT THE
LEAST INTENTION OF BEING AT ANY EXPENSE WHATEVER IN HER MAINTENANCE.
AS FAR AS WALKING, TALKING, AND CONTRIVING REACHED, SHE WAS THOROUGHLY
BENEVOLENT, AND NOBODY KNEW BETTER HOW TO DICTATE LIBERALITY TO OTHERS;
BUT HER LOVE OF MONEY WAS EQUAL TO HER LOVE OF DIRECTING, AND SHE KNEW
QUITE AS WELL HOW TO SAVE HER OWN AS TO SPEND THAT OF HER FRIENDS.
HAVING MARRIED ON A NARROWER INCOME THAN SHE HAD BEEN USED TO LOOK
FORWARD TO, SHE HAD, FROM THE FIRST, FANCIED A VERY STRICT LINE OF
ECONOMY NECESSARY; AND WHAT WAS BEGUN AS A MATTER OF PRUDENCE, SOON GREW
INTO A MATTER OF CHOICE, AS AN OBJECT OF THAT NEEDFUL SOLICITUDE WHICH
THERE WERE NO CHILDREN TO SUPPLY. HAD THERE BEEN A FAMILY TO PROVIDE
FOR, MRS. NORRIS MIGHT NEVER HAVE SAVED HER MONEY; BUT HAVING NO CARE
OF THAT KIND, THERE WAS NOTHING TO IMPEDE HER FRUGALITY, OR LESSEN THE
COMFORT OF MAKING A YEARLY ADDITION TO AN INCOME WHICH THEY HAD NEVER
LIVED UP TO. UNDER THIS INFATUATING PRINCIPLE, COUNTERACTED BY NO REAL
AFFECTION FOR HER SISTER, IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HER TO AIM AT MORE THAN
THE CREDIT OF PROJECTING AND ARRANGING SO EXPENSIVE A CHARITY; THOUGH
PERHAPS SHE MIGHT SO LITTLE KNOW HERSELF AS TO WALK HOME TO THE
PARSONAGE, AFTER THIS CONVERSATION, IN THE HAPPY BELIEF OF BEING THE
MOST LIBERAL-MINDED SISTER AND AUNT IN THE WORLD.

WHEN THE SUBJECT WAS BROUGHT FORWARD AGAIN, HER VIEWS WERE MORE FULLY
EXPLAINED; AND, IN REPLY TO LADY BERTRAM'S CALM INQUIRY OF "WHERE SHALL
THE CHILD COME TO FIRST, SISTER, TO YOU OR TO US?" SIR THOMAS HEARD WITH
SOME SURPRISE THAT IT WOULD BE TOTALLY OUT OF MRS. NORRIS'S POWER TO
TAKE ANY SHARE IN THE PERSONAL CHARGE OF HER. HE HAD BEEN CONSIDERING
HER AS A PARTICULARLY WELCOME ADDITION AT THE PARSONAGE, AS A DESIRABLE
COMPANION TO AN AUNT WHO HAD NO CHILDREN OF HER OWN; BUT HE FOUND
HIMSELF WHOLLY MISTAKEN. MRS. NORRIS WAS SORRY TO SAY THAT THE LITTLE
GIRL'S STAYING WITH THEM, AT LEAST AS THINGS THEN WERE, WAS QUITE OUT OF
THE QUESTION. POOR MR. NORRIS'S INDIFFERENT STATE OF HEALTH MADE IT AN
IMPOSSIBILITY: HE COULD NO MORE BEAR THE NOISE OF A CHILD THAN HE COULD
FLY; IF, INDEED, HE SHOULD EVER GET WELL OF HIS GOUTY COMPLAINTS, IT
WOULD BE A DIFFERENT MATTER: SHE SHOULD THEN BE GLAD TO TAKE HER TURN,
AND THINK NOTHING OF THE INCONVENIENCE; BUT JUST NOW, POOR MR. NORRIS
TOOK UP EVERY MOMENT OF HER TIME, AND THE VERY MENTION OF SUCH A THING
SHE WAS SURE WOULD DISTRACT HIM.

"THEN SHE HAD BETTER COME TO US," SAID LADY BERTRAM, WITH THE UTMOST
COMPOSURE. AFTER A SHORT PAUSE SIR THOMAS ADDED WITH DIGNITY, "YES, LET
HER HOME BE IN THIS HOUSE. WE WILL ENDEAVOUR TO DO OUR DUTY BY HER, AND
SHE WILL, AT LEAST, HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF COMPANIONS OF HER OWN AGE, AND
OF A REGULAR INSTRUCTRESS."

"VERY TRUE," CRIED MRS. NORRIS, "WHICH ARE BOTH VERY IMPORTANT
CONSIDERATIONS; AND IT WILL BE JUST THE SAME TO MISS LEE WHETHER SHE HAS
THREE GIRLS TO TEACH, OR ONLY TWO--THERE CAN BE NO DIFFERENCE. I ONLY
WISH I COULD BE MORE USEFUL; BUT YOU SEE I DO ALL IN MY POWER. I AM NOT
ONE OF THOSE THAT SPARE THEIR OWN TROUBLE; AND NANNY SHALL FETCH HER,
HOWEVER IT MAY PUT ME TO INCONVENIENCE TO HAVE MY CHIEF COUNSELLOR AWAY
FOR THREE DAYS. I SUPPOSE, SISTER, YOU WILL PUT THE CHILD IN THE LITTLE
WHITE ATTIC, NEAR THE OLD NURSERIES. IT WILL BE MUCH THE BEST PLACE
FOR HER, SO NEAR MISS LEE, AND NOT FAR FROM THE GIRLS, AND CLOSE BY THE
HOUSEMAIDS, WHO COULD EITHER OF THEM HELP TO DRESS HER, YOU KNOW, AND
TAKE CARE OF HER CLOTHES, FOR I SUPPOSE YOU WOULD NOT THINK IT FAIR TO
EXPECT ELLIS TO WAIT ON HER AS WELL AS THE OTHERS. INDEED, I DO NOT SEE
THAT YOU COULD POSSIBLY PLACE HER ANYWHERE ELSE."

LADY BERTRAM MADE NO OPPOSITION.

"I HOPE SHE WILL PROVE A WELL-DISPOSED GIRL," CONTINUED MRS. NORRIS,
"AND BE SENSIBLE OF HER UNCOMMON GOOD FORTUNE IN HAVING SUCH FRIENDS."

"SHOULD HER DISPOSITION BE REALLY BAD," SAID SIR THOMAS, "WE MUST NOT,
FOR OUR OWN CHILDREN'S SAKE, CONTINUE HER IN THE FAMILY; BUT THERE IS
NO REASON TO EXPECT SO GREAT AN EVIL. WE SHALL PROBABLY SEE MUCH TO WISH
ALTERED IN HER, AND MUST PREPARE OURSELVES FOR GROSS IGNORANCE, SOME
MEANNESS OF OPINIONS, AND VERY DISTRESSING VULGARITY OF MANNER; BUT
THESE ARE NOT INCURABLE FAULTS; NOR, I TRUST, CAN THEY BE DANGEROUS FOR
HER ASSOCIATES. HAD MY DAUGHTERS BEEN YOUNGER THAN HERSELF, I SHOULD
HAVE CONSIDERED THE INTRODUCTION OF SUCH A COMPANION AS A MATTER OF VERY
SERIOUS MOMENT; BUT, AS IT IS, I HOPE THERE CAN BE NOTHING TO FEAR FOR
THEM, AND EVERYTHING TO HOPE FOR HER, FROM THE ASSOCIATION."

"THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT I THINK," CRIED MRS. NORRIS, "AND WHAT I WAS
SAYING TO MY HUSBAND THIS MORNING. IT WILL BE AN EDUCATION FOR THE
CHILD, SAID I, ONLY BEING WITH HER COUSINS; IF MISS LEE TAUGHT HER
NOTHING, SHE WOULD LEARN TO BE GOOD AND CLEVER FROM THEM."

"I HOPE SHE WILL NOT TEASE MY POOR PUG," SAID LADY BERTRAM; "I HAVE BUT
JUST GOT JULIA TO LEAVE IT ALONE."

"THERE WILL BE SOME DIFFICULTY IN OUR WAY, MRS. NORRIS," OBSERVED SIR
THOMAS, "AS TO THE DISTINCTION PROPER TO BE MADE BETWEEN THE GIRLS
AS THEY GROW UP: HOW TO PRESERVE IN THE MINDS OF MY DAUGHTERS THE
CONSCIOUSNESS OF WHAT THEY ARE, WITHOUT MAKING THEM THINK TOO LOWLY OF
THEIR COUSIN; AND HOW, WITHOUT DEPRESSING HER SPIRITS TOO FAR, TO MAKE
HER REMEMBER THAT SHE IS NOT A MISS BERTRAM. I SHOULD WISH TO SEE THEM
VERY GOOD FRIENDS, AND WOULD, ON NO ACCOUNT, AUTHORISE IN MY GIRLS THE
SMALLEST DEGREE OF ARROGANCE TOWARDS THEIR RELATION; BUT STILL THEY
CANNOT BE EQUALS. THEIR RANK, FORTUNE, RIGHTS, AND EXPECTATIONS WILL
ALWAYS BE DIFFERENT. IT IS A POINT OF GREAT DELICACY, AND YOU MUST
ASSIST US IN OUR ENDEAVOURS TO CHOOSE EXACTLY THE RIGHT LINE OF
CONDUCT."

MRS. NORRIS WAS QUITE AT HIS SERVICE; AND THOUGH SHE PERFECTLY AGREED
WITH HIM AS TO ITS BEING A MOST DIFFICULT THING, ENCOURAGED HIM TO HOPE
THAT BETWEEN THEM IT WOULD BE EASILY MANAGED.

IT WILL BE READILY BELIEVED THAT MRS. NORRIS DID NOT WRITE TO HER SISTER
IN VAIN. MRS. PRICE SEEMED RATHER SURPRISED THAT A GIRL SHOULD BE
FIXED ON, WHEN SHE HAD SO MANY FINE BOYS, BUT ACCEPTED THE OFFER MOST
THANKFULLY, ASSURING THEM OF HER DAUGHTER'S BEING A VERY WELL-DISPOSED,
GOOD-HUMOURED GIRL, AND TRUSTING THEY WOULD NEVER HAVE CAUSE TO THROW
HER OFF. SHE SPOKE OF HER FARTHER AS SOMEWHAT DELICATE AND PUNY, BUT WAS
SANGUINE IN THE HOPE OF HER BEING MATERIALLY BETTER FOR CHANGE OF AIR.
POOR WOMAN! SHE PROBABLY THOUGHT CHANGE OF AIR MIGHT AGREE WITH MANY OF
HER CHILDREN.



CHAPTER II

THE LITTLE GIRL PERFORMED HER LONG JOURNEY IN SAFETY; AND AT NORTHAMPTON
WAS MET BY MRS. NORRIS, WHO THUS REGALED IN THE CREDIT OF BEING FOREMOST
TO WELCOME HER, AND IN THE IMPORTANCE OF LEADING HER IN TO THE OTHERS,
AND RECOMMENDING HER TO THEIR KINDNESS.

FANNY PRICE WAS AT THIS TIME JUST TEN YEARS OLD, AND THOUGH THERE MIGHT
NOT BE MUCH IN HER FIRST APPEARANCE TO CAPTIVATE, THERE WAS, AT LEAST,
NOTHING TO DISGUST HER RELATIONS. SHE WAS SMALL OF HER AGE, WITH NO GLOW
OF COMPLEXION, NOR ANY OTHER STRIKING BEAUTY; EXCEEDINGLY TIMID AND SHY,
AND SHRINKING FROM NOTICE; BUT HER AIR, THOUGH AWKWARD, WAS NOT VULGAR,
HER VOICE WAS SWEET, AND WHEN SHE SPOKE HER COUNTENANCE WAS PRETTY. SIR
THOMAS AND LADY BERTRAM RECEIVED HER VERY KINDLY; AND SIR THOMAS,
SEEING HOW MUCH SHE NEEDED ENCOURAGEMENT, TRIED TO BE ALL THAT WAS
CONCILIATING: BUT HE HAD TO WORK AGAINST A MOST UNTOWARD GRAVITY OF
DEPORTMENT; AND LADY BERTRAM, WITHOUT TAKING HALF SO MUCH TROUBLE, OR
SPEAKING ONE WORD WHERE HE SPOKE TEN, BY THE MERE AID OF A GOOD-HUMOURED
SMILE, BECAME IMMEDIATELY THE LESS AWFUL CHARACTER OF THE TWO.

THE YOUNG PEOPLE WERE ALL AT HOME, AND SUSTAINED THEIR SHARE IN THE
INTRODUCTION VERY WELL, WITH MUCH GOOD HUMOUR, AND NO EMBARRASSMENT, AT
LEAST ON THE PART OF THE SONS, WHO, AT SEVENTEEN AND SIXTEEN, AND TALL
OF THEIR AGE, HAD ALL THE GRANDEUR OF MEN IN THE EYES OF THEIR LITTLE
COUSIN. THE TWO GIRLS WERE MORE AT A LOSS FROM BEING YOUNGER AND IN
GREATER AWE OF THEIR FATHER, WHO ADDRESSED THEM ON THE OCCASION WITH
RATHER AN INJUDICIOUS PARTICULARITY. BUT THEY WERE TOO MUCH USED TO
COMPANY AND PRAISE TO HAVE ANYTHING LIKE NATURAL SHYNESS; AND THEIR
CONFIDENCE INCREASING FROM THEIR COUSIN'S TOTAL WANT OF IT, THEY WERE
SOON ABLE TO TAKE A FULL SURVEY OF HER FACE AND HER FROCK IN EASY
INDIFFERENCE.

THEY WERE A REMARKABLY FINE FAMILY, THE SONS VERY WELL-LOOKING, THE
DAUGHTERS DECIDEDLY HANDSOME, AND ALL OF THEM WELL-GROWN AND FORWARD OF
THEIR AGE, WHICH PRODUCED AS STRIKING A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE COUSINS
IN PERSON, AS EDUCATION HAD GIVEN TO THEIR ADDRESS; AND NO ONE WOULD
HAVE SUPPOSED THE GIRLS SO NEARLY OF AN AGE AS THEY REALLY WERE. THERE
WERE IN FACT BUT TWO YEARS BETWEEN THE YOUNGEST AND FANNY. JULIA
BERTRAM WAS ONLY TWELVE, AND MARIA BUT A YEAR OLDER. THE LITTLE VISITOR
MEANWHILE WAS AS UNHAPPY AS POSSIBLE. AFRAID OF EVERYBODY, ASHAMED OF
HERSELF, AND LONGING FOR THE HOME SHE HAD LEFT, SHE KNEW NOT HOW TO LOOK
UP, AND COULD SCARCELY SPEAK TO BE HEARD, OR WITHOUT CRYING. MRS. NORRIS
HAD BEEN TALKING TO HER THE WHOLE WAY FROM NORTHAMPTON OF HER WONDERFUL
GOOD FORTUNE, AND THE EXTRAORDINARY DEGREE OF GRATITUDE AND GOOD
BEHAVIOUR WHICH IT OUGHT TO PRODUCE, AND HER CONSCIOUSNESS OF MISERY WAS
THEREFORE INCREASED BY THE IDEA OF ITS BEING A WICKED THING FOR HER
NOT TO BE HAPPY. THE FATIGUE, TOO, OF SO LONG A JOURNEY, BECAME SOON NO
TRIFLING EVIL. IN VAIN WERE THE WELL-MEANT CONDESCENSIONS OF SIR THOMAS,
AND ALL THE OFFICIOUS PROGNOSTICATIONS OF MRS. NORRIS THAT SHE WOULD BE
A GOOD GIRL; IN VAIN DID LADY BERTRAM SMILE AND MAKE HER SIT ON THE SOFA
WITH HERSELF AND PUG, AND VAIN WAS EVEN THE SIGHT OF A GOOSEBERRY TART
TOWARDS GIVING HER COMFORT; SHE COULD SCARCELY SWALLOW TWO MOUTHFULS
BEFORE TEARS INTERRUPTED HER, AND SLEEP SEEMING TO BE HER LIKELIEST
FRIEND, SHE WAS TAKEN TO FINISH HER SORROWS IN BED.

"THIS IS NOT A VERY PROMISING BEGINNING," SAID MRS. NORRIS, WHEN FANNY
HAD LEFT THE ROOM. "AFTER ALL THAT I SAID TO HER AS WE CAME ALONG, I
THOUGHT SHE WOULD HAVE BEHAVED BETTER; I TOLD HER HOW MUCH MIGHT DEPEND
UPON HER ACQUITTING HERSELF WELL AT FIRST. I WISH THERE MAY NOT BE A
LITTLE SULKINESS OF TEMPER--HER POOR MOTHER HAD A GOOD DEAL; BUT WE MUST
MAKE ALLOWANCES FOR SUCH A CHILD--AND I DO NOT KNOW THAT HER BEING SORRY
TO LEAVE HER HOME IS REALLY AGAINST HER, FOR, WITH ALL ITS FAULTS,
IT WAS HER HOME, AND SHE CANNOT AS YET UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH SHE HAS
CHANGED FOR THE BETTER; BUT THEN THERE IS MODERATION IN ALL THINGS."

IT REQUIRED A LONGER TIME, HOWEVER, THAN MRS. NORRIS WAS INCLINED TO
ALLOW, TO RECONCILE FANNY TO THE NOVELTY OF MANSFIELD PARK, AND THE
SEPARATION FROM EVERYBODY SHE HAD BEEN USED TO. HER FEELINGS WERE VERY
ACUTE, AND TOO LITTLE UNDERSTOOD TO BE PROPERLY ATTENDED TO. NOBODY
MEANT TO BE UNKIND, BUT NOBODY PUT THEMSELVES OUT OF THEIR WAY TO SECURE
HER COMFORT.

THE HOLIDAY ALLOWED TO THE MISS BERTRAMS THE NEXT DAY, ON PURPOSE TO
AFFORD LEISURE FOR GETTING ACQUAINTED WITH, AND ENTERTAINING THEIR YOUNG
COUSIN, PRODUCED LITTLE UNION. THEY COULD NOT BUT HOLD HER CHEAP ON
FINDING THAT SHE HAD BUT TWO SASHES, AND HAD NEVER LEARNED FRENCH; AND
WHEN THEY PERCEIVED HER TO BE LITTLE STRUCK WITH THE DUET THEY WERE SO
GOOD AS TO PLAY, THEY COULD DO NO MORE THAN MAKE HER A GENEROUS PRESENT
OF SOME OF THEIR LEAST VALUED TOYS, AND LEAVE HER TO HERSELF, WHILE
THEY ADJOURNED TO WHATEVER MIGHT BE THE FAVOURITE HOLIDAY SPORT OF THE
MOMENT, MAKING ARTIFICIAL FLOWERS OR WASTING GOLD PAPER.

FANNY, WHETHER NEAR OR FROM HER COUSINS, WHETHER IN THE SCHOOLROOM, THE
DRAWING-ROOM, OR THE SHRUBBERY, WAS EQUALLY FORLORN, FINDING SOMETHING
TO FEAR IN EVERY PERSON AND PLACE. SHE WAS DISHEARTENED BY LADY
BERTRAM'S SILENCE, AWED BY SIR THOMAS'S GRAVE LOOKS, AND QUITE OVERCOME
BY MRS. NORRIS'S ADMONITIONS. HER ELDER COUSINS MORTIFIED HER BY
REFLECTIONS ON HER SIZE, AND ABASHED HER BY NOTICING HER SHYNESS: MISS
LEE WONDERED AT HER IGNORANCE, AND THE MAID-SERVANTS SNEERED AT HER
CLOTHES; AND WHEN TO THESE SORROWS WAS ADDED THE IDEA OF THE BROTHERS
AND SISTERS AMONG WHOM SHE HAD ALWAYS BEEN IMPORTANT AS PLAYFELLOW,
INSTRUCTRESS, AND NURSE, THE DESPONDENCE THAT SUNK HER LITTLE HEART WAS
SEVERE.

THE GRANDEUR OF THE HOUSE ASTONISHED, BUT COULD NOT CONSOLE HER. THE
ROOMS WERE TOO LARGE FOR HER TO MOVE IN WITH EASE: WHATEVER SHE TOUCHED
SHE EXPECTED TO INJURE, AND SHE CREPT ABOUT IN CONSTANT TERROR OF
SOMETHING OR OTHER; OFTEN RETREATING TOWARDS HER OWN CHAMBER TO CRY; AND
THE LITTLE GIRL WHO WAS SPOKEN OF IN THE DRAWING-ROOM WHEN SHE LEFT IT
AT NIGHT AS SEEMING SO DESIRABLY SENSIBLE OF HER PECULIAR GOOD FORTUNE,
ENDED EVERY DAY'S SORROWS BY SOBBING HERSELF TO SLEEP. A WEEK HAD
PASSED IN THIS WAY, AND NO SUSPICION OF IT CONVEYED BY HER QUIET
PASSIVE MANNER, WHEN SHE WAS FOUND ONE MORNING BY HER COUSIN EDMUND, THE
YOUNGEST OF THE SONS, SITTING CRYING ON THE ATTIC STAIRS.

"MY DEAR LITTLE COUSIN," SAID HE, WITH ALL THE GENTLENESS OF AN
EXCELLENT NATURE, "WHAT CAN BE THE MATTER?" AND SITTING DOWN BY HER,
HE WAS AT GREAT PAINS TO OVERCOME HER SHAME IN BEING SO SURPRISED, AND
PERSUADE HER TO SPEAK OPENLY. WAS SHE ILL? OR WAS ANYBODY ANGRY WITH
HER? OR HAD SHE QUARRELLED WITH MARIA AND JULIA? OR WAS SHE PUZZLED
ABOUT ANYTHING IN HER LESSON THAT HE COULD EXPLAIN? DID SHE, IN SHORT,
WANT ANYTHING HE COULD POSSIBLY GET HER, OR DO FOR HER? FOR A LONG WHILE
NO ANSWER COULD BE OBTAINED BEYOND A "NO, NO--NOT AT ALL--NO, THANK
YOU"; BUT HE STILL PERSEVERED; AND NO SOONER HAD HE BEGUN TO REVERT
TO HER OWN HOME, THAN HER INCREASED SOBS EXPLAINED TO HIM WHERE THE
GRIEVANCE LAY. HE TRIED TO CONSOLE HER.

"YOU ARE SORRY TO LEAVE MAMA, MY DEAR LITTLE FANNY," SAID HE, "WHICH
SHOWS YOU TO BE A VERY GOOD GIRL; BUT YOU MUST REMEMBER THAT YOU ARE
WITH RELATIONS AND FRIENDS, WHO ALL LOVE YOU, AND WISH TO MAKE YOU
HAPPY. LET US WALK OUT IN THE PARK, AND YOU SHALL TELL ME ALL ABOUT YOUR
BROTHERS AND SISTERS."

ON PURSUING THE SUBJECT, HE FOUND THAT, DEAR AS ALL THESE BROTHERS AND
SISTERS GENERALLY WERE, THERE WAS ONE AMONG THEM WHO RAN MORE IN HER
THOUGHTS THAN THE REST. IT WAS WILLIAM WHOM SHE TALKED OF MOST, AND
WANTED MOST TO SEE. WILLIAM, THE ELDEST, A YEAR OLDER THAN HERSELF, HER
CONSTANT COMPANION AND FRIEND; HER ADVOCATE WITH HER MOTHER (OF WHOM
HE WAS THE DARLING) IN EVERY DISTRESS. "WILLIAM DID NOT LIKE SHE SHOULD
COME AWAY; HE HAD TOLD HER HE SHOULD MISS HER VERY MUCH INDEED." "BUT
WILLIAM WILL WRITE TO YOU, I DARE SAY." "YES, HE HAD PROMISED HE WOULD,
BUT HE HAD TOLD HER TO WRITE FIRST." "AND WHEN SHALL YOU DO IT?" SHE
HUNG HER HEAD AND ANSWERED HESITATINGLY, "SHE DID NOT KNOW; SHE HAD NOT
ANY PAPER."

"IF THAT BE ALL YOUR DIFFICULTY, I WILL FURNISH YOU WITH PAPER AND EVERY
OTHER MATERIAL, AND YOU MAY WRITE YOUR LETTER WHENEVER YOU CHOOSE. WOULD
IT MAKE YOU HAPPY TO WRITE TO WILLIAM?"

"YES, VERY."

"THEN LET IT BE DONE NOW. COME WITH ME INTO THE BREAKFAST-ROOM, WE SHALL
FIND EVERYTHING THERE, AND BE SURE OF HAVING THE ROOM TO OURSELVES."

"BUT, COUSIN, WILL IT GO TO THE POST?"

"YES, DEPEND UPON ME IT SHALL: IT SHALL GO WITH THE OTHER LETTERS; AND,
AS YOUR UNCLE WILL FRANK IT, IT WILL COST WILLIAM NOTHING."

"MY UNCLE!" REPEATED FANNY, WITH A FRIGHTENED LOOK.

"YES, WHEN YOU HAVE WRITTEN THE LETTER, I WILL TAKE IT TO MY FATHER TO
FRANK."

FANNY THOUGHT IT A BOLD MEASURE, BUT OFFERED NO FURTHER RESISTANCE; AND
THEY WENT TOGETHER INTO THE BREAKFAST-ROOM, WHERE EDMUND PREPARED HER
PAPER, AND RULED HER LINES WITH ALL THE GOODWILL THAT HER BROTHER
COULD HIMSELF HAVE FELT, AND PROBABLY WITH SOMEWHAT MORE EXACTNESS. HE
CONTINUED WITH HER THE WHOLE TIME OF HER WRITING, TO ASSIST HER WITH HIS
PENKNIFE OR HIS ORTHOGRAPHY, AS EITHER WERE WANTED; AND ADDED TO THESE
ATTENTIONS, WHICH SHE FELT VERY MUCH, A KINDNESS TO HER BROTHER WHICH
DELIGHTED HER BEYOND ALL THE REST. HE WROTE WITH HIS OWN HAND HIS
LOVE TO HIS COUSIN WILLIAM, AND SENT HIM HALF A GUINEA UNDER THE SEAL.
FANNY'S FEELINGS ON THE OCCASION WERE SUCH AS SHE BELIEVED HERSELF
INCAPABLE OF EXPRESSING; BUT HER COUNTENANCE AND A FEW ARTLESS WORDS
FULLY CONVEYED ALL THEIR GRATITUDE AND DELIGHT, AND HER COUSIN BEGAN
TO FIND HER AN INTERESTING OBJECT. HE TALKED TO HER MORE, AND, FROM ALL
THAT SHE SAID, WAS CONVINCED OF HER HAVING AN AFFECTIONATE HEART, AND
A STRONG DESIRE OF DOING RIGHT; AND HE COULD PERCEIVE HER TO BE FARTHER
ENTITLED TO ATTENTION BY GREAT SENSIBILITY OF HER SITUATION, AND GREAT
TIMIDITY. HE HAD NEVER KNOWINGLY GIVEN HER PAIN, BUT HE NOW FELT THAT
SHE REQUIRED MORE POSITIVE KINDNESS; AND WITH THAT VIEW ENDEAVOURED,
IN THE FIRST PLACE, TO LESSEN HER FEARS OF THEM ALL, AND GAVE HER
ESPECIALLY A GREAT DEAL OF GOOD ADVICE AS TO PLAYING WITH MARIA AND
JULIA, AND BEING AS MERRY AS POSSIBLE.

FROM THIS DAY FANNY GREW MORE COMFORTABLE. SHE FELT THAT SHE HAD A
FRIEND, AND THE KINDNESS OF HER COUSIN EDMUND GAVE HER BETTER SPIRITS
WITH EVERYBODY ELSE. THE PLACE BECAME LESS STRANGE, AND THE PEOPLE LESS
FORMIDABLE; AND IF THERE WERE SOME AMONGST THEM WHOM SHE COULD NOT CEASE
TO FEAR, SHE BEGAN AT LEAST TO KNOW THEIR WAYS, AND TO CATCH THE BEST
MANNER OF CONFORMING TO THEM. THE LITTLE RUSTICITIES AND AWKWARDNESSES
WHICH HAD AT FIRST MADE GRIEVOUS INROADS ON THE TRANQUILLITY OF ALL,
AND NOT LEAST OF HERSELF, NECESSARILY WORE AWAY, AND SHE WAS NO LONGER
MATERIALLY AFRAID TO APPEAR BEFORE HER UNCLE, NOR DID HER AUNT NORRIS'S
VOICE MAKE HER START VERY MUCH. TO HER COUSINS SHE BECAME OCCASIONALLY
AN ACCEPTABLE COMPANION. THOUGH UNWORTHY, FROM INFERIORITY OF AGE AND
STRENGTH, TO BE THEIR CONSTANT ASSOCIATE, THEIR PLEASURES AND SCHEMES
WERE SOMETIMES OF A NATURE TO MAKE A THIRD VERY USEFUL, ESPECIALLY WHEN
THAT THIRD WAS OF AN OBLIGING, YIELDING TEMPER; AND THEY COULD NOT BUT
OWN, WHEN THEIR AUNT INQUIRED INTO HER FAULTS, OR THEIR BROTHER EDMUND
URGED HER CLAIMS TO THEIR KINDNESS, THAT "FANNY WAS GOOD-NATURED
ENOUGH."

EDMUND WAS UNIFORMLY KIND HIMSELF; AND SHE HAD NOTHING WORSE TO ENDURE
ON THE PART OF TOM THAN THAT SORT OF MERRIMENT WHICH A YOUNG MAN OF
SEVENTEEN WILL ALWAYS THINK FAIR WITH A CHILD OF TEN. HE WAS JUST
ENTERING INTO LIFE, FULL OF SPIRITS, AND WITH ALL THE LIBERAL
DISPOSITIONS OF AN ELDEST SON, WHO FEELS BORN ONLY FOR EXPENSE AND
ENJOYMENT. HIS KINDNESS TO HIS LITTLE COUSIN WAS CONSISTENT WITH HIS
SITUATION AND RIGHTS: HE MADE HER SOME VERY PRETTY PRESENTS, AND LAUGHED
AT HER.

AS HER APPEARANCE AND SPIRITS IMPROVED, SIR THOMAS AND MRS. NORRIS
THOUGHT WITH GREATER SATISFACTION OF THEIR BENEVOLENT PLAN; AND IT
WAS PRETTY SOON DECIDED BETWEEN THEM THAT, THOUGH FAR FROM CLEVER, SHE
SHOWED A TRACTABLE DISPOSITION, AND SEEMED LIKELY TO GIVE THEM LITTLE
TROUBLE. A MEAN OPINION OF HER ABILITIES WAS NOT CONFINED TO THEM.
FANNY COULD READ, WORK, AND WRITE, BUT SHE HAD BEEN TAUGHT NOTHING MORE;
AND AS HER COUSINS FOUND HER IGNORANT OF MANY THINGS WITH WHICH THEY HAD
BEEN LONG FAMILIAR, THEY THOUGHT HER PRODIGIOUSLY STUPID, AND FOR THE
FIRST TWO OR THREE WEEKS WERE CONTINUALLY BRINGING SOME FRESH REPORT OF
IT INTO THE DRAWING-ROOM. "DEAR MAMA, ONLY THINK, MY COUSIN CANNOT
PUT THE MAP OF EUROPE TOGETHER--OR MY COUSIN CANNOT TELL THE PRINCIPAL
RIVERS IN RUSSIA--OR, SHE NEVER HEARD OF ASIA MINOR--OR SHE DOES
NOT KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WATER-COLOURS AND CRAYONS!--HOW
STRANGE!--DID YOU EVER HEAR ANYTHING SO STUPID?"

"MY DEAR," THEIR CONSIDERATE AUNT WOULD REPLY, "IT IS VERY BAD, BUT
YOU MUST NOT EXPECT EVERYBODY TO BE AS FORWARD AND QUICK AT LEARNING AS
YOURSELF."

"BUT, AUNT, SHE IS REALLY SO VERY IGNORANT!--DO YOU KNOW, WE ASKED HER
LAST NIGHT WHICH WAY SHE WOULD GO TO GET TO IRELAND; AND SHE SAID, SHE
SHOULD CROSS TO THE ISLE OF WIGHT. SHE THINKS OF NOTHING BUT THE ISLE OF
WIGHT, AND SHE CALLS IT THE ISLAND, AS IF THERE WERE NO OTHER ISLAND
IN THE WORLD. I AM SURE I SHOULD HAVE BEEN ASHAMED OF MYSELF, IF I HAD
NOT KNOWN BETTER LONG BEFORE I WAS SO OLD AS SHE IS. I CANNOT REMEMBER
THE TIME WHEN I DID NOT KNOW A GREAT DEAL THAT SHE HAS NOT THE LEAST
NOTION OF YET. HOW LONG AGO IT IS, AUNT, SINCE WE USED TO REPEAT THE
CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER OF THE KINGS OF ENGLAND, WITH THE DATES OF THEIR
ACCESSION, AND MOST OF THE PRINCIPAL EVENTS OF THEIR REIGNS!"

"YES," ADDED THE OTHER; "AND OF THE ROMAN EMPERORS AS LOW AS SEVERUS;
BESIDES A GREAT DEAL OF THE HEATHEN MYTHOLOGY, AND ALL THE METALS,
SEMI-METALS, PLANETS, AND DISTINGUISHED PHILOSOPHERS."

"VERY TRUE INDEED, MY DEARS, BUT YOU ARE BLESSED WITH WONDERFUL
MEMORIES, AND YOUR POOR COUSIN HAS PROBABLY NONE AT ALL. THERE IS A
VAST DEAL OF DIFFERENCE IN MEMORIES, AS WELL AS IN EVERYTHING ELSE,
AND THEREFORE YOU MUST MAKE ALLOWANCE FOR YOUR COUSIN, AND PITY HER
DEFICIENCY. AND REMEMBER THAT, IF YOU ARE EVER SO FORWARD AND CLEVER
YOURSELVES, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS BE MODEST; FOR, MUCH AS YOU KNOW ALREADY,
THERE IS A GREAT DEAL MORE FOR YOU TO LEARN."

"YES, I KNOW THERE IS, TILL I AM SEVENTEEN. BUT I MUST TELL YOU ANOTHER
THING OF FANNY, SO ODD AND SO STUPID. DO YOU KNOW, SHE SAYS SHE DOES NOT
WANT TO LEARN EITHER MUSIC OR DRAWING."

"TO BE SURE, MY DEAR, THAT IS VERY STUPID INDEED, AND SHOWS A GREAT
WANT OF GENIUS AND EMULATION. BUT, ALL THINGS CONSIDERED, I DO NOT KNOW
WHETHER IT IS NOT AS WELL THAT IT SHOULD BE SO, FOR, THOUGH YOU KNOW
(OWING TO ME) YOUR PAPA AND MAMA ARE SO GOOD AS TO BRING HER UP WITH
YOU, IT IS NOT AT ALL NECESSARY THAT SHE SHOULD BE AS ACCOMPLISHED AS
YOU ARE;--ON THE CONTRARY, IT IS MUCH MORE DESIRABLE THAT THERE SHOULD
BE A DIFFERENCE."

SUCH WERE THE COUNSELS BY WHICH MRS. NORRIS ASSISTED TO FORM HER NIECES'
MINDS; AND IT IS NOT VERY WONDERFUL THAT, WITH ALL THEIR PROMISING
TALENTS AND EARLY INFORMATION, THEY SHOULD BE ENTIRELY DEFICIENT IN THE
LESS COMMON ACQUIREMENTS OF SELF-KNOWLEDGE, GENEROSITY AND HUMILITY. IN
EVERYTHING BUT DISPOSITION THEY WERE ADMIRABLY TAUGHT. SIR THOMAS DID
NOT KNOW WHAT WAS WANTING, BECAUSE, THOUGH A TRULY ANXIOUS FATHER, HE
WAS NOT OUTWARDLY AFFECTIONATE, AND THE RESERVE OF HIS MANNER REPRESSED
ALL THE FLOW OF THEIR SPIRITS BEFORE HIM.

TO THE EDUCATION OF HER DAUGHTERS LADY BERTRAM PAID NOT THE SMALLEST
ATTENTION. SHE HAD NOT TIME FOR SUCH CARES. SHE WAS A WOMAN WHO SPENT
HER DAYS IN SITTING, NICELY DRESSED, ON A SOFA, DOING SOME LONG PIECE OF
NEEDLEWORK, OF LITTLE USE AND NO BEAUTY, THINKING MORE OF HER PUG THAN
HER CHILDREN, BUT VERY INDULGENT TO THE LATTER WHEN IT DID NOT PUT
HERSELF TO INCONVENIENCE, GUIDED IN EVERYTHING IMPORTANT BY SIR THOMAS,
AND IN SMALLER CONCERNS BY HER SISTER. HAD SHE POSSESSED GREATER LEISURE
FOR THE SERVICE OF HER GIRLS, SHE WOULD PROBABLY HAVE SUPPOSED IT
UNNECESSARY, FOR THEY WERE UNDER THE CARE OF A GOVERNESS, WITH PROPER
MASTERS, AND COULD WANT NOTHING MORE. AS FOR FANNY'S BEING STUPID AT
LEARNING, "SHE COULD ONLY SAY IT WAS VERY UNLUCKY, BUT SOME PEOPLE
WERE STUPID, AND FANNY MUST TAKE MORE PAINS: SHE DID NOT KNOW WHAT
ELSE WAS TO BE DONE; AND, EXCEPT HER BEING SO DULL, SHE MUST ADD SHE SAW
NO HARM IN THE POOR LITTLE THING, AND ALWAYS FOUND HER VERY HANDY AND
QUICK IN CARRYING MESSAGES, AND FETCHING WHAT SHE WANTED."

FANNY, WITH ALL HER FAULTS OF IGNORANCE AND TIMIDITY, WAS FIXED AT
MANSFIELD PARK, AND LEARNING TO TRANSFER IN ITS FAVOUR MUCH OF HER
ATTACHMENT TO HER FORMER HOME, GREW UP THERE NOT UNHAPPILY AMONG HER
COUSINS. THERE WAS NO POSITIVE ILL-NATURE IN MARIA OR JULIA; AND THOUGH
FANNY WAS OFTEN MORTIFIED BY THEIR TREATMENT OF HER, SHE THOUGHT TOO
LOWLY OF HER OWN CLAIMS TO FEEL INJURED BY IT.

FROM ABOUT THE TIME OF HER ENTERING THE FAMILY, LADY BERTRAM, IN
CONSEQUENCE OF A LITTLE ILL-HEALTH, AND A GREAT DEAL OF INDOLENCE, GAVE
UP THE HOUSE IN TOWN, WHICH SHE HAD BEEN USED TO OCCUPY EVERY SPRING,
AND REMAINED WHOLLY IN THE COUNTRY, LEAVING SIR THOMAS TO ATTEND HIS
DUTY IN PARLIAMENT, WITH WHATEVER INCREASE OR DIMINUTION OF COMFORT
MIGHT ARISE FROM HER ABSENCE. IN THE COUNTRY, THEREFORE, THE MISS
BERTRAMS CONTINUED TO EXERCISE THEIR MEMORIES, PRACTISE THEIR DUETS,
AND GROW TALL AND WOMANLY: AND THEIR FATHER SAW THEM BECOMING IN PERSON,
MANNER, AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS, EVERYTHING THAT COULD SATISFY HIS ANXIETY.
HIS ELDEST SON WAS CARELESS AND EXTRAVAGANT, AND HAD ALREADY GIVEN HIM
MUCH UNEASINESS; BUT HIS OTHER CHILDREN PROMISED HIM NOTHING BUT GOOD.
HIS DAUGHTERS, HE FELT, WHILE THEY RETAINED THE NAME OF BERTRAM, MUST
BE GIVING IT NEW GRACE, AND IN QUITTING IT, HE TRUSTED, WOULD EXTEND
ITS RESPECTABLE ALLIANCES; AND THE CHARACTER OF EDMUND, HIS STRONG GOOD
SENSE AND UPRIGHTNESS OF MIND, BID MOST FAIRLY FOR UTILITY, HONOUR, AND
HAPPINESS TO HIMSELF AND ALL HIS CONNEXIONS. HE WAS TO BE A CLERGYMAN.

AMID THE CARES AND THE COMPLACENCY WHICH HIS OWN CHILDREN SUGGESTED,
SIR THOMAS DID NOT FORGET TO DO WHAT HE COULD FOR THE CHILDREN OF MRS.
PRICE: HE ASSISTED HER LIBERALLY IN THE EDUCATION AND DISPOSAL OF HER
SONS AS THEY BECAME OLD ENOUGH FOR A DETERMINATE PURSUIT; AND FANNY,
THOUGH ALMOST TOTALLY SEPARATED FROM HER FAMILY, WAS SENSIBLE OF THE
TRUEST SATISFACTION IN HEARING OF ANY KINDNESS TOWARDS THEM, OR OF
ANYTHING AT ALL PROMISING IN THEIR SITUATION OR CONDUCT. ONCE, AND ONCE
ONLY, IN THE COURSE OF MANY YEARS, HAD SHE THE HAPPINESS OF BEING WITH
WILLIAM. OF THE REST SHE SAW NOTHING: NOBODY SEEMED TO THINK OF HER EVER
GOING AMONGST THEM AGAIN, EVEN FOR A VISIT, NOBODY AT HOME SEEMED TO
WANT HER; BUT WILLIAM DETERMINING, SOON AFTER HER REMOVAL, TO BE A
SAILOR, WAS INVITED TO SPEND A WEEK WITH HIS SISTER IN NORTHAMPTONSHIRE
BEFORE HE WENT TO SEA. THEIR EAGER AFFECTION IN MEETING, THEIR EXQUISITE
DELIGHT IN BEING TOGETHER, THEIR HOURS OF HAPPY MIRTH, AND MOMENTS OF
SERIOUS CONFERENCE, MAY BE IMAGINED; AS WELL AS THE SANGUINE VIEWS AND
SPIRITS OF THE BOY EVEN TO THE LAST, AND THE MISERY OF THE GIRL WHEN HE
LEFT HER. LUCKILY THE VISIT HAPPENED IN THE CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS, WHEN SHE
COULD DIRECTLY LOOK FOR COMFORT TO HER COUSIN EDMUND; AND HE TOLD HER
SUCH CHARMING THINGS OF WHAT WILLIAM WAS TO DO, AND BE HEREAFTER, IN
CONSEQUENCE OF HIS PROFESSION, AS MADE HER GRADUALLY ADMIT THAT THE
SEPARATION MIGHT HAVE SOME USE. EDMUND'S FRIENDSHIP NEVER FAILED HER:
HIS LEAVING ETON FOR OXFORD MADE NO CHANGE IN HIS KIND DISPOSITIONS, AND
ONLY AFFORDED MORE FREQUENT OPPORTUNITIES OF PROVING THEM. WITHOUT ANY
DISPLAY OF DOING MORE THAN THE REST, OR ANY FEAR OF DOING TOO MUCH,
HE WAS ALWAYS TRUE TO HER INTERESTS, AND CONSIDERATE OF HER FEELINGS,
TRYING TO MAKE HER GOOD QUALITIES UNDERSTOOD, AND TO CONQUER THE
DIFFIDENCE WHICH PREVENTED THEIR BEING MORE APPARENT; GIVING HER ADVICE,
CONSOLATION, AND ENCOURAGEMENT.

KEPT BACK AS SHE WAS BY EVERYBODY ELSE, HIS SINGLE SUPPORT COULD NOT
BRING HER FORWARD; BUT HIS ATTENTIONS WERE OTHERWISE OF THE HIGHEST
IMPORTANCE IN ASSISTING THE IMPROVEMENT OF HER MIND, AND EXTENDING ITS
PLEASURES. HE KNEW HER TO BE CLEVER, TO HAVE A QUICK APPREHENSION
AS WELL AS GOOD SENSE, AND A FONDNESS FOR READING, WHICH, PROPERLY
DIRECTED, MUST BE AN EDUCATION IN ITSELF. MISS LEE TAUGHT HER FRENCH,
AND HEARD HER READ THE DAILY PORTION OF HISTORY; BUT HE RECOMMENDED
THE BOOKS WHICH CHARMED HER LEISURE HOURS, HE ENCOURAGED HER TASTE, AND
CORRECTED HER JUDGMENT: HE MADE READING USEFUL BY TALKING TO HER OF WHAT
SHE READ, AND HEIGHTENED ITS ATTRACTION BY JUDICIOUS PRAISE. IN RETURN
FOR SUCH SERVICES SHE LOVED HIM BETTER THAN ANYBODY IN THE WORLD EXCEPT
WILLIAM: HER HEART WAS DIVIDED BETWEEN THE TWO.



CHAPTER III

THE FIRST EVENT OF ANY IMPORTANCE IN THE FAMILY WAS THE DEATH OF MR.
NORRIS, WHICH HAPPENED WHEN FANNY WAS ABOUT FIFTEEN, AND NECESSARILY
INTRODUCED ALTERATIONS AND NOVELTIES. MRS. NORRIS, ON QUITTING THE
PARSONAGE, REMOVED FIRST TO THE PARK, AND AFTERWARDS TO A SMALL HOUSE
OF SIR THOMAS'S IN THE VILLAGE, AND CONSOLED HERSELF FOR THE LOSS OF HER
HUSBAND BY CONSIDERING THAT SHE COULD DO VERY WELL WITHOUT HIM; AND FOR
HER REDUCTION OF INCOME BY THE EVIDENT NECESSITY OF STRICTER ECONOMY.

THE LIVING WAS HEREAFTER FOR EDMUND; AND, HAD HIS UNCLE DIED A FEW YEARS
SOONER, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DULY GIVEN TO SOME FRIEND TO HOLD TILL HE
WERE OLD ENOUGH FOR ORDERS. BUT TOM'S EXTRAVAGANCE HAD, PREVIOUS TO
THAT EVENT, BEEN SO GREAT AS TO RENDER A DIFFERENT DISPOSAL OF THE NEXT
PRESENTATION NECESSARY, AND THE YOUNGER BROTHER MUST HELP TO PAY FOR THE
PLEASURES OF THE ELDER. THERE WAS ANOTHER FAMILY LIVING ACTUALLY HELD
FOR EDMUND; BUT THOUGH THIS CIRCUMSTANCE HAD MADE THE ARRANGEMENT
SOMEWHAT EASIER TO SIR THOMAS'S CONSCIENCE, HE COULD NOT BUT FEEL IT TO
BE AN ACT OF INJUSTICE, AND HE EARNESTLY TRIED TO IMPRESS HIS ELDEST SON
WITH THE SAME CONVICTION, IN THE HOPE OF ITS PRODUCING A BETTER EFFECT
THAN ANYTHING HE HAD YET BEEN ABLE TO SAY OR DO.

"I BLUSH FOR YOU, TOM," SAID HE, IN HIS MOST DIGNIFIED MANNER; "I BLUSH
FOR THE EXPEDIENT WHICH I AM DRIVEN ON, AND I TRUST I MAY PITY YOUR
FEELINGS AS A BROTHER ON THE OCCASION. YOU HAVE ROBBED EDMUND FOR TEN,
TWENTY, THIRTY YEARS, PERHAPS FOR LIFE, OF MORE THAN HALF THE INCOME
WHICH OUGHT TO BE HIS. IT MAY HEREAFTER BE IN MY POWER, OR IN YOURS
(I HOPE IT WILL), TO PROCURE HIM BETTER PREFERMENT; BUT IT MUST NOT
BE FORGOTTEN THAT NO BENEFIT OF THAT SORT WOULD HAVE BEEN BEYOND HIS
NATURAL CLAIMS ON US, AND THAT NOTHING CAN, IN FACT, BE AN EQUIVALENT
FOR THE CERTAIN ADVANTAGE WHICH HE IS NOW OBLIGED TO FOREGO THROUGH THE
URGENCY OF YOUR DEBTS."

TOM LISTENED WITH SOME SHAME AND SOME SORROW; BUT ESCAPING AS QUICKLY AS
POSSIBLE, COULD SOON WITH CHEERFUL SELFISHNESS REFLECT, FIRSTLY, THAT HE
HAD NOT BEEN HALF SO MUCH IN DEBT AS SOME OF HIS FRIENDS; SECONDLY, THAT
HIS FATHER HAD MADE A MOST TIRESOME PIECE OF WORK OF IT; AND,
THIRDLY, THAT THE FUTURE INCUMBENT, WHOEVER HE MIGHT BE, WOULD, IN ALL
PROBABILITY, DIE VERY SOON.

ON MR. NORRIS'S DEATH THE PRESENTATION BECAME THE RIGHT OF A DR. GRANT,
WHO CAME CONSEQUENTLY TO RESIDE AT MANSFIELD; AND ON PROVING TO BE A
HEARTY MAN OF FORTY-FIVE, SEEMED LIKELY TO DISAPPOINT MR. BERTRAM'S
CALCULATIONS. BUT "NO, HE WAS A SHORT-NECKED, APOPLECTIC SORT OF FELLOW,
AND, PLIED WELL WITH GOOD THINGS, WOULD SOON POP OFF."

HE HAD A WIFE ABOUT FIFTEEN YEARS HIS JUNIOR, BUT NO CHILDREN; AND
THEY ENTERED THE NEIGHBOURHOOD WITH THE USUAL FAIR REPORT OF BEING VERY
RESPECTABLE, AGREEABLE PEOPLE.

THE TIME WAS NOW COME WHEN SIR THOMAS EXPECTED HIS SISTER-IN-LAW TO
CLAIM HER SHARE IN THEIR NIECE, THE CHANGE IN MRS. NORRIS'S SITUATION,
AND THE IMPROVEMENT IN FANNY'S AGE, SEEMING NOT MERELY TO DO AWAY ANY
FORMER OBJECTION TO THEIR LIVING TOGETHER, BUT EVEN TO GIVE IT THE MOST
DECIDED ELIGIBILITY; AND AS HIS OWN CIRCUMSTANCES WERE RENDERED LESS
FAIR THAN HERETOFORE, BY SOME RECENT LOSSES ON HIS WEST INDIA ESTATE, IN
ADDITION TO HIS ELDEST SON'S EXTRAVAGANCE, IT BECAME NOT UNDESIRABLE
TO HIMSELF TO BE RELIEVED FROM THE EXPENSE OF HER SUPPORT, AND THE
OBLIGATION OF HER FUTURE PROVISION. IN THE FULLNESS OF HIS BELIEF THAT
SUCH A THING MUST BE, HE MENTIONED ITS PROBABILITY TO HIS WIFE; AND THE
FIRST TIME OF THE SUBJECT'S OCCURRING TO HER AGAIN HAPPENING TO BE WHEN
FANNY WAS PRESENT, SHE CALMLY OBSERVED TO HER, "SO, FANNY, YOU ARE GOING
TO LEAVE US, AND LIVE WITH MY SISTER. HOW SHALL YOU LIKE IT?"

FANNY WAS TOO MUCH SURPRISED TO DO MORE THAN REPEAT HER AUNT'S WORDS,
"GOING TO LEAVE YOU?"

"YES, MY DEAR; WHY SHOULD YOU BE ASTONISHED? YOU HAVE BEEN FIVE YEARS
WITH US, AND MY SISTER ALWAYS MEANT TO TAKE YOU WHEN MR. NORRIS DIED.
BUT YOU MUST COME UP AND TACK ON MY PATTERNS ALL THE SAME."

THE NEWS WAS AS DISAGREEABLE TO FANNY AS IT HAD BEEN UNEXPECTED. SHE HAD
NEVER RECEIVED KINDNESS FROM HER AUNT NORRIS, AND COULD NOT LOVE HER.

"I SHALL BE VERY SORRY TO GO AWAY," SAID SHE, WITH A FALTERING VOICE.

"YES, I DARE SAY YOU WILL; THAT'S NATURAL ENOUGH. I SUPPOSE YOU HAVE
HAD AS LITTLE TO VEX YOU SINCE YOU CAME INTO THIS HOUSE AS ANY CREATURE
IN THE WORLD."

"I HOPE I AM NOT UNGRATEFUL, AUNT," SAID FANNY MODESTLY.

"NO, MY DEAR; I HOPE NOT. I HAVE ALWAYS FOUND YOU A VERY GOOD GIRL."

"AND AM I NEVER TO LIVE HERE AGAIN?"

"NEVER, MY DEAR; BUT YOU ARE SURE OF A COMFORTABLE HOME. IT CAN MAKE
VERY LITTLE DIFFERENCE TO YOU, WHETHER YOU ARE IN ONE HOUSE OR THE
OTHER."

FANNY LEFT THE ROOM WITH A VERY SORROWFUL HEART; SHE COULD NOT FEEL THE
DIFFERENCE TO BE SO SMALL, SHE COULD NOT THINK OF LIVING WITH HER AUNT
WITH ANYTHING LIKE SATISFACTION. AS SOON AS SHE MET WITH EDMUND SHE TOLD
HIM HER DISTRESS.

"COUSIN," SAID SHE, "SOMETHING IS GOING TO HAPPEN WHICH I DO NOT LIKE
AT ALL; AND THOUGH YOU HAVE OFTEN PERSUADED ME INTO BEING RECONCILED TO
THINGS THAT I DISLIKED AT FIRST, YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO DO IT NOW. I AM
GOING TO LIVE ENTIRELY WITH MY AUNT NORRIS."

"INDEED!"

"YES; MY AUNT BERTRAM HAS JUST TOLD ME SO. IT IS QUITE SETTLED. I AM TO
LEAVE MANSFIELD PARK, AND GO TO THE WHITE HOUSE, I SUPPOSE, AS SOON AS
SHE IS REMOVED THERE."

"WELL, FANNY, AND IF THE PLAN WERE NOT UNPLEASANT TO YOU, I SHOULD CALL
IT AN EXCELLENT ONE."

"OH, COUSIN!"

"IT HAS EVERYTHING ELSE IN ITS FAVOUR. MY AUNT IS ACTING LIKE A SENSIBLE
WOMAN IN WISHING FOR YOU. SHE IS CHOOSING A FRIEND AND COMPANION EXACTLY
WHERE SHE OUGHT, AND I AM GLAD HER LOVE OF MONEY DOES NOT INTERFERE.
YOU WILL BE WHAT YOU OUGHT TO BE TO HER. I HOPE IT DOES NOT DISTRESS YOU
VERY MUCH, FANNY?"

"INDEED IT DOES: I CANNOT LIKE IT. I LOVE THIS HOUSE AND EVERYTHING IN
IT: I SHALL LOVE NOTHING THERE. YOU KNOW HOW UNCOMFORTABLE I FEEL WITH
HER."

"I CAN SAY NOTHING FOR HER MANNER TO YOU AS A CHILD; BUT IT WAS THE
SAME WITH US ALL, OR NEARLY SO. SHE NEVER KNEW HOW TO BE PLEASANT TO
CHILDREN. BUT YOU ARE NOW OF AN AGE TO BE TREATED BETTER; I THINK SHE IS
BEHAVING BETTER ALREADY; AND WHEN YOU ARE HER ONLY COMPANION, YOU MUST
BE IMPORTANT TO HER."

"I CAN NEVER BE IMPORTANT TO ANY ONE."

"WHAT IS TO PREVENT YOU?"

"EVERYTHING. MY SITUATION, MY FOOLISHNESS AND AWKWARDNESS."

"AS TO YOUR FOOLISHNESS AND AWKWARDNESS, MY DEAR FANNY, BELIEVE ME, YOU
NEVER HAVE A SHADOW OF EITHER, BUT IN USING THE WORDS SO IMPROPERLY.
THERE IS NO REASON IN THE WORLD WHY YOU SHOULD NOT BE IMPORTANT WHERE
YOU ARE KNOWN. YOU HAVE GOOD SENSE, AND A SWEET TEMPER, AND I AM SURE
YOU HAVE A GRATEFUL HEART, THAT COULD NEVER RECEIVE KINDNESS WITHOUT
WISHING TO RETURN IT. I DO NOT KNOW ANY BETTER QUALIFICATIONS FOR A
FRIEND AND COMPANION."

"YOU ARE TOO KIND," SAID FANNY, COLOURING AT SUCH PRAISE; "HOW SHALL I
EVER THANK YOU AS I OUGHT, FOR THINKING SO WELL OF ME. OH! COUSIN, IF I
AM TO GO AWAY, I SHALL REMEMBER YOUR GOODNESS TO THE LAST MOMENT OF MY
LIFE."

"WHY, INDEED, FANNY, I SHOULD HOPE TO BE REMEMBERED AT SUCH A DISTANCE
AS THE WHITE HOUSE. YOU SPEAK AS IF YOU WERE GOING TWO HUNDRED MILES
OFF INSTEAD OF ONLY ACROSS THE PARK; BUT YOU WILL BELONG TO US ALMOST
AS MUCH AS EVER. THE TWO FAMILIES WILL BE MEETING EVERY DAY IN THE
YEAR. THE ONLY DIFFERENCE WILL BE THAT, LIVING WITH YOUR AUNT, YOU WILL
NECESSARILY BE BROUGHT FORWARD AS YOU OUGHT TO BE. HERE THERE ARE
TOO MANY WHOM YOU CAN HIDE BEHIND; BUT WITH HER YOU WILL BE FORCED TO
SPEAK FOR YOURSELF."

"OH! I DO NOT SAY SO."

"I MUST SAY IT, AND SAY IT WITH PLEASURE. MRS. NORRIS IS MUCH BETTER
FITTED THAN MY MOTHER FOR HAVING THE CHARGE OF YOU NOW. SHE IS OF A
TEMPER TO DO A GREAT DEAL FOR ANYBODY SHE REALLY INTERESTS HERSELF
ABOUT, AND SHE WILL FORCE YOU TO DO JUSTICE TO YOUR NATURAL POWERS."

FANNY SIGHED, AND SAID, "I CANNOT SEE THINGS AS YOU DO; BUT I OUGHT TO
BELIEVE YOU TO BE RIGHT RATHER THAN MYSELF, AND I AM VERY MUCH OBLIGED
TO YOU FOR TRYING TO RECONCILE ME TO WHAT MUST BE. IF I COULD SUPPOSE
MY AUNT REALLY TO CARE FOR ME, IT WOULD BE DELIGHTFUL TO FEEL MYSELF OF
CONSEQUENCE TO ANYBODY. HERE, I KNOW, I AM OF NONE, AND YET I LOVE THE
PLACE SO WELL."

"THE PLACE, FANNY, IS WHAT YOU WILL NOT QUIT, THOUGH YOU QUIT THE HOUSE.
YOU WILL HAVE AS FREE A COMMAND OF THE PARK AND GARDENS AS EVER. EVEN
YOUR CONSTANT LITTLE HEART NEED NOT TAKE FRIGHT AT SUCH A NOMINAL
CHANGE. YOU WILL HAVE THE SAME WALKS TO FREQUENT, THE SAME LIBRARY TO
CHOOSE FROM, THE SAME PEOPLE TO LOOK AT, THE SAME HORSE TO RIDE."

"VERY TRUE. YES, DEAR OLD GREY PONY! AH! COUSIN, WHEN I REMEMBER HOW
MUCH I USED TO DREAD RIDING, WHAT TERRORS IT GAVE ME TO HEAR IT TALKED
OF AS LIKELY TO DO ME GOOD (OH! HOW I HAVE TREMBLED AT MY UNCLE'S
OPENING HIS LIPS IF HORSES WERE TALKED OF), AND THEN THINK OF THE KIND
PAINS YOU TOOK TO REASON AND PERSUADE ME OUT OF MY FEARS, AND CONVINCE
ME THAT I SHOULD LIKE IT AFTER A LITTLE WHILE, AND FEEL HOW RIGHT YOU
PROVED TO BE, I AM INCLINED TO HOPE YOU MAY ALWAYS PROPHESY AS WELL."

"AND I AM QUITE CONVINCED THAT YOUR BEING WITH MRS. NORRIS WILL BE AS
GOOD FOR YOUR MIND AS RIDING HAS BEEN FOR YOUR HEALTH, AND AS MUCH FOR
YOUR ULTIMATE HAPPINESS TOO."

SO ENDED THEIR DISCOURSE, WHICH, FOR ANY VERY APPROPRIATE SERVICE IT
COULD RENDER FANNY, MIGHT AS WELL HAVE BEEN SPARED, FOR MRS. NORRIS HAD
NOT THE SMALLEST INTENTION OF TAKING HER. IT HAD NEVER OCCURRED TO HER,
ON THE PRESENT OCCASION, BUT AS A THING TO BE CAREFULLY AVOIDED. TO
PREVENT ITS BEING EXPECTED, SHE HAD FIXED ON THE SMALLEST HABITATION
WHICH COULD RANK AS GENTEEL AMONG THE BUILDINGS OF MANSFIELD PARISH,
THE WHITE HOUSE BEING ONLY JUST LARGE ENOUGH TO RECEIVE HERSELF AND HER
SERVANTS, AND ALLOW A SPARE ROOM FOR A FRIEND, OF WHICH SHE MADE A
VERY PARTICULAR POINT. THE SPARE ROOMS AT THE PARSONAGE HAD NEVER BEEN
WANTED, BUT THE ABSOLUTE NECESSITY OF A SPARE ROOM FOR A FRIEND WAS NOW
NEVER FORGOTTEN. NOT ALL HER PRECAUTIONS, HOWEVER, COULD SAVE HER FROM
BEING SUSPECTED OF SOMETHING BETTER; OR, PERHAPS, HER VERY DISPLAY OF
THE IMPORTANCE OF A SPARE ROOM MIGHT HAVE MISLED SIR THOMAS TO SUPPOSE
IT REALLY INTENDED FOR FANNY. LADY BERTRAM SOON BROUGHT THE MATTER TO A
CERTAINTY BY CARELESSLY OBSERVING TO MRS. NORRIS--

"I THINK, SISTER, WE NEED NOT KEEP MISS LEE ANY LONGER, WHEN FANNY GOES
TO LIVE WITH YOU."

MRS. NORRIS ALMOST STARTED. "LIVE WITH ME, DEAR LADY BERTRAM! WHAT DO
YOU MEAN?"

"IS SHE NOT TO LIVE WITH YOU? I THOUGHT YOU HAD SETTLED IT WITH SIR
THOMAS."

"ME! NEVER. I NEVER SPOKE A SYLLABLE ABOUT IT TO SIR THOMAS, NOR HE TO
ME. FANNY LIVE WITH ME! THE LAST THING IN THE WORLD FOR ME TO THINK
OF, OR FOR ANYBODY TO WISH THAT REALLY KNOWS US BOTH. GOOD HEAVEN! WHAT
COULD I DO WITH FANNY? ME! A POOR, HELPLESS, FORLORN WIDOW, UNFIT FOR
ANYTHING, MY SPIRITS QUITE BROKE DOWN; WHAT COULD I DO WITH A GIRL AT
HER TIME OF LIFE? A GIRL OF FIFTEEN! THE VERY AGE OF ALL OTHERS TO NEED
MOST ATTENTION AND CARE, AND PUT THE CHEERFULLEST SPIRITS TO THE TEST!
SURE SIR THOMAS COULD NOT SERIOUSLY EXPECT SUCH A THING! SIR THOMAS IS
TOO MUCH MY FRIEND. NOBODY THAT WISHES ME WELL, I AM SURE, WOULD PROPOSE
IT. HOW CAME SIR THOMAS TO SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT IT?"

"INDEED, I DO NOT KNOW. I SUPPOSE HE THOUGHT IT BEST."

"BUT WHAT DID HE SAY? HE COULD NOT SAY HE WISHED ME TO TAKE FANNY. I
AM SURE IN HIS HEART HE COULD NOT WISH ME TO DO IT."

"NO; HE ONLY SAID HE THOUGHT IT VERY LIKELY; AND I THOUGHT SO TOO. WE
BOTH THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A COMFORT TO YOU. BUT IF YOU DO NOT LIKE IT,
THERE IS NO MORE TO BE SAID. SHE IS NO ENCUMBRANCE HERE."

"DEAR SISTER, IF YOU CONSIDER MY UNHAPPY STATE, HOW CAN SHE BE ANY
COMFORT TO ME? HERE AM I, A POOR DESOLATE WIDOW, DEPRIVED OF THE BEST OF
HUSBANDS, MY HEALTH GONE IN ATTENDING AND NURSING HIM, MY SPIRITS STILL
WORSE, ALL MY PEACE IN THIS WORLD DESTROYED, WITH HARDLY ENOUGH TO
SUPPORT ME IN THE RANK OF A GENTLEWOMAN, AND ENABLE ME TO LIVE SO AS NOT
TO DISGRACE THE MEMORY OF THE DEAR DEPARTED--WHAT POSSIBLE COMFORT COULD
I HAVE IN TAKING SUCH A CHARGE UPON ME AS FANNY? IF I COULD WISH IT FOR
MY OWN SAKE, I WOULD NOT DO SO UNJUST A THING BY THE POOR GIRL. SHE
IS IN GOOD HANDS, AND SURE OF DOING WELL. I MUST STRUGGLE THROUGH MY
SORROWS AND DIFFICULTIES AS I CAN."

"THEN YOU WILL NOT MIND LIVING BY YOURSELF QUITE ALONE?"

"LADY BERTRAM, I DO NOT COMPLAIN. I KNOW I CANNOT LIVE AS I HAVE DONE,
BUT I MUST RETRENCH WHERE I CAN, AND LEARN TO BE A BETTER MANAGER. I
HAVE BEEN A LIBERAL HOUSEKEEPER ENOUGH, BUT I SHALL NOT BE ASHAMED
TO PRACTISE ECONOMY NOW. MY SITUATION IS AS MUCH ALTERED AS MY INCOME.
A GREAT MANY THINGS WERE DUE FROM POOR MR. NORRIS, AS CLERGYMAN OF THE
PARISH, THAT CANNOT BE EXPECTED FROM ME. IT IS UNKNOWN HOW MUCH WAS
CONSUMED IN OUR KITCHEN BY ODD COMERS AND GOERS. AT THE WHITE HOUSE,
MATTERS MUST BE BETTER LOOKED AFTER. I MUST LIVE WITHIN MY INCOME, OR
I SHALL BE MISERABLE; AND I OWN IT WOULD GIVE ME GREAT SATISFACTION TO
BE ABLE TO DO RATHER MORE, TO LAY BY A LITTLE AT THE END OF THE YEAR."

"I DARE SAY YOU WILL. YOU ALWAYS DO, DON'T YOU?"

"MY OBJECT, LADY BERTRAM, IS TO BE OF USE TO THOSE THAT COME AFTER ME.
IT IS FOR YOUR CHILDREN'S GOOD THAT I WISH TO BE RICHER. I HAVE NOBODY
ELSE TO CARE FOR, BUT I SHOULD BE VERY GLAD TO THINK I COULD LEAVE A
LITTLE TRIFLE AMONG THEM WORTH THEIR HAVING."

"YOU ARE VERY GOOD, BUT DO NOT TROUBLE YOURSELF ABOUT THEM. THEY ARE
SURE OF BEING WELL PROVIDED FOR. SIR THOMAS WILL TAKE CARE OF THAT."

"WHY, YOU KNOW, SIR THOMAS'S MEANS WILL BE RATHER STRAITENED IF THE
ANTIGUA ESTATE IS TO MAKE SUCH POOR RETURNS."

"OH! THAT WILL SOON BE SETTLED. SIR THOMAS HAS BEEN WRITING ABOUT IT,
I KNOW."

"WELL, LADY BERTRAM," SAID MRS. NORRIS, MOVING TO GO, "I CAN ONLY SAY
THAT MY SOLE DESIRE IS TO BE OF USE TO YOUR FAMILY: AND SO, IF SIR
THOMAS SHOULD EVER SPEAK AGAIN ABOUT MY TAKING FANNY, YOU WILL BE ABLE
TO SAY THAT MY HEALTH AND SPIRITS PUT IT QUITE OUT OF THE QUESTION;
BESIDES THAT, I REALLY SHOULD NOT HAVE A BED TO GIVE HER, FOR I MUST
KEEP A SPARE ROOM FOR A FRIEND."

LADY BERTRAM REPEATED ENOUGH OF THIS CONVERSATION TO HER HUSBAND TO
CONVINCE HIM HOW MUCH HE HAD MISTAKEN HIS SISTER-IN-LAW'S VIEWS; AND
SHE WAS FROM THAT MOMENT PERFECTLY SAFE FROM ALL EXPECTATION, OR THE
SLIGHTEST ALLUSION TO IT FROM HIM. HE COULD NOT BUT WONDER AT HER
REFUSING TO DO ANYTHING FOR A NIECE WHOM SHE HAD BEEN SO FORWARD TO
ADOPT; BUT, AS SHE TOOK EARLY CARE TO MAKE HIM, AS WELL AS LADY BERTRAM,
UNDERSTAND THAT WHATEVER SHE POSSESSED WAS DESIGNED FOR THEIR FAMILY,
HE SOON GREW RECONCILED TO A DISTINCTION WHICH, AT THE SAME TIME THAT IT
WAS ADVANTAGEOUS AND COMPLIMENTARY TO THEM, WOULD ENABLE HIM BETTER TO
PROVIDE FOR FANNY HIMSELF.

FANNY SOON LEARNT HOW UNNECESSARY HAD BEEN HER FEARS OF A REMOVAL;
AND HER SPONTANEOUS, UNTAUGHT FELICITY ON THE DISCOVERY, CONVEYED SOME
CONSOLATION TO EDMUND FOR HIS DISAPPOINTMENT IN WHAT HE HAD EXPECTED TO
BE SO ESSENTIALLY SERVICEABLE TO HER. MRS. NORRIS TOOK POSSESSION OF THE
WHITE HOUSE, THE GRANTS ARRIVED AT THE PARSONAGE, AND THESE EVENTS OVER,
EVERYTHING AT MANSFIELD WENT ON FOR SOME TIME AS USUAL.

THE GRANTS SHOWING A DISPOSITION TO BE FRIENDLY AND SOCIABLE, GAVE GREAT
SATISFACTION IN THE MAIN AMONG THEIR NEW ACQUAINTANCE. THEY HAD THEIR
FAULTS, AND MRS. NORRIS SOON FOUND THEM OUT. THE DOCTOR WAS VERY FOND OF
EATING, AND WOULD HAVE A GOOD DINNER EVERY DAY; AND MRS. GRANT, INSTEAD
OF CONTRIVING TO GRATIFY HIM AT LITTLE EXPENSE, GAVE HER COOK AS HIGH
WAGES AS THEY DID AT MANSFIELD PARK, AND WAS SCARCELY EVER SEEN IN HER
OFFICES. MRS. NORRIS COULD NOT SPEAK WITH ANY TEMPER OF SUCH GRIEVANCES,
NOR OF THE QUANTITY OF BUTTER AND EGGS THAT WERE REGULARLY CONSUMED
IN THE HOUSE. "NOBODY LOVED PLENTY AND HOSPITALITY MORE THAN HERSELF;
NOBODY MORE HATED PITIFUL DOINGS; THE PARSONAGE, SHE BELIEVED, HAD NEVER
BEEN WANTING IN COMFORTS OF ANY SORT, HAD NEVER BORNE A BAD CHARACTER
IN HER TIME, BUT THIS WAS A WAY OF GOING ON THAT SHE COULD NOT
UNDERSTAND. A FINE LADY IN A COUNTRY PARSONAGE WAS QUITE OUT OF PLACE.
HER STORE-ROOM, SHE THOUGHT, MIGHT HAVE BEEN GOOD ENOUGH FOR MRS.
GRANT TO GO INTO. INQUIRE WHERE SHE WOULD, SHE COULD NOT FIND OUT THAT
MRS. GRANT HAD EVER HAD MORE THAN FIVE THOUSAND POUNDS."

LADY BERTRAM LISTENED WITHOUT MUCH INTEREST TO THIS SORT OF INVECTIVE.
SHE COULD NOT ENTER INTO THE WRONGS OF AN ECONOMIST, BUT SHE FELT ALL
THE INJURIES OF BEAUTY IN MRS. GRANT'S BEING SO WELL SETTLED IN LIFE
WITHOUT BEING HANDSOME, AND EXPRESSED HER ASTONISHMENT ON THAT POINT
ALMOST AS OFTEN, THOUGH NOT SO DIFFUSELY, AS MRS. NORRIS DISCUSSED THE
OTHER.

THESE OPINIONS HAD BEEN HARDLY CANVASSED A YEAR BEFORE ANOTHER EVENT
AROSE OF SUCH IMPORTANCE IN THE FAMILY, AS MIGHT FAIRLY CLAIM SOME PLACE
IN THE THOUGHTS AND CONVERSATION OF THE LADIES. SIR THOMAS FOUND IT
EXPEDIENT TO GO TO ANTIGUA HIMSELF, FOR THE BETTER ARRANGEMENT OF HIS
AFFAIRS, AND HE TOOK HIS ELDEST SON WITH HIM, IN THE HOPE OF DETACHING
HIM FROM SOME BAD CONNEXIONS AT HOME. THEY LEFT ENGLAND WITH THE
PROBABILITY OF BEING NEARLY A TWELVEMONTH ABSENT.

THE NECESSITY OF THE MEASURE IN A PECUNIARY LIGHT, AND THE HOPE OF ITS
UTILITY TO HIS SON, RECONCILED SIR THOMAS TO THE EFFORT OF QUITTING THE
REST OF HIS FAMILY, AND OF LEAVING HIS DAUGHTERS TO THE DIRECTION OF
OTHERS AT THEIR PRESENT MOST INTERESTING TIME OF LIFE. HE COULD NOT
THINK LADY BERTRAM QUITE EQUAL TO SUPPLY HIS PLACE WITH THEM, OR RATHER,
TO PERFORM WHAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN HER OWN; BUT, IN MRS. NORRIS'S WATCHFUL
ATTENTION, AND IN EDMUND'S JUDGMENT, HE HAD SUFFICIENT CONFIDENCE TO
MAKE HIM GO WITHOUT FEARS FOR THEIR CONDUCT.

LADY BERTRAM DID NOT AT ALL LIKE TO HAVE HER HUSBAND LEAVE HER; BUT SHE
WAS NOT DISTURBED BY ANY ALARM FOR HIS SAFETY, OR SOLICITUDE FOR HIS
COMFORT, BEING ONE OF THOSE PERSONS WHO THINK NOTHING CAN BE DANGEROUS,
OR DIFFICULT, OR FATIGUING TO ANYBODY BUT THEMSELVES.

THE MISS BERTRAMS WERE MUCH TO BE PITIED ON THE OCCASION: NOT FOR THEIR
SORROW, BUT FOR THEIR WANT OF IT. THEIR FATHER WAS NO OBJECT OF LOVE TO
THEM; HE HAD NEVER SEEMED THE FRIEND OF THEIR PLEASURES, AND HIS ABSENCE
WAS UNHAPPILY MOST WELCOME. THEY WERE RELIEVED BY IT FROM ALL RESTRAINT;
AND WITHOUT AIMING AT ONE GRATIFICATION THAT WOULD PROBABLY HAVE BEEN
FORBIDDEN BY SIR THOMAS, THEY FELT THEMSELVES IMMEDIATELY AT THEIR
OWN DISPOSAL, AND TO HAVE EVERY INDULGENCE WITHIN THEIR REACH. FANNY'S
RELIEF, AND HER CONSCIOUSNESS OF IT, WERE QUITE EQUAL TO HER COUSINS';
BUT A MORE TENDER NATURE SUGGESTED THAT HER FEELINGS WERE UNGRATEFUL,
AND SHE REALLY GRIEVED BECAUSE SHE COULD NOT GRIEVE. "SIR THOMAS, WHO
HAD DONE SO MUCH FOR HER AND HER BROTHERS, AND WHO WAS GONE PERHAPS
NEVER TO RETURN! THAT SHE SHOULD SEE HIM GO WITHOUT A TEAR! IT WAS A
SHAMEFUL INSENSIBILITY." HE HAD SAID TO HER, MOREOVER, ON THE VERY LAST
MORNING, THAT HE HOPED SHE MIGHT SEE WILLIAM AGAIN IN THE COURSE OF THE
ENSUING WINTER, AND HAD CHARGED HER TO WRITE AND INVITE HIM TO MANSFIELD
AS SOON AS THE SQUADRON TO WHICH HE BELONGED SHOULD BE KNOWN TO BE
IN ENGLAND. "THIS WAS SO THOUGHTFUL AND KIND!" AND WOULD HE ONLY HAVE
SMILED UPON HER, AND CALLED HER "MY DEAR FANNY," WHILE HE SAID IT, EVERY
FORMER FROWN OR COLD ADDRESS MIGHT HAVE BEEN FORGOTTEN. BUT HE HAD ENDED
HIS SPEECH IN A WAY TO SINK HER IN SAD MORTIFICATION, BY ADDING, "IF
WILLIAM DOES COME TO MANSFIELD, I HOPE YOU MAY BE ABLE TO CONVINCE HIM
THAT THE MANY YEARS WHICH HAVE PASSED SINCE YOU PARTED HAVE NOT BEEN
SPENT ON YOUR SIDE ENTIRELY WITHOUT IMPROVEMENT; THOUGH, I FEAR, HE MUST
FIND HIS SISTER AT SIXTEEN IN SOME RESPECTS TOO MUCH LIKE HIS SISTER AT
TEN." SHE CRIED BITTERLY OVER THIS REFLECTION WHEN HER UNCLE WAS
GONE; AND HER COUSINS, ON SEEING HER WITH RED EYES, SET HER DOWN AS A
HYPOCRITE.



CHAPTER IV

TOM BERTRAM HAD OF LATE SPENT SO LITTLE OF HIS TIME AT HOME THAT HE
COULD BE ONLY NOMINALLY MISSED; AND LADY BERTRAM WAS SOON ASTONISHED
TO FIND HOW VERY WELL THEY DID EVEN WITHOUT HIS FATHER, HOW WELL EDMUND
COULD SUPPLY HIS PLACE IN CARVING, TALKING TO THE STEWARD, WRITING TO
THE ATTORNEY, SETTLING WITH THE SERVANTS, AND EQUALLY SAVING HER
FROM ALL POSSIBLE FATIGUE OR EXERTION IN EVERY PARTICULAR BUT THAT OF
DIRECTING HER LETTERS.

THE EARLIEST INTELLIGENCE OF THE TRAVELLERS' SAFE ARRIVAL AT ANTIGUA,
AFTER A FAVOURABLE VOYAGE, WAS RECEIVED; THOUGH NOT BEFORE MRS. NORRIS
HAD BEEN INDULGING IN VERY DREADFUL FEARS, AND TRYING TO MAKE EDMUND
PARTICIPATE THEM WHENEVER SHE COULD GET HIM ALONE; AND AS SHE DEPENDED
ON BEING THE FIRST PERSON MADE ACQUAINTED WITH ANY FATAL CATASTROPHE,
SHE HAD ALREADY ARRANGED THE MANNER OF BREAKING IT TO ALL THE OTHERS,
WHEN SIR THOMAS'S ASSURANCES OF THEIR BOTH BEING ALIVE AND WELL MADE IT
NECESSARY TO LAY BY HER AGITATION AND AFFECTIONATE PREPARATORY SPEECHES
FOR A WHILE.

THE WINTER CAME AND PASSED WITHOUT THEIR BEING CALLED FOR; THE ACCOUNTS
CONTINUED PERFECTLY GOOD; AND MRS. NORRIS, IN PROMOTING GAIETIES FOR HER
NIECES, ASSISTING THEIR TOILETS, DISPLAYING THEIR ACCOMPLISHMENTS,
AND LOOKING ABOUT FOR THEIR FUTURE HUSBANDS, HAD SO MUCH TO DO AS, IN
ADDITION TO ALL HER OWN HOUSEHOLD CARES, SOME INTERFERENCE IN THOSE OF
HER SISTER, AND MRS. GRANT'S WASTEFUL DOINGS TO OVERLOOK, LEFT HER VERY
LITTLE OCCASION TO BE OCCUPIED IN FEARS FOR THE ABSENT.

THE MISS BERTRAMS WERE NOW FULLY ESTABLISHED AMONG THE BELLES OF THE
NEIGHBOURHOOD; AND AS THEY JOINED TO BEAUTY AND BRILLIANT ACQUIREMENTS
A MANNER NATURALLY EASY, AND CAREFULLY FORMED TO GENERAL CIVILITY AND
OBLIGINGNESS, THEY POSSESSED ITS FAVOUR AS WELL AS ITS ADMIRATION. THEIR
VANITY WAS IN SUCH GOOD ORDER THAT THEY SEEMED TO BE QUITE FREE FROM IT,
AND GAVE THEMSELVES NO AIRS; WHILE THE PRAISES ATTENDING SUCH BEHAVIOUR,
SECURED AND BROUGHT ROUND BY THEIR AUNT, SERVED TO STRENGTHEN THEM IN
BELIEVING THEY HAD NO FAULTS.

LADY BERTRAM DID NOT GO INTO PUBLIC WITH HER DAUGHTERS. SHE WAS TOO
INDOLENT EVEN TO ACCEPT A MOTHER'S GRATIFICATION IN WITNESSING THEIR
SUCCESS AND ENJOYMENT AT THE EXPENSE OF ANY PERSONAL TROUBLE, AND THE
CHARGE WAS MADE OVER TO HER SISTER, WHO DESIRED NOTHING BETTER THAN A
POST OF SUCH HONOURABLE REPRESENTATION, AND VERY THOROUGHLY RELISHED
THE MEANS IT AFFORDED HER OF MIXING IN SOCIETY WITHOUT HAVING HORSES TO
HIRE.

FANNY HAD NO SHARE IN THE FESTIVITIES OF THE SEASON; BUT SHE ENJOYED
BEING AVOWEDLY USEFUL AS HER AUNT'S COMPANION WHEN THEY CALLED AWAY THE
REST OF THE FAMILY; AND, AS MISS LEE HAD LEFT MANSFIELD, SHE NATURALLY
BECAME EVERYTHING TO LADY BERTRAM DURING THE NIGHT OF A BALL OR A PARTY.
SHE TALKED TO HER, LISTENED TO HER, READ TO HER; AND THE TRANQUILLITY
OF SUCH EVENINGS, HER PERFECT SECURITY IN SUCH A TETE-A-TETE FROM ANY
SOUND OF UNKINDNESS, WAS UNSPEAKABLY WELCOME TO A MIND WHICH HAD SELDOM
KNOWN A PAUSE IN ITS ALARMS OR EMBARRASSMENTS. AS TO HER COUSINS'
GAIETIES, SHE LOVED TO HEAR AN ACCOUNT OF THEM, ESPECIALLY OF THE
BALLS, AND WHOM EDMUND HAD DANCED WITH; BUT THOUGHT TOO LOWLY OF HER
OWN SITUATION TO IMAGINE SHE SHOULD EVER BE ADMITTED TO THE SAME, AND
LISTENED, THEREFORE, WITHOUT AN IDEA OF ANY NEARER CONCERN IN THEM. UPON
THE WHOLE, IT WAS A COMFORTABLE WINTER TO HER; FOR THOUGH IT BROUGHT
NO WILLIAM TO ENGLAND, THE NEVER-FAILING HOPE OF HIS ARRIVAL WAS WORTH
MUCH.

THE ENSUING SPRING DEPRIVED HER OF HER VALUED FRIEND, THE OLD GREY PONY;
AND FOR SOME TIME SHE WAS IN DANGER OF FEELING THE LOSS IN HER HEALTH AS
WELL AS IN HER AFFECTIONS; FOR IN SPITE OF THE ACKNOWLEDGED IMPORTANCE
OF HER RIDING ON HORSE-BACK, NO MEASURES WERE TAKEN FOR MOUNTING HER
AGAIN, "BECAUSE," AS IT WAS OBSERVED BY HER AUNTS, "SHE MIGHT RIDE ONE
OF HER COUSIN'S HORSES AT ANY TIME WHEN THEY DID NOT WANT THEM," AND AS
THE MISS BERTRAMS REGULARLY WANTED THEIR HORSES EVERY FINE DAY, AND HAD
NO IDEA OF CARRYING THEIR OBLIGING MANNERS TO THE SACRIFICE OF ANY REAL
PLEASURE, THAT TIME, OF COURSE, NEVER CAME. THEY TOOK THEIR CHEERFUL
RIDES IN THE FINE MORNINGS OF APRIL AND MAY; AND FANNY EITHER SAT AT
HOME THE WHOLE DAY WITH ONE AUNT, OR WALKED BEYOND HER STRENGTH AT
THE INSTIGATION OF THE OTHER: LADY BERTRAM HOLDING EXERCISE TO BE AS
UNNECESSARY FOR EVERYBODY AS IT WAS UNPLEASANT TO HERSELF; AND MRS.
NORRIS, WHO WAS WALKING ALL DAY, THINKING EVERYBODY OUGHT TO WALK
AS MUCH. EDMUND WAS ABSENT AT THIS TIME, OR THE EVIL WOULD HAVE
BEEN EARLIER REMEDIED. WHEN HE RETURNED, TO UNDERSTAND HOW FANNY WAS
SITUATED, AND PERCEIVED ITS ILL EFFECTS, THERE SEEMED WITH HIM BUT ONE
THING TO BE DONE; AND THAT "FANNY MUST HAVE A HORSE" WAS THE RESOLUTE
DECLARATION WITH WHICH HE OPPOSED WHATEVER COULD BE URGED BY THE
SUPINENESS OF HIS MOTHER, OR THE ECONOMY OF HIS AUNT, TO MAKE IT APPEAR
UNIMPORTANT. MRS. NORRIS COULD NOT HELP THINKING THAT SOME STEADY OLD
THING MIGHT BE FOUND AMONG THE NUMBERS BELONGING TO THE PARK THAT WOULD
DO VASTLY WELL; OR THAT ONE MIGHT BE BORROWED OF THE STEWARD; OR THAT
PERHAPS DR. GRANT MIGHT NOW AND THEN LEND THEM THE PONY HE SENT TO THE
POST. SHE COULD NOT BUT CONSIDER IT AS ABSOLUTELY UNNECESSARY, AND EVEN
IMPROPER, THAT FANNY SHOULD HAVE A REGULAR LADY'S HORSE OF HER OWN, IN
THE STYLE OF HER COUSINS. SHE WAS SURE SIR THOMAS HAD NEVER INTENDED IT:
AND SHE MUST SAY THAT, TO BE MAKING SUCH A PURCHASE IN HIS ABSENCE, AND
ADDING TO THE GREAT EXPENSES OF HIS STABLE, AT A TIME WHEN A LARGE PART
OF HIS INCOME WAS UNSETTLED, SEEMED TO HER VERY UNJUSTIFIABLE. "FANNY
MUST HAVE A HORSE," WAS EDMUND'S ONLY REPLY. MRS. NORRIS COULD NOT SEE
IT IN THE SAME LIGHT. LADY BERTRAM DID: SHE ENTIRELY AGREED WITH HER SON
AS TO THE NECESSITY OF IT, AND AS TO ITS BEING CONSIDERED NECESSARY BY
HIS FATHER; SHE ONLY PLEADED AGAINST THERE BEING ANY HURRY; SHE ONLY
WANTED HIM TO WAIT TILL SIR THOMAS'S RETURN, AND THEN SIR THOMAS MIGHT
SETTLE IT ALL HIMSELF. HE WOULD BE AT HOME IN SEPTEMBER, AND WHERE WOULD
BE THE HARM OF ONLY WAITING TILL SEPTEMBER?

THOUGH EDMUND WAS MUCH MORE DISPLEASED WITH HIS AUNT THAN WITH HIS
MOTHER, AS EVINCING LEAST REGARD FOR HER NIECE, HE COULD NOT HELP PAYING
MORE ATTENTION TO WHAT SHE SAID; AND AT LENGTH DETERMINED ON A METHOD OF
PROCEEDING WHICH WOULD OBVIATE THE RISK OF HIS FATHER'S THINKING HE
HAD DONE TOO MUCH, AND AT THE SAME TIME PROCURE FOR FANNY THE IMMEDIATE
MEANS OF EXERCISE, WHICH HE COULD NOT BEAR SHE SHOULD BE WITHOUT. HE HAD
THREE HORSES OF HIS OWN, BUT NOT ONE THAT WOULD CARRY A WOMAN. TWO
OF THEM WERE HUNTERS; THE THIRD, A USEFUL ROAD-HORSE: THIS THIRD HE
RESOLVED TO EXCHANGE FOR ONE THAT HIS COUSIN MIGHT RIDE; HE KNEW WHERE
SUCH A ONE WAS TO BE MET WITH; AND HAVING ONCE MADE UP HIS MIND, THE
WHOLE BUSINESS WAS SOON COMPLETED. THE NEW MARE PROVED A TREASURE; WITH
A VERY LITTLE TROUBLE SHE BECAME EXACTLY CALCULATED FOR THE PURPOSE,
AND FANNY WAS THEN PUT IN ALMOST FULL POSSESSION OF HER. SHE HAD NOT
SUPPOSED BEFORE THAT ANYTHING COULD EVER SUIT HER LIKE THE OLD GREY
PONY; BUT HER DELIGHT IN EDMUND'S MARE WAS FAR BEYOND ANY FORMER
PLEASURE OF THE SORT; AND THE ADDITION IT WAS EVER RECEIVING IN THE
CONSIDERATION OF THAT KINDNESS FROM WHICH HER PLEASURE SPRUNG, WAS
BEYOND ALL HER WORDS TO EXPRESS. SHE REGARDED HER COUSIN AS AN EXAMPLE
OF EVERYTHING GOOD AND GREAT, AS POSSESSING WORTH WHICH NO ONE BUT
HERSELF COULD EVER APPRECIATE, AND AS ENTITLED TO SUCH GRATITUDE FROM
HER AS NO FEELINGS COULD BE STRONG ENOUGH TO PAY. HER SENTIMENTS TOWARDS
HIM WERE COMPOUNDED OF ALL THAT WAS RESPECTFUL, GRATEFUL, CONFIDING, AND
TENDER.

AS THE HORSE CONTINUED IN NAME, AS WELL AS FACT, THE PROPERTY OF EDMUND,
MRS. NORRIS COULD TOLERATE ITS BEING FOR FANNY'S USE; AND HAD LADY
BERTRAM EVER THOUGHT ABOUT HER OWN OBJECTION AGAIN, HE MIGHT HAVE
BEEN EXCUSED IN HER EYES FOR NOT WAITING TILL SIR THOMAS'S RETURN IN
SEPTEMBER, FOR WHEN SEPTEMBER CAME SIR THOMAS WAS STILL ABROAD, AND
WITHOUT ANY NEAR PROSPECT OF FINISHING HIS BUSINESS. UNFAVOURABLE
CIRCUMSTANCES HAD SUDDENLY ARISEN AT A MOMENT WHEN HE WAS BEGINNING TO
TURN ALL HIS THOUGHTS TOWARDS ENGLAND; AND THE VERY GREAT UNCERTAINTY
IN WHICH EVERYTHING WAS THEN INVOLVED DETERMINED HIM ON SENDING HOME HIS
SON, AND WAITING THE FINAL ARRANGEMENT BY HIMSELF. TOM ARRIVED SAFELY,
BRINGING AN EXCELLENT ACCOUNT OF HIS FATHER'S HEALTH; BUT TO VERY LITTLE
PURPOSE, AS FAR AS MRS. NORRIS WAS CONCERNED. SIR THOMAS'S SENDING AWAY
HIS SON SEEMED TO HER SO LIKE A PARENT'S CARE, UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF A
FOREBODING OF EVIL TO HIMSELF, THAT SHE COULD NOT HELP FEELING DREADFUL
PRESENTIMENTS; AND AS THE LONG EVENINGS OF AUTUMN CAME ON, WAS SO
TERRIBLY HAUNTED BY THESE IDEAS, IN THE SAD SOLITARINESS OF HER COTTAGE,
AS TO BE OBLIGED TO TAKE DAILY REFUGE IN THE DINING-ROOM OF THE PARK.
THE RETURN OF WINTER ENGAGEMENTS, HOWEVER, WAS NOT WITHOUT ITS EFFECT;
AND IN THE COURSE OF THEIR PROGRESS, HER MIND BECAME SO PLEASANTLY
OCCUPIED IN SUPERINTENDING THE FORTUNES OF HER ELDEST NIECE, AS
TOLERABLY TO QUIET HER NERVES. "IF POOR SIR THOMAS WERE FATED NEVER TO
RETURN, IT WOULD BE PECULIARLY CONSOLING TO SEE THEIR DEAR MARIA WELL
MARRIED," SHE VERY OFTEN THOUGHT; ALWAYS WHEN THEY WERE IN THE COMPANY
OF MEN OF FORTUNE, AND PARTICULARLY ON THE INTRODUCTION OF A YOUNG MAN
WHO HAD RECENTLY SUCCEEDED TO ONE OF THE LARGEST ESTATES AND FINEST
PLACES IN THE COUNTRY.

MR. RUSHWORTH WAS FROM THE FIRST STRUCK WITH THE BEAUTY OF MISS BERTRAM,
AND, BEING INCLINED TO MARRY, SOON FANCIED HIMSELF IN LOVE. HE WAS
A HEAVY YOUNG MAN, WITH NOT MORE THAN COMMON SENSE; BUT AS THERE WAS
NOTHING DISAGREEABLE IN HIS FIGURE OR ADDRESS, THE YOUNG LADY WAS WELL
PLEASED WITH HER CONQUEST. BEING NOW IN HER TWENTY-FIRST YEAR, MARIA
BERTRAM WAS BEGINNING TO THINK MATRIMONY A DUTY; AND AS A MARRIAGE WITH
MR. RUSHWORTH WOULD GIVE HER THE ENJOYMENT OF A LARGER INCOME THAN HER
FATHER'S, AS WELL AS ENSURE HER THE HOUSE IN TOWN, WHICH WAS NOW A PRIME
OBJECT, IT BECAME, BY THE SAME RULE OF MORAL OBLIGATION, HER EVIDENT
DUTY TO MARRY MR. RUSHWORTH IF SHE COULD. MRS. NORRIS WAS MOST ZEALOUS
IN PROMOTING THE MATCH, BY EVERY SUGGESTION AND CONTRIVANCE LIKELY TO
ENHANCE ITS DESIRABLENESS TO EITHER PARTY; AND, AMONG OTHER MEANS, BY
SEEKING AN INTIMACY WITH THE GENTLEMAN'S MOTHER, WHO AT PRESENT LIVED
WITH HIM, AND TO WHOM SHE EVEN FORCED LADY BERTRAM TO GO THROUGH TEN
MILES OF INDIFFERENT ROAD TO PAY A MORNING VISIT. IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE
A GOOD UNDERSTANDING TOOK PLACE BETWEEN THIS LADY AND HERSELF. MRS.
RUSHWORTH ACKNOWLEDGED HERSELF VERY DESIROUS THAT HER SON SHOULD MARRY,
AND DECLARED THAT OF ALL THE YOUNG LADIES SHE HAD EVER SEEN, MISS
BERTRAM SEEMED, BY HER AMIABLE QUALITIES AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS, THE BEST
ADAPTED TO MAKE HIM HAPPY. MRS. NORRIS ACCEPTED THE COMPLIMENT,
AND ADMIRED THE NICE DISCERNMENT OF CHARACTER WHICH COULD SO WELL
DISTINGUISH MERIT. MARIA WAS INDEED THE PRIDE AND DELIGHT OF THEM
ALL--PERFECTLY FAULTLESS--AN ANGEL; AND, OF COURSE, SO SURROUNDED BY
ADMIRERS, MUST BE DIFFICULT IN HER CHOICE: BUT YET, AS FAR AS MRS.
NORRIS COULD ALLOW HERSELF TO DECIDE ON SO SHORT AN ACQUAINTANCE, MR.
RUSHWORTH APPEARED PRECISELY THE YOUNG MAN TO DESERVE AND ATTACH HER.

AFTER DANCING WITH EACH OTHER AT A PROPER NUMBER OF BALLS, THE YOUNG
PEOPLE JUSTIFIED THESE OPINIONS, AND AN ENGAGEMENT, WITH A DUE REFERENCE
TO THE ABSENT SIR THOMAS, WAS ENTERED INTO, MUCH TO THE SATISFACTION
OF THEIR RESPECTIVE FAMILIES, AND OF THE GENERAL LOOKERS-ON OF THE
NEIGHBOURHOOD, WHO HAD, FOR MANY WEEKS PAST, FELT THE EXPEDIENCY OF MR.
RUSHWORTH'S MARRYING MISS BERTRAM.

IT WAS SOME MONTHS BEFORE SIR THOMAS'S CONSENT COULD BE RECEIVED; BUT,
IN THE MEANWHILE, AS NO ONE FELT A DOUBT OF HIS MOST CORDIAL PLEASURE
IN THE CONNEXION, THE INTERCOURSE OF THE TWO FAMILIES WAS CARRIED
ON WITHOUT RESTRAINT, AND NO OTHER ATTEMPT MADE AT SECRECY THAN MRS.
NORRIS'S TALKING OF IT EVERYWHERE AS A MATTER NOT TO BE TALKED OF AT
PRESENT.

EDMUND WAS THE ONLY ONE OF THE FAMILY WHO COULD SEE A FAULT IN THE
BUSINESS; BUT NO REPRESENTATION OF HIS AUNT'S COULD INDUCE HIM TO FIND
MR. RUSHWORTH A DESIRABLE COMPANION. HE COULD ALLOW HIS SISTER TO BE
THE BEST JUDGE OF HER OWN HAPPINESS, BUT HE WAS NOT PLEASED THAT HER
HAPPINESS SHOULD CENTRE IN A LARGE INCOME; NOR COULD HE REFRAIN FROM
OFTEN SAYING TO HIMSELF, IN MR. RUSHWORTH'S COMPANY--"IF THIS MAN HAD
NOT TWELVE THOUSAND A YEAR, HE WOULD BE A VERY STUPID FELLOW."

SIR THOMAS, HOWEVER, WAS TRULY HAPPY IN THE PROSPECT OF AN ALLIANCE
SO UNQUESTIONABLY ADVANTAGEOUS, AND OF WHICH HE HEARD NOTHING BUT THE
PERFECTLY GOOD AND AGREEABLE. IT WAS A CONNEXION EXACTLY OF THE RIGHT
SORT--IN THE SAME COUNTY, AND THE SAME INTEREST--AND HIS MOST HEARTY
CONCURRENCE WAS CONVEYED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. HE ONLY CONDITIONED THAT
THE MARRIAGE SHOULD NOT TAKE PLACE BEFORE HIS RETURN, WHICH HE WAS AGAIN
LOOKING EAGERLY FORWARD TO. HE WROTE IN APRIL, AND HAD STRONG HOPES
OF SETTLING EVERYTHING TO HIS ENTIRE SATISFACTION, AND LEAVING ANTIGUA
BEFORE THE END OF THE SUMMER.

SUCH WAS THE STATE OF AFFAIRS IN THE MONTH OF JULY; AND FANNY HAD JUST
REACHED HER EIGHTEENTH YEAR, WHEN THE SOCIETY OF THE VILLAGE RECEIVED
AN ADDITION IN THE BROTHER AND SISTER OF MRS. GRANT, A MR. AND MISS
CRAWFORD, THE CHILDREN OF HER MOTHER BY A SECOND MARRIAGE. THEY WERE
YOUNG PEOPLE OF FORTUNE. THE SON HAD A GOOD ESTATE IN NORFOLK, THE
DAUGHTER TWENTY THOUSAND POUNDS. AS CHILDREN, THEIR SISTER HAD BEEN
ALWAYS VERY FOND OF THEM; BUT, AS HER OWN MARRIAGE HAD BEEN SOON
FOLLOWED BY THE DEATH OF THEIR COMMON PARENT, WHICH LEFT THEM TO THE
CARE OF A BROTHER OF THEIR FATHER, OF WHOM MRS. GRANT KNEW NOTHING, SHE
HAD SCARCELY SEEN THEM SINCE. IN THEIR UNCLE'S HOUSE THEY HAD FOUND A
KIND HOME. ADMIRAL AND MRS. CRAWFORD, THOUGH AGREEING IN NOTHING ELSE,
WERE UNITED IN AFFECTION FOR THESE CHILDREN, OR, AT LEAST, WERE NO
FARTHER ADVERSE IN THEIR FEELINGS THAN THAT EACH HAD THEIR FAVOURITE, TO
WHOM THEY SHOWED THE GREATEST FONDNESS OF THE TWO. THE ADMIRAL DELIGHTED
IN THE BOY, MRS. CRAWFORD DOTED ON THE GIRL; AND IT WAS THE LADY'S DEATH
WHICH NOW OBLIGED HER PROTEGEE, AFTER SOME MONTHS' FURTHER TRIAL AT
HER UNCLE'S HOUSE, TO FIND ANOTHER HOME. ADMIRAL CRAWFORD WAS A MAN OF
VICIOUS CONDUCT, WHO CHOSE, INSTEAD OF RETAINING HIS NIECE, TO BRING HIS
MISTRESS UNDER HIS OWN ROOF; AND TO THIS MRS. GRANT WAS INDEBTED FOR HER
SISTER'S PROPOSAL OF COMING TO HER, A MEASURE QUITE AS WELCOME ON ONE
SIDE AS IT COULD BE EXPEDIENT ON THE OTHER; FOR MRS. GRANT, HAVING BY
THIS TIME RUN THROUGH THE USUAL RESOURCES OF LADIES RESIDING IN THE
COUNTRY WITHOUT A FAMILY OF CHILDREN--HAVING MORE THAN FILLED HER
FAVOURITE SITTING-ROOM WITH PRETTY FURNITURE, AND MADE A CHOICE
COLLECTION OF PLANTS AND POULTRY--WAS VERY MUCH IN WANT OF SOME VARIETY
AT HOME. THE ARRIVAL, THEREFORE, OF A SISTER WHOM SHE HAD ALWAYS LOVED,
AND NOW HOPED TO RETAIN WITH HER AS LONG AS SHE REMAINED SINGLE, WAS
HIGHLY AGREEABLE; AND HER CHIEF ANXIETY WAS LEST MANSFIELD SHOULD NOT
SATISFY THE HABITS OF A YOUNG WOMAN WHO HAD BEEN MOSTLY USED TO LONDON.

MISS CRAWFORD WAS NOT ENTIRELY FREE FROM SIMILAR APPREHENSIONS, THOUGH
THEY AROSE PRINCIPALLY FROM DOUBTS OF HER SISTER'S STYLE OF LIVING AND
TONE OF SOCIETY; AND IT WAS NOT TILL AFTER SHE HAD TRIED IN VAIN TO
PERSUADE HER BROTHER TO SETTLE WITH HER AT HIS OWN COUNTRY HOUSE,
THAT SHE COULD RESOLVE TO HAZARD HERSELF AMONG HER OTHER RELATIONS. TO
ANYTHING LIKE A PERMANENCE OF ABODE, OR LIMITATION OF SOCIETY, HENRY
CRAWFORD HAD, UNLUCKILY, A GREAT DISLIKE: HE COULD NOT ACCOMMODATE HIS
SISTER IN AN ARTICLE OF SUCH IMPORTANCE; BUT HE ESCORTED HER, WITH THE
UTMOST KINDNESS, INTO NORTHAMPTONSHIRE, AND AS READILY ENGAGED TO FETCH
HER AWAY AGAIN, AT HALF AN HOUR'S NOTICE, WHENEVER SHE WERE WEARY OF THE
PLACE.

THE MEETING WAS VERY SATISFACTORY ON EACH SIDE. MISS CRAWFORD FOUND A
SISTER WITHOUT PRECISENESS OR RUSTICITY, A SISTER'S HUSBAND WHO LOOKED
THE GENTLEMAN, AND A HOUSE COMMODIOUS AND WELL FITTED UP; AND MRS. GRANT
RECEIVED IN THOSE WHOM SHE HOPED TO LOVE BETTER THAN EVER A YOUNG MAN
AND WOMAN OF VERY PREPOSSESSING APPEARANCE. MARY CRAWFORD WAS REMARKABLY
PRETTY; HENRY, THOUGH NOT HANDSOME, HAD AIR AND COUNTENANCE; THE MANNERS
OF BOTH WERE LIVELY AND PLEASANT, AND MRS. GRANT IMMEDIATELY GAVE THEM
CREDIT FOR EVERYTHING ELSE. SHE WAS DELIGHTED WITH EACH, BUT MARY WAS
HER DEAREST OBJECT; AND HAVING NEVER BEEN ABLE TO GLORY IN BEAUTY OF HER
OWN, SHE THOROUGHLY ENJOYED THE POWER OF BEING PROUD OF HER SISTER'S.
SHE HAD NOT WAITED HER ARRIVAL TO LOOK OUT FOR A SUITABLE MATCH FOR HER:
SHE HAD FIXED ON TOM BERTRAM; THE ELDEST SON OF A BARONET WAS NOT TOO
GOOD FOR A GIRL OF TWENTY THOUSAND POUNDS, WITH ALL THE ELEGANCE
AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS WHICH MRS. GRANT FORESAW IN HER; AND BEING A
WARM-HEARTED, UNRESERVED WOMAN, MARY HAD NOT BEEN THREE HOURS IN THE
HOUSE BEFORE SHE TOLD HER WHAT SHE HAD PLANNED.

MISS CRAWFORD WAS GLAD TO FIND A FAMILY OF SUCH CONSEQUENCE SO VERY NEAR
THEM, AND NOT AT ALL DISPLEASED EITHER AT HER SISTER'S EARLY CARE, OR
THE CHOICE IT HAD FALLEN ON. MATRIMONY WAS HER OBJECT, PROVIDED SHE
COULD MARRY WELL: AND HAVING SEEN MR. BERTRAM IN TOWN, SHE KNEW THAT
OBJECTION COULD NO MORE BE MADE TO HIS PERSON THAN TO HIS SITUATION IN
LIFE. WHILE SHE TREATED IT AS A JOKE, THEREFORE, SHE DID NOT FORGET TO
THINK OF IT SERIOUSLY. THE SCHEME WAS SOON REPEATED TO HENRY.

"AND NOW," ADDED MRS. GRANT, "I HAVE THOUGHT OF SOMETHING TO MAKE IT
COMPLETE. I SHOULD DEARLY LOVE TO SETTLE YOU BOTH IN THIS COUNTRY; AND
THEREFORE, HENRY, YOU SHALL MARRY THE YOUNGEST MISS BERTRAM, A NICE,
HANDSOME, GOOD-HUMOURED, ACCOMPLISHED GIRL, WHO WILL MAKE YOU VERY
HAPPY."

HENRY BOWED AND THANKED HER.

"MY DEAR SISTER," SAID MARY, "IF YOU CAN PERSUADE HIM INTO ANYTHING
OF THE SORT, IT WILL BE A FRESH MATTER OF DELIGHT TO ME TO FIND MYSELF
ALLIED TO ANYBODY SO CLEVER, AND I SHALL ONLY REGRET THAT YOU HAVE
NOT HALF A DOZEN DAUGHTERS TO DISPOSE OF. IF YOU CAN PERSUADE HENRY
TO MARRY, YOU MUST HAVE THE ADDRESS OF A FRENCHWOMAN. ALL THAT ENGLISH
ABILITIES CAN DO HAS BEEN TRIED ALREADY. I HAVE THREE VERY PARTICULAR
FRIENDS WHO HAVE BEEN ALL DYING FOR HIM IN THEIR TURN; AND THE PAINS
WHICH THEY, THEIR MOTHERS (VERY CLEVER WOMEN), AS WELL AS MY DEAR AUNT
AND MYSELF, HAVE TAKEN TO REASON, COAX, OR TRICK HIM INTO MARRYING, IS
INCONCEIVABLE! HE IS THE MOST HORRIBLE FLIRT THAT CAN BE IMAGINED. IF
YOUR MISS BERTRAMS DO NOT LIKE TO HAVE THEIR HEARTS BROKE, LET THEM
AVOID HENRY."

"MY DEAR BROTHER, I WILL NOT BELIEVE THIS OF YOU."

"NO, I AM SURE YOU ARE TOO GOOD. YOU WILL BE KINDER THAN MARY. YOU
WILL ALLOW FOR THE DOUBTS OF YOUTH AND INEXPERIENCE. I AM OF A CAUTIOUS
TEMPER, AND UNWILLING TO RISK MY HAPPINESS IN A HURRY. NOBODY CAN
THINK MORE HIGHLY OF THE MATRIMONIAL STATE THAN MYSELF. I CONSIDER THE
BLESSING OF A WIFE AS MOST JUSTLY DESCRIBED IN THOSE DISCREET LINES OF
THE POET--'HEAVEN'S LAST BEST GIFT.'"

"THERE, MRS. GRANT, YOU SEE HOW HE DWELLS ON ONE WORD, AND ONLY LOOK
AT HIS SMILE. I ASSURE YOU HE IS VERY DETESTABLE; THE ADMIRAL'S LESSONS
HAVE QUITE SPOILED HIM."

"I PAY VERY LITTLE REGARD," SAID MRS. GRANT, "TO WHAT ANY YOUNG PERSON
SAYS ON THE SUBJECT OF MARRIAGE. IF THEY PROFESS A DISINCLINATION FOR
IT, I ONLY SET IT DOWN THAT THEY HAVE NOT YET SEEN THE RIGHT PERSON."

DR. GRANT LAUGHINGLY CONGRATULATED MISS CRAWFORD ON FEELING NO
DISINCLINATION TO THE STATE HERSELF.

"OH YES! I AM NOT AT ALL ASHAMED OF IT. I WOULD HAVE EVERYBODY MARRY IF
THEY CAN DO IT PROPERLY: I DO NOT LIKE TO HAVE PEOPLE THROW THEMSELVES
AWAY; BUT EVERYBODY SHOULD MARRY AS SOON AS THEY CAN DO IT TO
ADVANTAGE."



CHAPTER V

THE YOUNG PEOPLE WERE PLEASED WITH EACH OTHER FROM THE FIRST. ON EACH
SIDE THERE WAS MUCH TO ATTRACT, AND THEIR ACQUAINTANCE SOON PROMISED AS
EARLY AN INTIMACY AS GOOD MANNERS WOULD WARRANT. MISS CRAWFORD'S BEAUTY
DID HER NO DISSERVICE WITH THE MISS BERTRAMS. THEY WERE TOO HANDSOME
THEMSELVES TO DISLIKE ANY WOMAN FOR BEING SO TOO, AND WERE ALMOST AS
MUCH CHARMED AS THEIR BROTHERS WITH HER LIVELY DARK EYE, CLEAR BROWN
COMPLEXION, AND GENERAL PRETTINESS. HAD SHE BEEN TALL, FULL FORMED, AND
FAIR, IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN MORE OF A TRIAL: BUT AS IT WAS, THERE COULD BE
NO COMPARISON; AND SHE WAS MOST ALLOWABLY A SWEET, PRETTY GIRL, WHILE
THEY WERE THE FINEST YOUNG WOMEN IN THE COUNTRY.

HER BROTHER WAS NOT HANDSOME: NO, WHEN THEY FIRST SAW HIM HE WAS
ABSOLUTELY PLAIN, BLACK AND PLAIN; BUT STILL HE WAS THE GENTLEMAN, WITH
A PLEASING ADDRESS. THE SECOND MEETING PROVED HIM NOT SO VERY PLAIN:
HE WAS PLAIN, TO BE SURE, BUT THEN HE HAD SO MUCH COUNTENANCE, AND HIS
TEETH WERE SO GOOD, AND HE WAS SO WELL MADE, THAT ONE SOON FORGOT HE WAS
PLAIN; AND AFTER A THIRD INTERVIEW, AFTER DINING IN COMPANY WITH HIM AT
THE PARSONAGE, HE WAS NO LONGER ALLOWED TO BE CALLED SO BY ANYBODY. HE
WAS, IN FACT, THE MOST AGREEABLE YOUNG MAN THE SISTERS HAD EVER KNOWN,
AND THEY WERE EQUALLY DELIGHTED WITH HIM. MISS BERTRAM'S ENGAGEMENT MADE
HIM IN EQUITY THE PROPERTY OF JULIA, OF WHICH JULIA WAS FULLY AWARE; AND
BEFORE HE HAD BEEN AT MANSFIELD A WEEK, SHE WAS QUITE READY TO BE FALLEN
IN LOVE WITH.

MARIA'S NOTIONS ON THE SUBJECT WERE MORE CONFUSED AND INDISTINCT. SHE
DID NOT WANT TO SEE OR UNDERSTAND. "THERE COULD BE NO HARM IN HER LIKING
AN AGREEABLE MAN--EVERYBODY KNEW HER SITUATION--MR. CRAWFORD MUST TAKE
CARE OF HIMSELF." MR. CRAWFORD DID NOT MEAN TO BE IN ANY DANGER! THE
MISS BERTRAMS WERE WORTH PLEASING, AND WERE READY TO BE PLEASED; AND HE
BEGAN WITH NO OBJECT BUT OF MAKING THEM LIKE HIM. HE DID NOT WANT THEM
TO DIE OF LOVE; BUT WITH SENSE AND TEMPER WHICH OUGHT TO HAVE MADE HIM
JUDGE AND FEEL BETTER, HE ALLOWED HIMSELF GREAT LATITUDE ON SUCH POINTS.

"I LIKE YOUR MISS BERTRAMS EXCEEDINGLY, SISTER," SAID HE, AS HE RETURNED
FROM ATTENDING THEM TO THEIR CARRIAGE AFTER THE SAID DINNER VISIT; "THEY
ARE VERY ELEGANT, AGREEABLE GIRLS."

"SO THEY ARE INDEED, AND I AM DELIGHTED TO HEAR YOU SAY IT. BUT YOU LIKE
JULIA BEST."

"OH YES! I LIKE JULIA BEST."

"BUT DO YOU REALLY? FOR MISS BERTRAM IS IN GENERAL THOUGHT THE
HANDSOMEST."

"SO I SHOULD SUPPOSE. SHE HAS THE ADVANTAGE IN EVERY FEATURE, AND I
PREFER HER COUNTENANCE; BUT I LIKE JULIA BEST; MISS BERTRAM IS CERTAINLY
THE HANDSOMEST, AND I HAVE FOUND HER THE MOST AGREEABLE, BUT I SHALL
ALWAYS LIKE JULIA BEST, BECAUSE YOU ORDER ME."

"I SHALL NOT TALK TO YOU, HENRY, BUT I KNOW YOU WILL LIKE HER BEST AT
LAST."

"DO NOT I TELL YOU THAT I LIKE HER BEST AT FIRST?"

"AND BESIDES, MISS BERTRAM IS ENGAGED. REMEMBER THAT, MY DEAR BROTHER.
HER CHOICE IS MADE."

"YES, AND I LIKE HER THE BETTER FOR IT. AN ENGAGED WOMAN IS ALWAYS MORE
AGREEABLE THAN A DISENGAGED. SHE IS SATISFIED WITH HERSELF. HER CARES
ARE OVER, AND SHE FEELS THAT SHE MAY EXERT ALL HER POWERS OF PLEASING
WITHOUT SUSPICION. ALL IS SAFE WITH A LADY ENGAGED: NO HARM CAN BE
DONE."

"WHY, AS TO THAT, MR. RUSHWORTH IS A VERY GOOD SORT OF YOUNG MAN, AND IT
IS A GREAT MATCH FOR HER."

"BUT MISS BERTRAM DOES NOT CARE THREE STRAWS FOR HIM; THAT IS YOUR
OPINION OF YOUR INTIMATE FRIEND. I DO NOT SUBSCRIBE TO IT. I AM SURE
MISS BERTRAM IS VERY MUCH ATTACHED TO MR. RUSHWORTH. I COULD SEE IT IN
HER EYES, WHEN HE WAS MENTIONED. I THINK TOO WELL OF MISS BERTRAM TO
SUPPOSE SHE WOULD EVER GIVE HER HAND WITHOUT HER HEART."

"MARY, HOW SHALL WE MANAGE HIM?"

"WE MUST LEAVE HIM TO HIMSELF, I BELIEVE. TALKING DOES NO GOOD. HE WILL
BE TAKEN IN AT LAST."

"BUT I WOULD NOT HAVE HIM TAKEN IN; I WOULD NOT HAVE HIM DUPED; I
WOULD HAVE IT ALL FAIR AND HONOURABLE."

"OH DEAR! LET HIM STAND HIS CHANCE AND BE TAKEN IN. IT WILL DO JUST AS
WELL. EVERYBODY IS TAKEN IN AT SOME PERIOD OR OTHER."

"NOT ALWAYS IN MARRIAGE, DEAR MARY."

"IN MARRIAGE ESPECIALLY. WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO SUCH OF THE PRESENT
COMPANY AS CHANCE TO BE MARRIED, MY DEAR MRS. GRANT, THERE IS NOT ONE IN
A HUNDRED OF EITHER SEX WHO IS NOT TAKEN IN WHEN THEY MARRY. LOOK WHERE
I WILL, I SEE THAT IT IS SO; AND I FEEL THAT IT MUST BE SO, WHEN I
CONSIDER THAT IT IS, OF ALL TRANSACTIONS, THE ONE IN WHICH PEOPLE EXPECT
MOST FROM OTHERS, AND ARE LEAST HONEST THEMSELVES."

"AH! YOU HAVE BEEN IN A BAD SCHOOL FOR MATRIMONY, IN HILL STREET."

"MY POOR AUNT HAD CERTAINLY LITTLE CAUSE TO LOVE THE STATE; BUT,
HOWEVER, SPEAKING FROM MY OWN OBSERVATION, IT IS A MANOEUVRING BUSINESS.
I KNOW SO MANY WHO HAVE MARRIED IN THE FULL EXPECTATION AND CONFIDENCE
OF SOME ONE PARTICULAR ADVANTAGE IN THE CONNEXION, OR ACCOMPLISHMENT, OR
GOOD QUALITY IN THE PERSON, WHO HAVE FOUND THEMSELVES ENTIRELY DECEIVED,
AND BEEN OBLIGED TO PUT UP WITH EXACTLY THE REVERSE. WHAT IS THIS BUT A
TAKE IN?"

"MY DEAR CHILD, THERE MUST BE A LITTLE IMAGINATION HERE. I BEG YOUR
PARDON, BUT I CANNOT QUITE BELIEVE YOU. DEPEND UPON IT, YOU SEE BUT
HALF. YOU SEE THE EVIL, BUT YOU DO NOT SEE THE CONSOLATION. THERE WILL
BE LITTLE RUBS AND DISAPPOINTMENTS EVERYWHERE, AND WE ARE ALL APT TO
EXPECT TOO MUCH; BUT THEN, IF ONE SCHEME OF HAPPINESS FAILS, HUMAN
NATURE TURNS TO ANOTHER; IF THE FIRST CALCULATION IS WRONG, WE MAKE
A SECOND BETTER: WE FIND COMFORT SOMEWHERE--AND THOSE EVIL-MINDED
OBSERVERS, DEAREST MARY, WHO MAKE MUCH OF A LITTLE, ARE MORE TAKEN IN
AND DECEIVED THAN THE PARTIES THEMSELVES."

"WELL DONE, SISTER! I HONOUR YOUR ESPRIT DU CORPS. WHEN I AM A
WIFE, I MEAN TO BE JUST AS STAUNCH MYSELF; AND I WISH MY FRIENDS IN
GENERAL WOULD BE SO TOO. IT WOULD SAVE ME MANY A HEARTACHE."

"YOU ARE AS BAD AS YOUR BROTHER, MARY; BUT WE WILL CURE YOU BOTH.
MANSFIELD SHALL CURE YOU BOTH, AND WITHOUT ANY TAKING IN. STAY WITH US,
AND WE WILL CURE YOU."

THE CRAWFORDS, WITHOUT WANTING TO BE CURED, WERE VERY WILLING TO STAY.
MARY WAS SATISFIED WITH THE PARSONAGE AS A PRESENT HOME, AND HENRY
EQUALLY READY TO LENGTHEN HIS VISIT. HE HAD COME, INTENDING TO SPEND
ONLY A FEW DAYS WITH THEM; BUT MANSFIELD PROMISED WELL, AND THERE WAS
NOTHING TO CALL HIM ELSEWHERE. IT DELIGHTED MRS. GRANT TO KEEP THEM BOTH
WITH HER, AND DR. GRANT WAS EXCEEDINGLY WELL CONTENTED TO HAVE IT SO: A
TALKING PRETTY YOUNG WOMAN LIKE MISS CRAWFORD IS ALWAYS PLEASANT SOCIETY
TO AN INDOLENT, STAY-AT-HOME MAN; AND MR. CRAWFORD'S BEING HIS GUEST WAS
AN EXCUSE FOR DRINKING CLARET EVERY DAY.

THE MISS BERTRAMS' ADMIRATION OF MR. CRAWFORD WAS MORE RAPTUROUS THAN
ANYTHING WHICH MISS CRAWFORD'S HABITS MADE HER LIKELY TO FEEL. SHE
ACKNOWLEDGED, HOWEVER, THAT THE MR. BERTRAMS WERE VERY FINE YOUNG MEN,
THAT TWO SUCH YOUNG MEN WERE NOT OFTEN SEEN TOGETHER EVEN IN LONDON, AND
THAT THEIR MANNERS, PARTICULARLY THOSE OF THE ELDEST, WERE VERY GOOD.
HE HAD BEEN MUCH IN LONDON, AND HAD MORE LIVELINESS AND GALLANTRY THAN
EDMUND, AND MUST, THEREFORE, BE PREFERRED; AND, INDEED, HIS BEING THE
ELDEST WAS ANOTHER STRONG CLAIM. SHE HAD FELT AN EARLY PRESENTIMENT THAT
SHE SHOULD LIKE THE ELDEST BEST. SHE KNEW IT WAS HER WAY.

TOM BERTRAM MUST HAVE BEEN THOUGHT PLEASANT, INDEED, AT ANY RATE; HE WAS
THE SORT OF YOUNG MAN TO BE GENERALLY LIKED, HIS AGREEABLENESS WAS OF
THE KIND TO BE OFTENER FOUND AGREEABLE THAN SOME ENDOWMENTS OF A HIGHER
STAMP, FOR HE HAD EASY MANNERS, EXCELLENT SPIRITS, A LARGE ACQUAINTANCE,
AND A GREAT DEAL TO SAY; AND THE REVERSION OF MANSFIELD PARK, AND A
BARONETCY, DID NO HARM TO ALL THIS. MISS CRAWFORD SOON FELT THAT HE AND
HIS SITUATION MIGHT DO. SHE LOOKED ABOUT HER WITH DUE CONSIDERATION, AND
FOUND ALMOST EVERYTHING IN HIS FAVOUR: A PARK, A REAL PARK, FIVE MILES
ROUND, A SPACIOUS MODERN-BUILT HOUSE, SO WELL PLACED AND WELL SCREENED
AS TO DESERVE TO BE IN ANY COLLECTION OF ENGRAVINGS OF GENTLEMEN'S
SEATS IN THE KINGDOM, AND WANTING ONLY TO BE COMPLETELY NEW
FURNISHED--PLEASANT SISTERS, A QUIET MOTHER, AND AN AGREEABLE MAN
HIMSELF--WITH THE ADVANTAGE OF BEING TIED UP FROM MUCH GAMING AT PRESENT
BY A PROMISE TO HIS FATHER, AND OF BEING SIR THOMAS HEREAFTER. IT
MIGHT DO VERY WELL; SHE BELIEVED SHE SHOULD ACCEPT HIM; AND SHE BEGAN
ACCORDINGLY TO INTEREST HERSELF A LITTLE ABOUT THE HORSE WHICH HE HAD TO
RUN AT THE B---- RACES.

THESE RACES WERE TO CALL HIM AWAY NOT LONG AFTER THEIR ACQUAINTANCE
BEGAN; AND AS IT APPEARED THAT THE FAMILY DID NOT, FROM HIS USUAL GOINGS
ON, EXPECT HIM BACK AGAIN FOR MANY WEEKS, IT WOULD BRING HIS PASSION TO
AN EARLY PROOF. MUCH WAS SAID ON HIS SIDE TO INDUCE HER TO ATTEND THE
RACES, AND SCHEMES WERE MADE FOR A LARGE PARTY TO THEM, WITH ALL THE
EAGERNESS OF INCLINATION, BUT IT WOULD ONLY DO TO BE TALKED OF.

AND FANNY, WHAT WAS SHE DOING AND THINKING ALL THIS WHILE? AND WHAT
WAS HER OPINION OF THE NEWCOMERS? FEW YOUNG LADIES OF EIGHTEEN COULD
BE LESS CALLED ON TO SPEAK THEIR OPINION THAN FANNY. IN A QUIET WAY,
VERY LITTLE ATTENDED TO, SHE PAID HER TRIBUTE OF ADMIRATION TO MISS
CRAWFORD'S BEAUTY; BUT AS SHE STILL CONTINUED TO THINK MR. CRAWFORD
VERY PLAIN, IN SPITE OF HER TWO COUSINS HAVING REPEATEDLY PROVED THE
CONTRARY, SHE NEVER MENTIONED HIM. THE NOTICE, WHICH SHE EXCITED
HERSELF, WAS TO THIS EFFECT. "I BEGIN NOW TO UNDERSTAND YOU ALL,
EXCEPT MISS PRICE," SAID MISS CRAWFORD, AS SHE WAS WALKING WITH THE MR.
BERTRAMS. "PRAY, IS SHE OUT, OR IS SHE NOT? I AM PUZZLED. SHE DINED AT
THE PARSONAGE, WITH THE REST OF YOU, WHICH SEEMED LIKE BEING OUT; AND
YET SHE SAYS SO LITTLE, THAT I CAN HARDLY SUPPOSE SHE IS."

EDMUND, TO WHOM THIS WAS CHIEFLY ADDRESSED, REPLIED, "I BELIEVE I KNOW
WHAT YOU MEAN, BUT I WILL NOT UNDERTAKE TO ANSWER THE QUESTION. MY
COUSIN IS GROWN UP. SHE HAS THE AGE AND SENSE OF A WOMAN, BUT THE OUTS
AND NOT OUTS ARE BEYOND ME."

"AND YET, IN GENERAL, NOTHING CAN BE MORE EASILY ASCERTAINED. THE
DISTINCTION IS SO BROAD. MANNERS AS WELL AS APPEARANCE ARE, GENERALLY
SPEAKING, SO TOTALLY DIFFERENT. TILL NOW, I COULD NOT HAVE SUPPOSED IT
POSSIBLE TO BE MISTAKEN AS TO A GIRL'S BEING OUT OR NOT. A GIRL NOT OUT
HAS ALWAYS THE SAME SORT OF DRESS: A CLOSE BONNET, FOR INSTANCE; LOOKS
VERY DEMURE, AND NEVER SAYS A WORD. YOU MAY SMILE, BUT IT IS SO, I
ASSURE YOU; AND EXCEPT THAT IT IS SOMETIMES CARRIED A LITTLE TOO FAR,
IT IS ALL VERY PROPER. GIRLS SHOULD BE QUIET AND MODEST. THE MOST
OBJECTIONABLE PART IS, THAT THE ALTERATION OF MANNERS ON BEING
INTRODUCED INTO COMPANY IS FREQUENTLY TOO SUDDEN. THEY SOMETIMES PASS IN
SUCH VERY LITTLE TIME FROM RESERVE TO QUITE THE OPPOSITE--TO CONFIDENCE!
THAT IS THE FAULTY PART OF THE PRESENT SYSTEM. ONE DOES NOT LIKE TO
SEE A GIRL OF EIGHTEEN OR NINETEEN SO IMMEDIATELY UP TO EVERY THING--AND
PERHAPS WHEN ONE HAS SEEN HER HARDLY ABLE TO SPEAK THE YEAR BEFORE. MR.
BERTRAM, I DARE SAY YOU HAVE SOMETIMES MET WITH SUCH CHANGES."

"I BELIEVE I HAVE, BUT THIS IS HARDLY FAIR; I SEE WHAT YOU ARE AT. YOU
ARE QUIZZING ME AND MISS ANDERSON."

"NO, INDEED. MISS ANDERSON! I DO NOT KNOW WHO OR WHAT YOU MEAN. I AM
QUITE IN THE DARK. BUT I WILL QUIZ YOU WITH A GREAT DEAL OF PLEASURE,
IF YOU WILL TELL ME WHAT ABOUT."

"AH! YOU CARRY IT OFF VERY WELL, BUT I CANNOT BE QUITE SO FAR IMPOSED
ON. YOU MUST HAVE HAD MISS ANDERSON IN YOUR EYE, IN DESCRIBING AN
ALTERED YOUNG LADY. YOU PAINT TOO ACCURATELY FOR MISTAKE. IT WAS EXACTLY
SO. THE ANDERSONS OF BAKER STREET. WE WERE SPEAKING OF THEM THE OTHER
DAY, YOU KNOW. EDMUND, YOU HAVE HEARD ME MENTION CHARLES ANDERSON.
THE CIRCUMSTANCE WAS PRECISELY AS THIS LADY HAS REPRESENTED IT. WHEN
ANDERSON FIRST INTRODUCED ME TO HIS FAMILY, ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO, HIS
SISTER WAS NOT OUT, AND I COULD NOT GET HER TO SPEAK TO ME. I SAT
THERE AN HOUR ONE MORNING WAITING FOR ANDERSON, WITH ONLY HER AND A
LITTLE GIRL OR TWO IN THE ROOM, THE GOVERNESS BEING SICK OR RUN AWAY,
AND THE MOTHER IN AND OUT EVERY MOMENT WITH LETTERS OF BUSINESS, AND I
COULD HARDLY GET A WORD OR A LOOK FROM THE YOUNG LADY--NOTHING LIKE A
CIVIL ANSWER--SHE SCREWED UP HER MOUTH, AND TURNED FROM ME WITH SUCH AN
AIR! I DID NOT SEE HER AGAIN FOR A TWELVEMONTH. SHE WAS THEN OUT. I
MET HER AT MRS. HOLFORD'S, AND DID NOT RECOLLECT HER. SHE CAME UP TO ME,
CLAIMED ME AS AN ACQUAINTANCE, STARED ME OUT OF COUNTENANCE; AND TALKED
AND LAUGHED TILL I DID NOT KNOW WHICH WAY TO LOOK. I FELT THAT I MUST
BE THE JEST OF THE ROOM AT THE TIME, AND MISS CRAWFORD, IT IS PLAIN, HAS
HEARD THE STORY."

"AND A VERY PRETTY STORY IT IS, AND WITH MORE TRUTH IN IT, I DARE SAY,
THAN DOES CREDIT TO MISS ANDERSON. IT IS TOO COMMON A FAULT. MOTHERS
CERTAINLY HAVE NOT YET GOT QUITE THE RIGHT WAY OF MANAGING THEIR
DAUGHTERS. I DO NOT KNOW WHERE THE ERROR LIES. I DO NOT PRETEND TO SET
PEOPLE RIGHT, BUT I DO SEE THAT THEY ARE OFTEN WRONG."

"THOSE WHO ARE SHOWING THE WORLD WHAT FEMALE MANNERS SHOULD BE," SAID
MR. BERTRAM GALLANTLY, "ARE DOING A GREAT DEAL TO SET THEM RIGHT."

"THE ERROR IS PLAIN ENOUGH," SAID THE LESS COURTEOUS EDMUND; "SUCH GIRLS
ARE ILL BROUGHT UP. THEY ARE GIVEN WRONG NOTIONS FROM THE BEGINNING.
THEY ARE ALWAYS ACTING UPON MOTIVES OF VANITY, AND THERE IS NO MORE
REAL MODESTY IN THEIR BEHAVIOUR BEFORE THEY APPEAR IN PUBLIC THAN
AFTERWARDS."

"I DO NOT KNOW," REPLIED MISS CRAWFORD HESITATINGLY. "YES, I CANNOT
AGREE WITH YOU THERE. IT IS CERTAINLY THE MODESTEST PART OF THE
BUSINESS. IT IS MUCH WORSE TO HAVE GIRLS NOT OUT GIVE THEMSELVES THE
SAME AIRS AND TAKE THE SAME LIBERTIES AS IF THEY WERE, WHICH I HAVE SEEN
DONE. THAT IS WORSE THAN ANYTHING--QUITE DISGUSTING!"

"YES, THAT IS VERY INCONVENIENT INDEED," SAID MR. BERTRAM. "IT LEADS
ONE ASTRAY; ONE DOES NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO. THE CLOSE BONNET AND DEMURE
AIR YOU DESCRIBE SO WELL (AND NOTHING WAS EVER JUSTER), TELL ONE WHAT
IS EXPECTED; BUT I GOT INTO A DREADFUL SCRAPE LAST YEAR FROM THE WANT OF
THEM. I WENT DOWN TO RAMSGATE FOR A WEEK WITH A FRIEND LAST SEPTEMBER,
JUST AFTER MY RETURN FROM THE WEST INDIES. MY FRIEND SNEYD--YOU HAVE
HEARD ME SPEAK OF SNEYD, EDMUND--HIS FATHER, AND MOTHER, AND SISTERS,
WERE THERE, ALL NEW TO ME. WHEN WE REACHED ALBION PLACE THEY WERE OUT;
WE WENT AFTER THEM, AND FOUND THEM ON THE PIER: MRS. AND THE TWO MISS
SNEYDS, WITH OTHERS OF THEIR ACQUAINTANCE. I MADE MY BOW IN FORM; AND
AS MRS. SNEYD WAS SURROUNDED BY MEN, ATTACHED MYSELF TO ONE OF HER
DAUGHTERS, WALKED BY HER SIDE ALL THE WAY HOME, AND MADE MYSELF AS
AGREEABLE AS I COULD; THE YOUNG LADY PERFECTLY EASY IN HER MANNERS, AND
AS READY TO TALK AS TO LISTEN. I HAD NOT A SUSPICION THAT I COULD BE
DOING ANYTHING WRONG. THEY LOOKED JUST THE SAME: BOTH WELL-DRESSED, WITH
VEILS AND PARASOLS LIKE OTHER GIRLS; BUT I AFTERWARDS FOUND THAT I HAD
BEEN GIVING ALL MY ATTENTION TO THE YOUNGEST, WHO WAS NOT OUT, AND
HAD MOST EXCESSIVELY OFFENDED THE ELDEST. MISS AUGUSTA OUGHT NOT TO HAVE
BEEN NOTICED FOR THE NEXT SIX MONTHS; AND MISS SNEYD, I BELIEVE, HAS
NEVER FORGIVEN ME."

"THAT WAS BAD INDEED. POOR MISS SNEYD. THOUGH I HAVE NO YOUNGER
SISTER, I FEEL FOR HER. TO BE NEGLECTED BEFORE ONE'S TIME MUST BE VERY
VEXATIOUS; BUT IT WAS ENTIRELY THE MOTHER'S FAULT. MISS AUGUSTA SHOULD
HAVE BEEN WITH HER GOVERNESS. SUCH HALF-AND-HALF DOINGS NEVER PROSPER.
BUT NOW I MUST BE SATISFIED ABOUT MISS PRICE. DOES SHE GO TO BALLS? DOES
SHE DINE OUT EVERY WHERE, AS WELL AS AT MY SISTER'S?"

"NO," REPLIED EDMUND; "I DO NOT THINK SHE HAS EVER BEEN TO A BALL. MY
MOTHER SELDOM GOES INTO COMPANY HERSELF, AND DINES NOWHERE BUT WITH MRS.
GRANT, AND FANNY STAYS AT HOME WITH HER."

"OH! THEN THE POINT IS CLEAR. MISS PRICE IS NOT OUT."



CHAPTER VI

MR. BERTRAM SET OFF FOR--------, AND MISS CRAWFORD WAS PREPARED TO
FIND A GREAT CHASM IN THEIR SOCIETY, AND TO MISS HIM DECIDEDLY IN THE
MEETINGS WHICH WERE NOW BECOMING ALMOST DAILY BETWEEN THE FAMILIES;
AND ON THEIR ALL DINING TOGETHER AT THE PARK SOON AFTER HIS GOING, SHE
RETOOK HER CHOSEN PLACE NEAR THE BOTTOM OF THE TABLE, FULLY EXPECTING TO
FEEL A MOST MELANCHOLY DIFFERENCE IN THE CHANGE OF MASTERS. IT WOULD
BE A VERY FLAT BUSINESS, SHE WAS SURE. IN COMPARISON WITH HIS BROTHER,
EDMUND WOULD HAVE NOTHING TO SAY. THE SOUP WOULD BE SENT ROUND IN A MOST
SPIRITLESS MANNER, WINE DRANK WITHOUT ANY SMILES OR AGREEABLE TRIFLING,
AND THE VENISON CUT UP WITHOUT SUPPLYING ONE PLEASANT ANECDOTE OF ANY
FORMER HAUNCH, OR A SINGLE ENTERTAINING STORY, ABOUT "MY FRIEND SUCH A
ONE." SHE MUST TRY TO FIND AMUSEMENT IN WHAT WAS PASSING AT THE UPPER
END OF THE TABLE, AND IN OBSERVING MR. RUSHWORTH, WHO WAS NOW MAKING HIS
APPEARANCE AT MANSFIELD FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE CRAWFORDS' ARRIVAL.
HE HAD BEEN VISITING A FRIEND IN THE NEIGHBOURING COUNTY, AND THAT
FRIEND HAVING RECENTLY HAD HIS GROUNDS LAID OUT BY AN IMPROVER, MR.
RUSHWORTH WAS RETURNED WITH HIS HEAD FULL OF THE SUBJECT, AND VERY EAGER
TO BE IMPROVING HIS OWN PLACE IN THE SAME WAY; AND THOUGH NOT SAYING
MUCH TO THE PURPOSE, COULD TALK OF NOTHING ELSE. THE SUBJECT HAD
BEEN ALREADY HANDLED IN THE DRAWING-ROOM; IT WAS REVIVED IN THE
DINING-PARLOUR. MISS BERTRAM'S ATTENTION AND OPINION WAS EVIDENTLY HIS
CHIEF AIM; AND THOUGH HER DEPORTMENT SHOWED RATHER CONSCIOUS SUPERIORITY
THAN ANY SOLICITUDE TO OBLIGE HIM, THE MENTION OF SOTHERTON COURT,
AND THE IDEAS ATTACHED TO IT, GAVE HER A FEELING OF COMPLACENCY, WHICH
PREVENTED HER FROM BEING VERY UNGRACIOUS.

"I WISH YOU COULD SEE COMPTON," SAID HE; "IT IS THE MOST COMPLETE THING!
I NEVER SAW A PLACE SO ALTERED IN MY LIFE. I TOLD SMITH I DID NOT KNOW
WHERE I WAS. THE APPROACH NOW, IS ONE OF THE FINEST THINGS IN THE
COUNTRY: YOU SEE THE HOUSE IN THE MOST SURPRISING MANNER. I DECLARE,
WHEN I GOT BACK TO SOTHERTON YESTERDAY, IT LOOKED LIKE A PRISON--QUITE A
DISMAL OLD PRISON."

"OH, FOR SHAME!" CRIED MRS. NORRIS. "A PRISON INDEED? SOTHERTON COURT IS
THE NOBLEST OLD PLACE IN THE WORLD."

"IT WANTS IMPROVEMENT, MA'AM, BEYOND ANYTHING. I NEVER SAW A PLACE THAT
WANTED SO MUCH IMPROVEMENT IN MY LIFE; AND IT IS SO FORLORN THAT I DO
NOT KNOW WHAT CAN BE DONE WITH IT."

"NO WONDER THAT MR. RUSHWORTH SHOULD THINK SO AT PRESENT," SAID MRS.
GRANT TO MRS. NORRIS, WITH A SMILE; "BUT DEPEND UPON IT, SOTHERTON WILL
HAVE EVERY IMPROVEMENT IN TIME WHICH HIS HEART CAN DESIRE."

"I MUST TRY TO DO SOMETHING WITH IT," SAID MR. RUSHWORTH, "BUT I DO NOT
KNOW WHAT. I HOPE I SHALL HAVE SOME GOOD FRIEND TO HELP ME."

"YOUR BEST FRIEND UPON SUCH AN OCCASION," SAID MISS BERTRAM CALMLY,
"WOULD BE MR. REPTON, I IMAGINE."

"THAT IS WHAT I WAS THINKING OF. AS HE HAS DONE SO WELL BY SMITH, I
THINK I HAD BETTER HAVE HIM AT ONCE. HIS TERMS ARE FIVE GUINEAS A DAY."

"WELL, AND IF THEY WERE TEN," CRIED MRS. NORRIS, "I AM SURE YOU NEED
NOT REGARD IT. THE EXPENSE NEED NOT BE ANY IMPEDIMENT. IF I WERE YOU,
I SHOULD NOT THINK OF THE EXPENSE. I WOULD HAVE EVERYTHING DONE IN THE
BEST STYLE, AND MADE AS NICE AS POSSIBLE. SUCH A PLACE AS SOTHERTON
COURT DESERVES EVERYTHING THAT TASTE AND MONEY CAN DO. YOU HAVE SPACE TO
WORK UPON THERE, AND GROUNDS THAT WILL WELL REWARD YOU. FOR MY OWN PART,
IF I HAD ANYTHING WITHIN THE FIFTIETH PART OF THE SIZE OF SOTHERTON, I
SHOULD BE ALWAYS PLANTING AND IMPROVING, FOR NATURALLY I AM EXCESSIVELY
FOND OF IT. IT WOULD BE TOO RIDICULOUS FOR ME TO ATTEMPT ANYTHING WHERE
I AM NOW, WITH MY LITTLE HALF ACRE. IT WOULD BE QUITE A BURLESQUE. BUT
IF I HAD MORE ROOM, I SHOULD TAKE A PRODIGIOUS DELIGHT IN IMPROVING AND
PLANTING. WE DID A VAST DEAL IN THAT WAY AT THE PARSONAGE: WE MADE IT
QUITE A DIFFERENT PLACE FROM WHAT IT WAS WHEN WE FIRST HAD IT. YOU YOUNG
ONES DO NOT REMEMBER MUCH ABOUT IT, PERHAPS; BUT IF DEAR SIR THOMAS WERE
HERE, HE COULD TELL YOU WHAT IMPROVEMENTS WE MADE: AND A GREAT DEAL MORE
WOULD HAVE BEEN DONE, BUT FOR POOR MR. NORRIS'S SAD STATE OF HEALTH.
HE COULD HARDLY EVER GET OUT, POOR MAN, TO ENJOY ANYTHING, AND THAT
DISHEARTENED ME FROM DOING SEVERAL THINGS THAT SIR THOMAS AND I USED TO
TALK OF. IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR THAT, WE SHOULD HAVE CARRIED ON THE
GARDEN WALL, AND MADE THE PLANTATION TO SHUT OUT THE CHURCHYARD, JUST
AS DR. GRANT HAS DONE. WE WERE ALWAYS DOING SOMETHING AS IT WAS. IT WAS
ONLY THE SPRING TWELVEMONTH BEFORE MR. NORRIS'S DEATH THAT WE PUT IN THE
APRICOT AGAINST THE STABLE WALL, WHICH IS NOW GROWN SUCH A NOBLE TREE,
AND GETTING TO SUCH PERFECTION, SIR," ADDRESSING HERSELF THEN TO DR.
GRANT.

"THE TREE THRIVES WELL, BEYOND A DOUBT, MADAM," REPLIED DR. GRANT. "THE
SOIL IS GOOD; AND I NEVER PASS IT WITHOUT REGRETTING THAT THE FRUIT
SHOULD BE SO LITTLE WORTH THE TROUBLE OF GATHERING."

"SIR, IT IS A MOOR PARK, WE BOUGHT IT AS A MOOR PARK, AND IT COST
US--THAT IS, IT WAS A PRESENT FROM SIR THOMAS, BUT I SAW THE BILL--AND I
KNOW IT COST SEVEN SHILLINGS, AND WAS CHARGED AS A MOOR PARK."

"YOU WERE IMPOSED ON, MA'AM," REPLIED DR. GRANT: "THESE POTATOES HAVE AS
MUCH THE FLAVOUR OF A MOOR PARK APRICOT AS THE FRUIT FROM THAT TREE. IT
IS AN INSIPID FRUIT AT THE BEST; BUT A GOOD APRICOT IS EATABLE, WHICH
NONE FROM MY GARDEN ARE."

"THE TRUTH IS, MA'AM," SAID MRS. GRANT, PRETENDING TO WHISPER ACROSS
THE TABLE TO MRS. NORRIS, "THAT DR. GRANT HARDLY KNOWS WHAT THE NATURAL
TASTE OF OUR APRICOT IS: HE IS SCARCELY EVER INDULGED WITH ONE, FOR IT
IS SO VALUABLE A FRUIT; WITH A LITTLE ASSISTANCE, AND OURS IS SUCH A
REMARKABLY LARGE, FAIR SORT, THAT WHAT WITH EARLY TARTS AND PRESERVES,
MY COOK CONTRIVES TO GET THEM ALL."

MRS. NORRIS, WHO HAD BEGUN TO REDDEN, WAS APPEASED; AND, FOR A LITTLE
WHILE, OTHER SUBJECTS TOOK PLACE OF THE IMPROVEMENTS OF SOTHERTON. DR.
GRANT AND MRS. NORRIS WERE SELDOM GOOD FRIENDS; THEIR ACQUAINTANCE HAD
BEGUN IN DILAPIDATIONS, AND THEIR HABITS WERE TOTALLY DISSIMILAR.

AFTER A SHORT INTERRUPTION MR. RUSHWORTH BEGAN AGAIN. "SMITH'S PLACE
IS THE ADMIRATION OF ALL THE COUNTRY; AND IT WAS A MERE NOTHING BEFORE
REPTON TOOK IT IN HAND. I THINK I SHALL HAVE REPTON."

"MR. RUSHWORTH," SAID LADY BERTRAM, "IF I WERE YOU, I WOULD HAVE A
VERY PRETTY SHRUBBERY. ONE LIKES TO GET OUT INTO A SHRUBBERY IN FINE
WEATHER."

MR. RUSHWORTH WAS EAGER TO ASSURE HER LADYSHIP OF HIS ACQUIESCENCE, AND
TRIED TO MAKE OUT SOMETHING COMPLIMENTARY; BUT, BETWEEN HIS SUBMISSION
TO HER TASTE, AND HIS HAVING ALWAYS INTENDED THE SAME HIMSELF, WITH
THE SUPERADDED OBJECTS OF PROFESSING ATTENTION TO THE COMFORT OF LADIES
IN GENERAL, AND OF INSINUATING THAT THERE WAS ONE ONLY WHOM HE WAS
ANXIOUS TO PLEASE, HE GREW PUZZLED, AND EDMUND WAS GLAD TO PUT AN END
TO HIS SPEECH BY A PROPOSAL OF WINE. MR. RUSHWORTH, HOWEVER, THOUGH NOT
USUALLY A GREAT TALKER, HAD STILL MORE TO SAY ON THE SUBJECT NEXT HIS
HEART. "SMITH HAS NOT MUCH ABOVE A HUNDRED ACRES ALTOGETHER IN HIS
GROUNDS, WHICH IS LITTLE ENOUGH, AND MAKES IT MORE SURPRISING THAT THE
PLACE CAN HAVE BEEN SO IMPROVED. NOW, AT SOTHERTON WE HAVE A GOOD SEVEN
HUNDRED, WITHOUT RECKONING THE WATER MEADOWS; SO THAT I THINK, IF SO
MUCH COULD BE DONE AT COMPTON, WE NEED NOT DESPAIR. THERE HAVE BEEN TWO
OR THREE FINE OLD TREES CUT DOWN, THAT GREW TOO NEAR THE HOUSE, AND
IT OPENS THE PROSPECT AMAZINGLY, WHICH MAKES ME THINK THAT REPTON, OR
ANYBODY OF THAT SORT, WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE THE AVENUE AT SOTHERTON DOWN:
THE AVENUE THAT LEADS FROM THE WEST FRONT TO THE TOP OF THE HILL,
YOU KNOW," TURNING TO MISS BERTRAM PARTICULARLY AS HE SPOKE. BUT MISS
BERTRAM THOUGHT IT MOST BECOMING TO REPLY--

"THE AVENUE! OH! I DO NOT RECOLLECT IT. I REALLY KNOW VERY LITTLE OF
SOTHERTON."

FANNY, WHO WAS SITTING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF EDMUND, EXACTLY OPPOSITE
MISS CRAWFORD, AND WHO HAD BEEN ATTENTIVELY LISTENING, NOW LOOKED AT
HIM, AND SAID IN A LOW VOICE--

"CUT DOWN AN AVENUE! WHAT A PITY! DOES IT NOT MAKE YOU THINK OF COWPER?
'YE FALLEN AVENUES, ONCE MORE I MOURN YOUR FATE UNMERITED.'"

HE SMILED AS HE ANSWERED, "I AM AFRAID THE AVENUE STANDS A BAD CHANCE,
FANNY."

"I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE SOTHERTON BEFORE IT IS CUT DOWN, TO SEE THE PLACE
AS IT IS NOW, IN ITS OLD STATE; BUT I DO NOT SUPPOSE I SHALL."

"HAVE YOU NEVER BEEN THERE? NO, YOU NEVER CAN; AND, UNLUCKILY, IT IS OUT
OF DISTANCE FOR A RIDE. I WISH WE COULD CONTRIVE IT."

"OH! IT DOES NOT SIGNIFY. WHENEVER I DO SEE IT, YOU WILL TELL ME HOW IT
HAS BEEN ALTERED."

"I COLLECT," SAID MISS CRAWFORD, "THAT SOTHERTON IS AN OLD PLACE, AND A
PLACE OF SOME GRANDEUR. IN ANY PARTICULAR STYLE OF BUILDING?"

"THE HOUSE WAS BUILT IN ELIZABETH'S TIME, AND IS A LARGE, REGULAR, BRICK
BUILDING; HEAVY, BUT RESPECTABLE LOOKING, AND HAS MANY GOOD ROOMS. IT
IS ILL PLACED. IT STANDS IN ONE OF THE LOWEST SPOTS OF THE PARK; IN THAT
RESPECT, UNFAVOURABLE FOR IMPROVEMENT. BUT THE WOODS ARE FINE, AND
THERE IS A STREAM, WHICH, I DARE SAY, MIGHT BE MADE A GOOD DEAL OF. MR.
RUSHWORTH IS QUITE RIGHT, I THINK, IN MEANING TO GIVE IT A MODERN DRESS,
AND I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT IT WILL BE ALL DONE EXTREMELY WELL."

MISS CRAWFORD LISTENED WITH SUBMISSION, AND SAID TO HERSELF, "HE IS A
WELL-BRED MAN; HE MAKES THE BEST OF IT."

"I DO NOT WISH TO INFLUENCE MR. RUSHWORTH," HE CONTINUED; "BUT, HAD I
A PLACE TO NEW FASHION, I SHOULD NOT PUT MYSELF INTO THE HANDS OF AN
IMPROVER. I WOULD RATHER HAVE AN INFERIOR DEGREE OF BEAUTY, OF MY OWN
CHOICE, AND ACQUIRED PROGRESSIVELY. I WOULD RATHER ABIDE BY MY OWN
BLUNDERS THAN BY HIS."

"YOU WOULD KNOW WHAT YOU WERE ABOUT, OF COURSE; BUT THAT WOULD NOT
SUIT ME. I HAVE NO EYE OR INGENUITY FOR SUCH MATTERS, BUT AS THEY ARE
BEFORE ME; AND HAD I A PLACE OF MY OWN IN THE COUNTRY, I SHOULD BE MOST
THANKFUL TO ANY MR. REPTON WHO WOULD UNDERTAKE IT, AND GIVE ME AS MUCH
BEAUTY AS HE COULD FOR MY MONEY; AND I SHOULD NEVER LOOK AT IT TILL IT
WAS COMPLETE."

"IT WOULD BE DELIGHTFUL TO ME TO SEE THE PROGRESS OF IT ALL," SAID
FANNY.

"AY, YOU HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP TO IT. IT WAS NO PART OF MY EDUCATION; AND
THE ONLY DOSE I EVER HAD, BEING ADMINISTERED BY NOT THE FIRST FAVOURITE
IN THE WORLD, HAS MADE ME CONSIDER IMPROVEMENTS IN HAND AS THE
GREATEST OF NUISANCES. THREE YEARS AGO THE ADMIRAL, MY HONOURED UNCLE,
BOUGHT A COTTAGE AT TWICKENHAM FOR US ALL TO SPEND OUR SUMMERS IN;
AND MY AUNT AND I WENT DOWN TO IT QUITE IN RAPTURES; BUT IT BEING
EXCESSIVELY PRETTY, IT WAS SOON FOUND NECESSARY TO BE IMPROVED, AND FOR
THREE MONTHS WE WERE ALL DIRT AND CONFUSION, WITHOUT A GRAVEL WALK TO
STEP ON, OR A BENCH FIT FOR USE. I WOULD HAVE EVERYTHING AS COMPLETE
AS POSSIBLE IN THE COUNTRY, SHRUBBERIES AND FLOWER-GARDENS, AND RUSTIC
SEATS INNUMERABLE: BUT IT MUST ALL BE DONE WITHOUT MY CARE. HENRY IS
DIFFERENT; HE LOVES TO BE DOING."

EDMUND WAS SORRY TO HEAR MISS CRAWFORD, WHOM HE WAS MUCH DISPOSED TO
ADMIRE, SPEAK SO FREELY OF HER UNCLE. IT DID NOT SUIT HIS SENSE OF
PROPRIETY, AND HE WAS SILENCED, TILL INDUCED BY FURTHER SMILES AND
LIVELINESS TO PUT THE MATTER BY FOR THE PRESENT.

"MR. BERTRAM," SAID SHE, "I HAVE TIDINGS OF MY HARP AT LAST. I AM
ASSURED THAT IT IS SAFE AT NORTHAMPTON; AND THERE IT HAS PROBABLY BEEN
THESE TEN DAYS, IN SPITE OF THE SOLEMN ASSURANCES WE HAVE SO OFTEN
RECEIVED TO THE CONTRARY." EDMUND EXPRESSED HIS PLEASURE AND SURPRISE.
"THE TRUTH IS, THAT OUR INQUIRIES WERE TOO DIRECT; WE SENT A SERVANT,
WE WENT OURSELVES: THIS WILL NOT DO SEVENTY MILES FROM LONDON; BUT THIS
MORNING WE HEARD OF IT IN THE RIGHT WAY. IT WAS SEEN BY SOME FARMER, AND
HE TOLD THE MILLER, AND THE MILLER TOLD THE BUTCHER, AND THE BUTCHER'S
SON-IN-LAW LEFT WORD AT THE SHOP."

"I AM VERY GLAD THAT YOU HAVE HEARD OF IT, BY WHATEVER MEANS, AND HOPE
THERE WILL BE NO FURTHER DELAY."

"I AM TO HAVE IT TO-MORROW; BUT HOW DO YOU THINK IT IS TO BE CONVEYED?
NOT BY A WAGON OR CART: OH NO! NOTHING OF THAT KIND COULD BE HIRED IN
THE VILLAGE. I MIGHT AS WELL HAVE ASKED FOR PORTERS AND A HANDBARROW."

"YOU WOULD FIND IT DIFFICULT, I DARE SAY, JUST NOW, IN THE MIDDLE OF A
VERY LATE HAY HARVEST, TO HIRE A HORSE AND CART?"

"I WAS ASTONISHED TO FIND WHAT A PIECE OF WORK WAS MADE OF IT! TO WANT
A HORSE AND CART IN THE COUNTRY SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE, SO I TOLD MY MAID TO
SPEAK FOR ONE DIRECTLY; AND AS I CANNOT LOOK OUT OF MY DRESSING-CLOSET
WITHOUT SEEING ONE FARMYARD, NOR WALK IN THE SHRUBBERY WITHOUT PASSING
ANOTHER, I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE ONLY ASK AND HAVE, AND WAS RATHER GRIEVED
THAT I COULD NOT GIVE THE ADVANTAGE TO ALL. GUESS MY SURPRISE, WHEN
I FOUND THAT I HAD BEEN ASKING THE MOST UNREASONABLE, MOST IMPOSSIBLE
THING IN THE WORLD; HAD OFFENDED ALL THE FARMERS, ALL THE LABOURERS,
ALL THE HAY IN THE PARISH! AS FOR DR. GRANT'S BAILIFF, I BELIEVE I HAD
BETTER KEEP OUT OF HIS WAY; AND MY BROTHER-IN-LAW HIMSELF, WHO IS ALL
KINDNESS IN GENERAL, LOOKED RATHER BLACK UPON ME WHEN HE FOUND WHAT I
HAD BEEN AT."

"YOU COULD NOT BE EXPECTED TO HAVE THOUGHT ON THE SUBJECT BEFORE; BUT
WHEN YOU DO THINK OF IT, YOU MUST SEE THE IMPORTANCE OF GETTING IN
THE GRASS. THE HIRE OF A CART AT ANY TIME MIGHT NOT BE SO EASY AS YOU
SUPPOSE: OUR FARMERS ARE NOT IN THE HABIT OF LETTING THEM OUT; BUT, IN
HARVEST, IT MUST BE QUITE OUT OF THEIR POWER TO SPARE A HORSE."

"I SHALL UNDERSTAND ALL YOUR WAYS IN TIME; BUT, COMING DOWN WITH THE
TRUE LONDON MAXIM, THAT EVERYTHING IS TO BE GOT WITH MONEY, I WAS A
LITTLE EMBARRASSED AT FIRST BY THE STURDY INDEPENDENCE OF YOUR COUNTRY
CUSTOMS. HOWEVER, I AM TO HAVE MY HARP FETCHED TO-MORROW. HENRY, WHO IS
GOOD-NATURE ITSELF, HAS OFFERED TO FETCH IT IN HIS BAROUCHE. WILL IT NOT
BE HONOURABLY CONVEYED?"

EDMUND SPOKE OF THE HARP AS HIS FAVOURITE INSTRUMENT, AND HOPED TO BE
SOON ALLOWED TO HEAR HER. FANNY HAD NEVER HEARD THE HARP AT ALL, AND
WISHED FOR IT VERY MUCH.

"I SHALL BE MOST HAPPY TO PLAY TO YOU BOTH," SAID MISS CRAWFORD; "AT
LEAST AS LONG AS YOU CAN LIKE TO LISTEN: PROBABLY MUCH LONGER, FOR
I DEARLY LOVE MUSIC MYSELF, AND WHERE THE NATURAL TASTE IS EQUAL THE
PLAYER MUST ALWAYS BE BEST OFF, FOR SHE IS GRATIFIED IN MORE WAYS THAN
ONE. NOW, MR. BERTRAM, IF YOU WRITE TO YOUR BROTHER, I ENTREAT YOU TO
TELL HIM THAT MY HARP IS COME: HE HEARD SO MUCH OF MY MISERY ABOUT IT.
AND YOU MAY SAY, IF YOU PLEASE, THAT I SHALL PREPARE MY MOST PLAINTIVE
AIRS AGAINST HIS RETURN, IN COMPASSION TO HIS FEELINGS, AS I KNOW HIS
HORSE WILL LOSE."

"IF I WRITE, I WILL SAY WHATEVER YOU WISH ME; BUT I DO NOT, AT PRESENT,
FORESEE ANY OCCASION FOR WRITING."

"NO, I DARE SAY, NOR IF HE WERE TO BE GONE A TWELVEMONTH, WOULD YOU EVER
WRITE TO HIM, NOR HE TO YOU, IF IT COULD BE HELPED. THE OCCASION WOULD
NEVER BE FORESEEN. WHAT STRANGE CREATURES BROTHERS ARE! YOU WOULD NOT
WRITE TO EACH OTHER BUT UPON THE MOST URGENT NECESSITY IN THE WORLD; AND
WHEN OBLIGED TO TAKE UP THE PEN TO SAY THAT SUCH A HORSE IS ILL, OR SUCH
A RELATION DEAD, IT IS DONE IN THE FEWEST POSSIBLE WORDS. YOU HAVE BUT
ONE STYLE AMONG YOU. I KNOW IT PERFECTLY. HENRY, WHO IS IN EVERY OTHER
RESPECT EXACTLY WHAT A BROTHER SHOULD BE, WHO LOVES ME, CONSULTS ME,
CONFIDES IN ME, AND WILL TALK TO ME BY THE HOUR TOGETHER, HAS NEVER
YET TURNED THE PAGE IN A LETTER; AND VERY OFTEN IT IS NOTHING MORE
THAN--'DEAR MARY, I AM JUST ARRIVED. BATH SEEMS FULL, AND EVERYTHING
AS USUAL. YOURS SINCERELY.' THAT IS THE TRUE MANLY STYLE; THAT IS A
COMPLETE BROTHER'S LETTER."

"WHEN THEY ARE AT A DISTANCE FROM ALL THEIR FAMILY," SAID FANNY,
COLOURING FOR WILLIAM'S SAKE, "THEY CAN WRITE LONG LETTERS."

"MISS PRICE HAS A BROTHER AT SEA," SAID EDMUND, "WHOSE EXCELLENCE AS A
CORRESPONDENT MAKES HER THINK YOU TOO SEVERE UPON US."

"AT SEA, HAS SHE? IN THE KING'S SERVICE, OF COURSE?"

FANNY WOULD RATHER HAVE HAD EDMUND TELL THE STORY, BUT HIS DETERMINED
SILENCE OBLIGED HER TO RELATE HER BROTHER'S SITUATION: HER VOICE WAS
ANIMATED IN SPEAKING OF HIS PROFESSION, AND THE FOREIGN STATIONS HE HAD
BEEN ON; BUT SHE COULD NOT MENTION THE NUMBER OF YEARS THAT HE HAD BEEN
ABSENT WITHOUT TEARS IN HER EYES. MISS CRAWFORD CIVILLY WISHED HIM AN
EARLY PROMOTION.

"DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING OF MY COUSIN'S CAPTAIN?" SAID EDMUND; "CAPTAIN
MARSHALL? YOU HAVE A LARGE ACQUAINTANCE IN THE NAVY, I CONCLUDE?"

"AMONG ADMIRALS, LARGE ENOUGH; BUT," WITH AN AIR OF GRANDEUR, "WE KNOW
VERY LITTLE OF THE INFERIOR RANKS. POST-CAPTAINS MAY BE VERY GOOD SORT
OF MEN, BUT THEY DO NOT BELONG TO US. OF VARIOUS ADMIRALS I COULD TELL
YOU A GREAT DEAL: OF THEM AND THEIR FLAGS, AND THE GRADATION OF THEIR
PAY, AND THEIR BICKERINGS AND JEALOUSIES. BUT, IN GENERAL, I CAN ASSURE
YOU THAT THEY ARE ALL PASSED OVER, AND ALL VERY ILL USED. CERTAINLY, MY
HOME AT MY UNCLE'S BROUGHT ME ACQUAINTED WITH A CIRCLE OF ADMIRALS. OF
REARS AND VICES I SAW ENOUGH. NOW DO NOT BE SUSPECTING ME OF A PUN,
I ENTREAT."

EDMUND AGAIN FELT GRAVE, AND ONLY REPLIED, "IT IS A NOBLE PROFESSION."

"YES, THE PROFESSION IS WELL ENOUGH UNDER TWO CIRCUMSTANCES: IF IT MAKE
THE FORTUNE, AND THERE BE DISCRETION IN SPENDING IT; BUT, IN SHORT, IT
IS NOT A FAVOURITE PROFESSION OF MINE. IT HAS NEVER WORN AN AMIABLE FORM
TO ME."

EDMUND REVERTED TO THE HARP, AND WAS AGAIN VERY HAPPY IN THE PROSPECT OF
HEARING HER PLAY.

THE SUBJECT OF IMPROVING GROUNDS, MEANWHILE, WAS STILL UNDER
CONSIDERATION AMONG THE OTHERS; AND MRS. GRANT COULD NOT HELP ADDRESSING
HER BROTHER, THOUGH IT WAS CALLING HIS ATTENTION FROM MISS JULIA
BERTRAM.

"MY DEAR HENRY, HAVE YOU NOTHING TO SAY? YOU HAVE BEEN AN IMPROVER
YOURSELF, AND FROM WHAT I HEAR OF EVERINGHAM, IT MAY VIE WITH ANY PLACE
IN ENGLAND. ITS NATURAL BEAUTIES, I AM SURE, ARE GREAT. EVERINGHAM,
AS IT USED TO BE, WAS PERFECT IN MY ESTIMATION: SUCH A HAPPY FALL OF
GROUND, AND SUCH TIMBER! WHAT WOULD I NOT GIVE TO SEE IT AGAIN?"

"NOTHING COULD BE SO GRATIFYING TO ME AS TO HEAR YOUR OPINION OF IT,"
WAS HIS ANSWER; "BUT I FEAR THERE WOULD BE SOME DISAPPOINTMENT: YOU
WOULD NOT FIND IT EQUAL TO YOUR PRESENT IDEAS. IN EXTENT, IT IS A MERE
NOTHING; YOU WOULD BE SURPRISED AT ITS INSIGNIFICANCE; AND, AS FOR
IMPROVEMENT, THERE WAS VERY LITTLE FOR ME TO DO--TOO LITTLE: I SHOULD
LIKE TO HAVE BEEN BUSY MUCH LONGER."

"YOU ARE FOND OF THE SORT OF THING?" SAID JULIA.

"EXCESSIVELY; BUT WHAT WITH THE NATURAL ADVANTAGES OF THE GROUND, WHICH
POINTED OUT, EVEN TO A VERY YOUNG EYE, WHAT LITTLE REMAINED TO BE DONE,
AND MY OWN CONSEQUENT RESOLUTIONS, I HAD NOT BEEN OF AGE THREE
MONTHS BEFORE EVERINGHAM WAS ALL THAT IT IS NOW. MY PLAN WAS LAID
AT WESTMINSTER, A LITTLE ALTERED, PERHAPS, AT CAMBRIDGE, AND AT
ONE-AND-TWENTY EXECUTED. I AM INCLINED TO ENVY MR. RUSHWORTH FOR HAVING
SO MUCH HAPPINESS YET BEFORE HIM. I HAVE BEEN A DEVOURER OF MY OWN."

"THOSE WHO SEE QUICKLY, WILL RESOLVE QUICKLY, AND ACT QUICKLY,"
SAID JULIA. "YOU CAN NEVER WANT EMPLOYMENT. INSTEAD OF ENVYING MR.
RUSHWORTH, YOU SHOULD ASSIST HIM WITH YOUR OPINION."

MRS. GRANT, HEARING THE LATTER PART OF THIS SPEECH, ENFORCED IT WARMLY,
PERSUADED THAT NO JUDGMENT COULD BE EQUAL TO HER BROTHER'S; AND AS
MISS BERTRAM CAUGHT AT THE IDEA LIKEWISE, AND GAVE IT HER FULL SUPPORT,
DECLARING THAT, IN HER OPINION, IT WAS INFINITELY BETTER TO CONSULT
WITH FRIENDS AND DISINTERESTED ADVISERS, THAN IMMEDIATELY TO THROW THE
BUSINESS INTO THE HANDS OF A PROFESSIONAL MAN, MR. RUSHWORTH WAS VERY
READY TO REQUEST THE FAVOUR OF MR. CRAWFORD'S ASSISTANCE; AND MR.
CRAWFORD, AFTER PROPERLY DEPRECIATING HIS OWN ABILITIES, WAS QUITE AT
HIS SERVICE IN ANY WAY THAT COULD BE USEFUL. MR. RUSHWORTH THEN BEGAN TO
PROPOSE MR. CRAWFORD'S DOING HIM THE HONOUR OF COMING OVER TO SOTHERTON,
AND TAKING A BED THERE; WHEN MRS. NORRIS, AS IF READING IN HER TWO
NIECES' MINDS THEIR LITTLE APPROBATION OF A PLAN WHICH WAS TO TAKE MR.
CRAWFORD AWAY, INTERPOSED WITH AN AMENDMENT.

"THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT OF MR. CRAWFORD'S WILLINGNESS; BUT WHY SHOULD NOT
MORE OF US GO? WHY SHOULD NOT WE MAKE A LITTLE PARTY? HERE ARE MANY THAT
WOULD BE INTERESTED IN YOUR IMPROVEMENTS, MY DEAR MR. RUSHWORTH, AND
THAT WOULD LIKE TO HEAR MR. CRAWFORD'S OPINION ON THE SPOT, AND THAT
MIGHT BE OF SOME SMALL USE TO YOU WITH THEIR OPINIONS; AND, FOR MY
OWN PART, I HAVE BEEN LONG WISHING TO WAIT UPON YOUR GOOD MOTHER AGAIN;
NOTHING BUT HAVING NO HORSES OF MY OWN COULD HAVE MADE ME SO REMISS; BUT
NOW I COULD GO AND SIT A FEW HOURS WITH MRS. RUSHWORTH, WHILE THE REST
OF YOU WALKED ABOUT AND SETTLED THINGS, AND THEN WE COULD ALL RETURN
TO A LATE DINNER HERE, OR DINE AT SOTHERTON, JUST AS MIGHT BE MOST
AGREEABLE TO YOUR MOTHER, AND HAVE A PLEASANT DRIVE HOME BY MOONLIGHT.
I DARE SAY MR. CRAWFORD WOULD TAKE MY TWO NIECES AND ME IN HIS BAROUCHE,
AND EDMUND CAN GO ON HORSEBACK, YOU KNOW, SISTER, AND FANNY WILL STAY AT
HOME WITH YOU."

LADY BERTRAM MADE NO OBJECTION; AND EVERY ONE CONCERNED IN THE GOING
WAS FORWARD IN EXPRESSING THEIR READY CONCURRENCE, EXCEPTING EDMUND, WHO
HEARD IT ALL AND SAID NOTHING.



CHAPTER VII

"WELL, FANNY, AND HOW DO YOU LIKE MISS CRAWFORD NOW?" SAID EDMUND THE
NEXT DAY, AFTER THINKING SOME TIME ON THE SUBJECT HIMSELF. "HOW DID YOU
LIKE HER YESTERDAY?"

"VERY WELL--VERY MUCH. I LIKE TO HEAR HER TALK. SHE ENTERTAINS ME; AND
SHE IS SO EXTREMELY PRETTY, THAT I HAVE GREAT PLEASURE IN LOOKING AT
HER."

"IT IS HER COUNTENANCE THAT IS SO ATTRACTIVE. SHE HAS A WONDERFUL PLAY
OF FEATURE! BUT WAS THERE NOTHING IN HER CONVERSATION THAT STRUCK YOU,
FANNY, AS NOT QUITE RIGHT?"

"OH YES! SHE OUGHT NOT TO HAVE SPOKEN OF HER UNCLE AS SHE DID. I WAS
QUITE ASTONISHED. AN UNCLE WITH WHOM SHE HAS BEEN LIVING SO MANY YEARS,
AND WHO, WHATEVER HIS FAULTS MAY BE, IS SO VERY FOND OF HER BROTHER,
TREATING HIM, THEY SAY, QUITE LIKE A SON. I COULD NOT HAVE BELIEVED IT!"

"I THOUGHT YOU WOULD BE STRUCK. IT WAS VERY WRONG; VERY INDECOROUS."

"AND VERY UNGRATEFUL, I THINK."

"UNGRATEFUL IS A STRONG WORD. I DO NOT KNOW THAT HER UNCLE HAS ANY CLAIM
TO HER GRATITUDE; HIS WIFE CERTAINLY HAD; AND IT IS THE WARMTH OF HER
RESPECT FOR HER AUNT'S MEMORY WHICH MISLEADS HER HERE. SHE IS AWKWARDLY
CIRCUMSTANCED. WITH SUCH WARM FEELINGS AND LIVELY SPIRITS IT MUST BE
DIFFICULT TO DO JUSTICE TO HER AFFECTION FOR MRS. CRAWFORD, WITHOUT
THROWING A SHADE ON THE ADMIRAL. I DO NOT PRETEND TO KNOW WHICH WAS MOST
TO BLAME IN THEIR DISAGREEMENTS, THOUGH THE ADMIRAL'S PRESENT CONDUCT
MIGHT INCLINE ONE TO THE SIDE OF HIS WIFE; BUT IT IS NATURAL AND AMIABLE
THAT MISS CRAWFORD SHOULD ACQUIT HER AUNT ENTIRELY. I DO NOT CENSURE HER
OPINIONS; BUT THERE CERTAINLY IS IMPROPRIETY IN MAKING THEM PUBLIC."

"DO NOT YOU THINK," SAID FANNY, AFTER A LITTLE CONSIDERATION, "THAT THIS
IMPROPRIETY IS A REFLECTION ITSELF UPON MRS. CRAWFORD, AS HER NIECE HAS
BEEN ENTIRELY BROUGHT UP BY HER? SHE CANNOT HAVE GIVEN HER RIGHT NOTIONS
OF WHAT WAS DUE TO THE ADMIRAL."

"THAT IS A FAIR REMARK. YES, WE MUST SUPPOSE THE FAULTS OF THE NIECE
TO HAVE BEEN THOSE OF THE AUNT; AND IT MAKES ONE MORE SENSIBLE OF THE
DISADVANTAGES SHE HAS BEEN UNDER. BUT I THINK HER PRESENT HOME MUST
DO HER GOOD. MRS. GRANT'S MANNERS ARE JUST WHAT THEY OUGHT TO BE. SHE
SPEAKS OF HER BROTHER WITH A VERY PLEASING AFFECTION."

"YES, EXCEPT AS TO HIS WRITING HER SUCH SHORT LETTERS. SHE MADE ME
ALMOST LAUGH; BUT I CANNOT RATE SO VERY HIGHLY THE LOVE OR GOOD-NATURE
OF A BROTHER WHO WILL NOT GIVE HIMSELF THE TROUBLE OF WRITING ANYTHING
WORTH READING TO HIS SISTERS, WHEN THEY ARE SEPARATED. I AM SURE WILLIAM
WOULD NEVER HAVE USED ME SO, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. AND WHAT RIGHT
HAD SHE TO SUPPOSE THAT YOU WOULD NOT WRITE LONG LETTERS WHEN YOU WERE
ABSENT?"

"THE RIGHT OF A LIVELY MIND, FANNY, SEIZING WHATEVER MAY CONTRIBUTE
TO ITS OWN AMUSEMENT OR THAT OF OTHERS; PERFECTLY ALLOWABLE, WHEN
UNTINCTURED BY ILL-HUMOUR OR ROUGHNESS; AND THERE IS NOT A SHADOW OF
EITHER IN THE COUNTENANCE OR MANNER OF MISS CRAWFORD: NOTHING SHARP, OR
LOUD, OR COARSE. SHE IS PERFECTLY FEMININE, EXCEPT IN THE INSTANCES WE
HAVE BEEN SPEAKING OF. THERE SHE CANNOT BE JUSTIFIED. I AM GLAD YOU SAW
IT ALL AS I DID."

HAVING FORMED HER MIND AND GAINED HER AFFECTIONS, HE HAD A GOOD CHANCE
OF HER THINKING LIKE HIM; THOUGH AT THIS PERIOD, AND ON THIS SUBJECT,
THERE BEGAN NOW TO BE SOME DANGER OF DISSIMILARITY, FOR HE WAS IN A LINE
OF ADMIRATION OF MISS CRAWFORD, WHICH MIGHT LEAD HIM WHERE FANNY
COULD NOT FOLLOW. MISS CRAWFORD'S ATTRACTIONS DID NOT LESSEN. THE HARP
ARRIVED, AND RATHER ADDED TO HER BEAUTY, WIT, AND GOOD-HUMOUR; FOR SHE
PLAYED WITH THE GREATEST OBLIGINGNESS, WITH AN EXPRESSION AND TASTE
WHICH WERE PECULIARLY BECOMING, AND THERE WAS SOMETHING CLEVER TO BE
SAID AT THE CLOSE OF EVERY AIR. EDMUND WAS AT THE PARSONAGE EVERY DAY,
TO BE INDULGED WITH HIS FAVOURITE INSTRUMENT: ONE MORNING SECURED AN
INVITATION FOR THE NEXT; FOR THE LADY COULD NOT BE UNWILLING TO HAVE A
LISTENER, AND EVERY THING WAS SOON IN A FAIR TRAIN.

A YOUNG WOMAN, PRETTY, LIVELY, WITH A HARP AS ELEGANT AS HERSELF, AND
BOTH PLACED NEAR A WINDOW, CUT DOWN TO THE GROUND, AND OPENING ON A
LITTLE LAWN, SURROUNDED BY SHRUBS IN THE RICH FOLIAGE OF SUMMER, WAS
ENOUGH TO CATCH ANY MAN'S HEART. THE SEASON, THE SCENE, THE AIR, WERE
ALL FAVOURABLE TO TENDERNESS AND SENTIMENT. MRS. GRANT AND HER TAMBOUR
FRAME WERE NOT WITHOUT THEIR USE: IT WAS ALL IN HARMONY; AND AS
EVERYTHING WILL TURN TO ACCOUNT WHEN LOVE IS ONCE SET GOING, EVEN THE
SANDWICH TRAY, AND DR. GRANT DOING THE HONOURS OF IT, WERE WORTH LOOKING
AT. WITHOUT STUDYING THE BUSINESS, HOWEVER, OR KNOWING WHAT HE WAS
ABOUT, EDMUND WAS BEGINNING, AT THE END OF A WEEK OF SUCH INTERCOURSE,
TO BE A GOOD DEAL IN LOVE; AND TO THE CREDIT OF THE LADY IT MAY BE ADDED
THAT, WITHOUT HIS BEING A MAN OF THE WORLD OR AN ELDER BROTHER, WITHOUT
ANY OF THE ARTS OF FLATTERY OR THE GAIETIES OF SMALL TALK, HE BEGAN TO
BE AGREEABLE TO HER. SHE FELT IT TO BE SO, THOUGH SHE HAD NOT FORESEEN,
AND COULD HARDLY UNDERSTAND IT; FOR HE WAS NOT PLEASANT BY ANY COMMON
RULE: HE TALKED NO NONSENSE; HE PAID NO COMPLIMENTS; HIS OPINIONS
WERE UNBENDING, HIS ATTENTIONS TRANQUIL AND SIMPLE. THERE WAS A CHARM,
PERHAPS, IN HIS SINCERITY, HIS STEADINESS, HIS INTEGRITY, WHICH MISS
CRAWFORD MIGHT BE EQUAL TO FEEL, THOUGH NOT EQUAL TO DISCUSS WITH
HERSELF. SHE DID NOT THINK VERY MUCH ABOUT IT, HOWEVER: HE PLEASED HER
FOR THE PRESENT; SHE LIKED TO HAVE HIM NEAR HER; IT WAS ENOUGH.

FANNY COULD NOT WONDER THAT EDMUND WAS AT THE PARSONAGE EVERY MORNING;
SHE WOULD GLADLY HAVE BEEN THERE TOO, MIGHT SHE HAVE GONE IN UNINVITED
AND UNNOTICED, TO HEAR THE HARP; NEITHER COULD SHE WONDER THAT, WHEN THE
EVENING STROLL WAS OVER, AND THE TWO FAMILIES PARTED AGAIN, HE SHOULD
THINK IT RIGHT TO ATTEND MRS. GRANT AND HER SISTER TO THEIR HOME, WHILE
MR. CRAWFORD WAS DEVOTED TO THE LADIES OF THE PARK; BUT SHE THOUGHT IT
A VERY BAD EXCHANGE; AND IF EDMUND WERE NOT THERE TO MIX THE WINE AND
WATER FOR HER, WOULD RATHER GO WITHOUT IT THAN NOT. SHE WAS A LITTLE
SURPRISED THAT HE COULD SPEND SO MANY HOURS WITH MISS CRAWFORD, AND
NOT SEE MORE OF THE SORT OF FAULT WHICH HE HAD ALREADY OBSERVED, AND OF
WHICH SHE WAS ALMOST ALWAYS REMINDED BY A SOMETHING OF THE SAME NATURE
WHENEVER SHE WAS IN HER COMPANY; BUT SO IT WAS. EDMUND WAS FOND OF
SPEAKING TO HER OF MISS CRAWFORD, BUT HE SEEMED TO THINK IT ENOUGH THAT
THE ADMIRAL HAD SINCE BEEN SPARED; AND SHE SCRUPLED TO POINT OUT HER OWN
REMARKS TO HIM, LEST IT SHOULD APPEAR LIKE ILL-NATURE. THE FIRST ACTUAL
PAIN WHICH MISS CRAWFORD OCCASIONED HER WAS THE CONSEQUENCE OF AN
INCLINATION TO LEARN TO RIDE, WHICH THE FORMER CAUGHT, SOON AFTER HER
BEING SETTLED AT MANSFIELD, FROM THE EXAMPLE OF THE YOUNG LADIES AT THE
PARK, AND WHICH, WHEN EDMUND'S ACQUAINTANCE WITH HER INCREASED, LED TO
HIS ENCOURAGING THE WISH, AND THE OFFER OF HIS OWN QUIET MARE FOR THE
PURPOSE OF HER FIRST ATTEMPTS, AS THE BEST FITTED FOR A BEGINNER THAT
EITHER STABLE COULD FURNISH. NO PAIN, NO INJURY, HOWEVER, WAS DESIGNED
BY HIM TO HIS COUSIN IN THIS OFFER: SHE WAS NOT TO LOSE A DAY'S
EXERCISE BY IT. THE MARE WAS ONLY TO BE TAKEN DOWN TO THE PARSONAGE HALF
AN HOUR BEFORE HER RIDE WERE TO BEGIN; AND FANNY, ON ITS BEING FIRST
PROPOSED, SO FAR FROM FEELING SLIGHTED, WAS ALMOST OVER-POWERED WITH
GRATITUDE THAT HE SHOULD BE ASKING HER LEAVE FOR IT.

MISS CRAWFORD MADE HER FIRST ESSAY WITH GREAT CREDIT TO HERSELF, AND NO
INCONVENIENCE TO FANNY. EDMUND, WHO HAD TAKEN DOWN THE MARE AND PRESIDED
AT THE WHOLE, RETURNED WITH IT IN EXCELLENT TIME, BEFORE EITHER FANNY OR
THE STEADY OLD COACHMAN, WHO ALWAYS ATTENDED HER WHEN SHE RODE WITHOUT
HER COUSINS, WERE READY TO SET FORWARD. THE SECOND DAY'S TRIAL WAS NOT
SO GUILTLESS. MISS CRAWFORD'S ENJOYMENT OF RIDING WAS SUCH THAT SHE DID
NOT KNOW HOW TO LEAVE OFF. ACTIVE AND FEARLESS, AND THOUGH RATHER SMALL,
STRONGLY MADE, SHE SEEMED FORMED FOR A HORSEWOMAN; AND TO THE PURE
GENUINE PLEASURE OF THE EXERCISE, SOMETHING WAS PROBABLY ADDED IN
EDMUND'S ATTENDANCE AND INSTRUCTIONS, AND SOMETHING MORE IN THE
CONVICTION OF VERY MUCH SURPASSING HER SEX IN GENERAL BY HER EARLY
PROGRESS, TO MAKE HER UNWILLING TO DISMOUNT. FANNY WAS READY AND
WAITING, AND MRS. NORRIS WAS BEGINNING TO SCOLD HER FOR NOT BEING GONE,
AND STILL NO HORSE WAS ANNOUNCED, NO EDMUND APPEARED. TO AVOID HER AUNT,
AND LOOK FOR HIM, SHE WENT OUT.

THE HOUSES, THOUGH SCARCELY HALF A MILE APART, WERE NOT WITHIN SIGHT OF
EACH OTHER; BUT, BY WALKING FIFTY YARDS FROM THE HALL DOOR, SHE COULD
LOOK DOWN THE PARK, AND COMMAND A VIEW OF THE PARSONAGE AND ALL ITS
DEMESNES, GENTLY RISING BEYOND THE VILLAGE ROAD; AND IN DR. GRANT'S
MEADOW SHE IMMEDIATELY SAW THE GROUP--EDMUND AND MISS CRAWFORD BOTH ON
HORSE-BACK, RIDING SIDE BY SIDE, DR. AND MRS. GRANT, AND MR. CRAWFORD,
WITH TWO OR THREE GROOMS, STANDING ABOUT AND LOOKING ON. A HAPPY PARTY
IT APPEARED TO HER, ALL INTERESTED IN ONE OBJECT: CHEERFUL BEYOND A
DOUBT, FOR THE SOUND OF MERRIMENT ASCENDED EVEN TO HER. IT WAS A SOUND
WHICH DID NOT MAKE HER CHEERFUL; SHE WONDERED THAT EDMUND SHOULD
FORGET HER, AND FELT A PANG. SHE COULD NOT TURN HER EYES FROM THE
MEADOW; SHE COULD NOT HELP WATCHING ALL THAT PASSED. AT FIRST MISS
CRAWFORD AND HER COMPANION MADE THE CIRCUIT OF THE FIELD, WHICH WAS NOT
SMALL, AT A FOOT'S PACE; THEN, AT HER APPARENT SUGGESTION, THEY ROSE
INTO A CANTER; AND TO FANNY'S TIMID NATURE IT WAS MOST ASTONISHING TO
SEE HOW WELL SHE SAT. AFTER A FEW MINUTES THEY STOPPED ENTIRELY. EDMUND
WAS CLOSE TO HER; HE WAS SPEAKING TO HER; HE WAS EVIDENTLY DIRECTING HER
MANAGEMENT OF THE BRIDLE; HE HAD HOLD OF HER HAND; SHE SAW IT, OR THE
IMAGINATION SUPPLIED WHAT THE EYE COULD NOT REACH. SHE MUST NOT WONDER
AT ALL THIS; WHAT COULD BE MORE NATURAL THAN THAT EDMUND SHOULD BE
MAKING HIMSELF USEFUL, AND PROVING HIS GOOD-NATURE BY ANY ONE? SHE COULD
NOT BUT THINK, INDEED, THAT MR. CRAWFORD MIGHT AS WELL HAVE SAVED HIM
THE TROUBLE; THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN PARTICULARLY PROPER AND BECOMING
IN A BROTHER TO HAVE DONE IT HIMSELF; BUT MR. CRAWFORD, WITH ALL HIS
BOASTED GOOD-NATURE, AND ALL HIS COACHMANSHIP, PROBABLY KNEW NOTHING
OF THE MATTER, AND HAD NO ACTIVE KINDNESS IN COMPARISON OF EDMUND. SHE
BEGAN TO THINK IT RATHER HARD UPON THE MARE TO HAVE SUCH DOUBLE DUTY; IF
SHE WERE FORGOTTEN, THE POOR MARE SHOULD BE REMEMBERED.

HER FEELINGS FOR ONE AND THE OTHER WERE SOON A LITTLE TRANQUILLISED
BY SEEING THE PARTY IN THE MEADOW DISPERSE, AND MISS CRAWFORD STILL ON
HORSEBACK, BUT ATTENDED BY EDMUND ON FOOT, PASS THROUGH A GATE INTO THE
LANE, AND SO INTO THE PARK, AND MAKE TOWARDS THE SPOT WHERE SHE STOOD.
SHE BEGAN THEN TO BE AFRAID OF APPEARING RUDE AND IMPATIENT; AND WALKED
TO MEET THEM WITH A GREAT ANXIETY TO AVOID THE SUSPICION.

"MY DEAR MISS PRICE," SAID MISS CRAWFORD, AS SOON AS SHE WAS AT ALL
WITHIN HEARING, "I AM COME TO MAKE MY OWN APOLOGIES FOR KEEPING YOU
WAITING; BUT I HAVE NOTHING IN THE WORLD TO SAY FOR MYSELF--I KNEW IT
WAS VERY LATE, AND THAT I WAS BEHAVING EXTREMELY ILL; AND THEREFORE, IF
YOU PLEASE, YOU MUST FORGIVE ME. SELFISHNESS MUST ALWAYS BE FORGIVEN,
YOU KNOW, BECAUSE THERE IS NO HOPE OF A CURE."

FANNY'S ANSWER WAS EXTREMELY CIVIL, AND EDMUND ADDED HIS CONVICTION THAT
SHE COULD BE IN NO HURRY. "FOR THERE IS MORE THAN TIME ENOUGH FOR MY
COUSIN TO RIDE TWICE AS FAR AS SHE EVER GOES," SAID HE, "AND YOU HAVE
BEEN PROMOTING HER COMFORT BY PREVENTING HER FROM SETTING OFF HALF AN
HOUR SOONER: CLOUDS ARE NOW COMING UP, AND SHE WILL NOT SUFFER FROM THE
HEAT AS SHE WOULD HAVE DONE THEN. I WISH YOU MAY NOT BE FATIGUED BY SO
MUCH EXERCISE. I WISH YOU HAD SAVED YOURSELF THIS WALK HOME."

"NO PART OF IT FATIGUES ME BUT GETTING OFF THIS HORSE, I ASSURE YOU,"
SAID SHE, AS SHE SPRANG DOWN WITH HIS HELP; "I AM VERY STRONG. NOTHING
EVER FATIGUES ME BUT DOING WHAT I DO NOT LIKE. MISS PRICE, I GIVE WAY TO
YOU WITH A VERY BAD GRACE; BUT I SINCERELY HOPE YOU WILL HAVE A PLEASANT
RIDE, AND THAT I MAY HAVE NOTHING BUT GOOD TO HEAR OF THIS DEAR,
DELIGHTFUL, BEAUTIFUL ANIMAL."

THE OLD COACHMAN, WHO HAD BEEN WAITING ABOUT WITH HIS OWN HORSE, NOW
JOINING THEM, FANNY WAS LIFTED ON HERS, AND THEY SET OFF ACROSS ANOTHER
PART OF THE PARK; HER FEELINGS OF DISCOMFORT NOT LIGHTENED BY SEEING, AS
SHE LOOKED BACK, THAT THE OTHERS WERE WALKING DOWN THE HILL TOGETHER TO
THE VILLAGE; NOR DID HER ATTENDANT DO HER MUCH GOOD BY HIS COMMENTS ON
MISS CRAWFORD'S GREAT CLEVERNESS AS A HORSE-WOMAN, WHICH HE HAD BEEN
WATCHING WITH AN INTEREST ALMOST EQUAL TO HER OWN.

"IT IS A PLEASURE TO SEE A LADY WITH SUCH A GOOD HEART FOR RIDING!"
SAID HE. "I NEVER SEE ONE SIT A HORSE BETTER. SHE DID NOT SEEM TO HAVE
A THOUGHT OF FEAR. VERY DIFFERENT FROM YOU, MISS, WHEN YOU FIRST BEGAN,
SIX YEARS AGO COME NEXT EASTER. LORD BLESS YOU! HOW YOU DID TREMBLE WHEN
SIR THOMAS FIRST HAD YOU PUT ON!"

IN THE DRAWING-ROOM MISS CRAWFORD WAS ALSO CELEBRATED. HER MERIT IN
BEING GIFTED BY NATURE WITH STRENGTH AND COURAGE WAS FULLY APPRECIATED
BY THE MISS BERTRAMS; HER DELIGHT IN RIDING WAS LIKE THEIR OWN; HER
EARLY EXCELLENCE IN IT WAS LIKE THEIR OWN, AND THEY HAD GREAT PLEASURE
IN PRAISING IT.

"I WAS SURE SHE WOULD RIDE WELL," SAID JULIA; "SHE HAS THE MAKE FOR IT.
HER FIGURE IS AS NEAT AS HER BROTHER'S."

"YES," ADDED MARIA, "AND HER SPIRITS ARE AS GOOD, AND SHE HAS THE SAME
ENERGY OF CHARACTER. I CANNOT BUT THINK THAT GOOD HORSEMANSHIP HAS A
GREAT DEAL TO DO WITH THE MIND."

WHEN THEY PARTED AT NIGHT EDMUND ASKED FANNY WHETHER SHE MEANT TO RIDE
THE NEXT DAY.

"NO, I DO NOT KNOW--NOT IF YOU WANT THE MARE," WAS HER ANSWER.

"I DO NOT WANT HER AT ALL FOR MYSELF," SAID HE; "BUT WHENEVER YOU ARE
NEXT INCLINED TO STAY AT HOME, I THINK MISS CRAWFORD WOULD BE GLAD TO
HAVE HER A LONGER TIME--FOR A WHOLE MORNING, IN SHORT. SHE HAS A GREAT
DESIRE TO GET AS FAR AS MANSFIELD COMMON: MRS. GRANT HAS BEEN TELLING
HER OF ITS FINE VIEWS, AND I HAVE NO DOUBT OF HER BEING PERFECTLY EQUAL
TO IT. BUT ANY MORNING WILL DO FOR THIS. SHE WOULD BE EXTREMELY SORRY TO
INTERFERE WITH YOU. IT WOULD BE VERY WRONG IF SHE DID. SHE RIDES ONLY
FOR PLEASURE; YOU FOR HEALTH."

"I SHALL NOT RIDE TO-MORROW, CERTAINLY," SAID FANNY; "I HAVE BEEN OUT
VERY OFTEN LATELY, AND WOULD RATHER STAY AT HOME. YOU KNOW I AM STRONG
ENOUGH NOW TO WALK VERY WELL."

EDMUND LOOKED PLEASED, WHICH MUST BE FANNY'S COMFORT, AND THE RIDE TO
MANSFIELD COMMON TOOK PLACE THE NEXT MORNING: THE PARTY INCLUDED ALL THE
YOUNG PEOPLE BUT HERSELF, AND WAS MUCH ENJOYED AT THE TIME, AND DOUBLY
ENJOYED AGAIN IN THE EVENING DISCUSSION. A SUCCESSFUL SCHEME OF THIS
SORT GENERALLY BRINGS ON ANOTHER; AND THE HAVING BEEN TO MANSFIELD
COMMON DISPOSED THEM ALL FOR GOING SOMEWHERE ELSE THE DAY AFTER. THERE
WERE MANY OTHER VIEWS TO BE SHEWN; AND THOUGH THE WEATHER WAS HOT, THERE
WERE SHADY LANES WHEREVER THEY WANTED TO GO. A YOUNG PARTY IS ALWAYS
PROVIDED WITH A SHADY LANE. FOUR FINE MORNINGS SUCCESSIVELY WERE SPENT
IN THIS MANNER, IN SHEWING THE CRAWFORDS THE COUNTRY, AND DOING THE
HONOURS OF ITS FINEST SPOTS. EVERYTHING ANSWERED; IT WAS ALL GAIETY AND
GOOD-HUMOUR, THE HEAT ONLY SUPPLYING INCONVENIENCE ENOUGH TO BE TALKED
OF WITH PLEASURE--TILL THE FOURTH DAY, WHEN THE HAPPINESS OF ONE OF
THE PARTY WAS EXCEEDINGLY CLOUDED. MISS BERTRAM WAS THE ONE. EDMUND AND
JULIA WERE INVITED TO DINE AT THE PARSONAGE, AND SHE WAS EXCLUDED.
IT WAS MEANT AND DONE BY MRS. GRANT, WITH PERFECT GOOD-HUMOUR, ON MR.
RUSHWORTH'S ACCOUNT, WHO WAS PARTLY EXPECTED AT THE PARK THAT DAY;
BUT IT WAS FELT AS A VERY GRIEVOUS INJURY, AND HER GOOD MANNERS WERE
SEVERELY TAXED TO CONCEAL HER VEXATION AND ANGER TILL SHE REACHED HOME.
AS MR. RUSHWORTH DID NOT COME, THE INJURY WAS INCREASED, AND SHE HAD
NOT EVEN THE RELIEF OF SHEWING HER POWER OVER HIM; SHE COULD ONLY BE
SULLEN TO HER MOTHER, AUNT, AND COUSIN, AND THROW AS GREAT A GLOOM AS
POSSIBLE OVER THEIR DINNER AND DESSERT.

BETWEEN TEN AND ELEVEN EDMUND AND JULIA WALKED INTO THE DRAWING-ROOM,
FRESH WITH THE EVENING AIR, GLOWING AND CHEERFUL, THE VERY REVERSE
OF WHAT THEY FOUND IN THE THREE LADIES SITTING THERE, FOR MARIA WOULD
SCARCELY RAISE HER EYES FROM HER BOOK, AND LADY BERTRAM WAS HALF-ASLEEP;
AND EVEN MRS. NORRIS, DISCOMPOSED BY HER NIECE'S ILL-HUMOUR, AND HAVING
ASKED ONE OR TWO QUESTIONS ABOUT THE DINNER, WHICH WERE NOT IMMEDIATELY
ATTENDED TO, SEEMED ALMOST DETERMINED TO SAY NO MORE. FOR A FEW MINUTES
THE BROTHER AND SISTER WERE TOO EAGER IN THEIR PRAISE OF THE NIGHT AND
THEIR REMARKS ON THE STARS, TO THINK BEYOND THEMSELVES; BUT WHEN THE
FIRST PAUSE CAME, EDMUND, LOOKING AROUND, SAID, "BUT WHERE IS FANNY? IS
SHE GONE TO BED?"

"NO, NOT THAT I KNOW OF," REPLIED MRS. NORRIS; "SHE WAS HERE A MOMENT
AGO."

HER OWN GENTLE VOICE SPEAKING FROM THE OTHER END OF THE ROOM, WHICH WAS
A VERY LONG ONE, TOLD THEM THAT SHE WAS ON THE SOFA. MRS. NORRIS BEGAN
SCOLDING.

"THAT IS A VERY FOOLISH TRICK, FANNY, TO BE IDLING AWAY ALL THE EVENING
UPON A SOFA. WHY CANNOT YOU COME AND SIT HERE, AND EMPLOY YOURSELF AS
WE DO? IF YOU HAVE NO WORK OF YOUR OWN, I CAN SUPPLY YOU FROM THE
POOR BASKET. THERE IS ALL THE NEW CALICO, THAT WAS BOUGHT LAST WEEK,
NOT TOUCHED YET. I AM SURE I ALMOST BROKE MY BACK BY CUTTING IT OUT. YOU
SHOULD LEARN TO THINK OF OTHER PEOPLE; AND, TAKE MY WORD FOR IT, IT IS A
SHOCKING TRICK FOR A YOUNG PERSON TO BE ALWAYS LOLLING UPON A SOFA."

BEFORE HALF THIS WAS SAID, FANNY WAS RETURNED TO HER SEAT AT THE TABLE,
AND HAD TAKEN UP HER WORK AGAIN; AND JULIA, WHO WAS IN HIGH GOOD-HUMOUR,
FROM THE PLEASURES OF THE DAY, DID HER THE JUSTICE OF EXCLAIMING, "I
MUST SAY, MA'AM, THAT FANNY IS AS LITTLE UPON THE SOFA AS ANYBODY IN THE
HOUSE."

"FANNY," SAID EDMUND, AFTER LOOKING AT HER ATTENTIVELY, "I AM SURE YOU
HAVE THE HEADACHE."

SHE COULD NOT DENY IT, BUT SAID IT WAS NOT VERY BAD.

"I CAN HARDLY BELIEVE YOU," HE REPLIED; "I KNOW YOUR LOOKS TOO WELL. HOW
LONG HAVE YOU HAD IT?"

"SINCE A LITTLE BEFORE DINNER. IT IS NOTHING BUT THE HEAT."

"DID YOU GO OUT IN THE HEAT?"

"GO OUT! TO BE SURE SHE DID," SAID MRS. NORRIS: "WOULD YOU HAVE HER STAY
WITHIN SUCH A FINE DAY AS THIS? WERE NOT WE ALL OUT? EVEN YOUR MOTHER
WAS OUT TO-DAY FOR ABOVE AN HOUR."

"YES, INDEED, EDMUND," ADDED HER LADYSHIP, WHO HAD BEEN THOROUGHLY
AWAKENED BY MRS. NORRIS'S SHARP REPRIMAND TO FANNY; "I WAS OUT ABOVE AN
HOUR. I SAT THREE-QUARTERS OF AN HOUR IN THE FLOWER-GARDEN, WHILE FANNY
CUT THE ROSES; AND VERY PLEASANT IT WAS, I ASSURE YOU, BUT VERY HOT. IT
WAS SHADY ENOUGH IN THE ALCOVE, BUT I DECLARE I QUITE DREADED THE COMING
HOME AGAIN."

"FANNY HAS BEEN CUTTING ROSES, HAS SHE?"

"YES, AND I AM AFRAID THEY WILL BE THE LAST THIS YEAR. POOR THING! SHE
FOUND IT HOT ENOUGH; BUT THEY WERE SO FULL-BLOWN THAT ONE COULD NOT
WAIT."

"THERE WAS NO HELP FOR IT, CERTAINLY," REJOINED MRS. NORRIS, IN A RATHER
SOFTENED VOICE; "BUT I QUESTION WHETHER HER HEADACHE MIGHT NOT BE CAUGHT
THEN, SISTER. THERE IS NOTHING SO LIKELY TO GIVE IT AS STANDING AND
STOOPING IN A HOT SUN; BUT I DARE SAY IT WILL BE WELL TO-MORROW. SUPPOSE
YOU LET HER HAVE YOUR AROMATIC VINEGAR; I ALWAYS FORGET TO HAVE MINE
FILLED."

"SHE HAS GOT IT," SAID LADY BERTRAM; "SHE HAS HAD IT EVER SINCE SHE CAME
BACK FROM YOUR HOUSE THE SECOND TIME."

"WHAT!" CRIED EDMUND; "HAS SHE BEEN WALKING AS WELL AS CUTTING ROSES;
WALKING ACROSS THE HOT PARK TO YOUR HOUSE, AND DOING IT TWICE, MA'AM? NO
WONDER HER HEAD ACHES."

MRS. NORRIS WAS TALKING TO JULIA, AND DID NOT HEAR.

"I WAS AFRAID IT WOULD BE TOO MUCH FOR HER," SAID LADY BERTRAM; "BUT
WHEN THE ROSES WERE GATHERED, YOUR AUNT WISHED TO HAVE THEM, AND THEN
YOU KNOW THEY MUST BE TAKEN HOME."

"BUT WERE THERE ROSES ENOUGH TO OBLIGE HER TO GO TWICE?"

"NO; BUT THEY WERE TO BE PUT INTO THE SPARE ROOM TO DRY; AND, UNLUCKILY,
FANNY FORGOT TO LOCK THE DOOR OF THE ROOM AND BRING AWAY THE KEY, SO SHE
WAS OBLIGED TO GO AGAIN."

EDMUND GOT UP AND WALKED ABOUT THE ROOM, SAYING, "AND COULD NOBODY BE
EMPLOYED ON SUCH AN ERRAND BUT FANNY? UPON MY WORD, MA'AM, IT HAS BEEN A
VERY ILL-MANAGED BUSINESS."

"I AM SURE I DO NOT KNOW HOW IT WAS TO HAVE BEEN DONE BETTER," CRIED
MRS. NORRIS, UNABLE TO BE LONGER DEAF; "UNLESS I HAD GONE MYSELF,
INDEED; BUT I CANNOT BE IN TWO PLACES AT ONCE; AND I WAS TALKING TO MR.
GREEN AT THAT VERY TIME ABOUT YOUR MOTHER'S DAIRYMAID, BY HER DESIRE,
AND HAD PROMISED JOHN GROOM TO WRITE TO MRS. JEFFERIES ABOUT HIS SON,
AND THE POOR FELLOW WAS WAITING FOR ME HALF AN HOUR. I THINK NOBODY
CAN JUSTLY ACCUSE ME OF SPARING MYSELF UPON ANY OCCASION, BUT REALLY I
CANNOT DO EVERYTHING AT ONCE. AND AS FOR FANNY'S JUST STEPPING DOWN
TO MY HOUSE FOR ME--IT IS NOT MUCH ABOVE A QUARTER OF A MILE--I CANNOT
THINK I WAS UNREASONABLE TO ASK IT. HOW OFTEN DO I PACE IT THREE TIMES A
DAY, EARLY AND LATE, AY, AND IN ALL WEATHERS TOO, AND SAY NOTHING ABOUT
IT?"

"I WISH FANNY HAD HALF YOUR STRENGTH, MA'AM."

"IF FANNY WOULD BE MORE REGULAR IN HER EXERCISE, SHE WOULD NOT BE
KNOCKED UP SO SOON. SHE HAS NOT BEEN OUT ON HORSEBACK NOW THIS LONG
WHILE, AND I AM PERSUADED THAT, WHEN SHE DOES NOT RIDE, SHE OUGHT TO
WALK. IF SHE HAD BEEN RIDING BEFORE, I SHOULD NOT HAVE ASKED IT OF HER.
BUT I THOUGHT IT WOULD RATHER DO HER GOOD AFTER BEING STOOPING AMONG THE
ROSES; FOR THERE IS NOTHING SO REFRESHING AS A WALK AFTER A FATIGUE
OF THAT KIND; AND THOUGH THE SUN WAS STRONG, IT WAS NOT SO VERY HOT.
BETWEEN OURSELVES, EDMUND," NODDING SIGNIFICANTLY AT HIS MOTHER, "IT WAS
CUTTING THE ROSES, AND DAWDLING ABOUT IN THE FLOWER-GARDEN, THAT DID THE
MISCHIEF."

"I AM AFRAID IT WAS, INDEED," SAID THE MORE CANDID LADY BERTRAM, WHO HAD
OVERHEARD HER; "I AM VERY MUCH AFRAID SHE CAUGHT THE HEADACHE THERE,
FOR THE HEAT WAS ENOUGH TO KILL ANYBODY. IT WAS AS MUCH AS I COULD BEAR
MYSELF. SITTING AND CALLING TO PUG, AND TRYING TO KEEP HIM FROM THE
FLOWER-BEDS, WAS ALMOST TOO MUCH FOR ME."

EDMUND SAID NO MORE TO EITHER LADY; BUT GOING QUIETLY TO ANOTHER TABLE,
ON WHICH THE SUPPER-TRAY YET REMAINED, BROUGHT A GLASS OF MADEIRA TO
FANNY, AND OBLIGED HER TO DRINK THE GREATER PART. SHE WISHED TO BE ABLE
TO DECLINE IT; BUT THE TEARS, WHICH A VARIETY OF FEELINGS CREATED, MADE
IT EASIER TO SWALLOW THAN TO SPEAK.

VEXED AS EDMUND WAS WITH HIS MOTHER AND AUNT, HE WAS STILL MORE ANGRY
WITH HIMSELF. HIS OWN FORGETFULNESS OF HER WAS WORSE THAN ANYTHING WHICH
THEY HAD DONE. NOTHING OF THIS WOULD HAVE HAPPENED HAD SHE BEEN PROPERLY
CONSIDERED; BUT SHE HAD BEEN LEFT FOUR DAYS TOGETHER WITHOUT ANY CHOICE
OF COMPANIONS OR EXERCISE, AND WITHOUT ANY EXCUSE FOR AVOIDING WHATEVER
HER UNREASONABLE AUNTS MIGHT REQUIRE. HE WAS ASHAMED TO THINK THAT
FOR FOUR DAYS TOGETHER SHE HAD NOT HAD THE POWER OF RIDING, AND VERY
SERIOUSLY RESOLVED, HOWEVER UNWILLING HE MUST BE TO CHECK A PLEASURE OF
MISS CRAWFORD'S, THAT IT SHOULD NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN.

FANNY WENT TO BED WITH HER HEART AS FULL AS ON THE FIRST EVENING OF HER
ARRIVAL AT THE PARK. THE STATE OF HER SPIRITS HAD PROBABLY HAD ITS
SHARE IN HER INDISPOSITION; FOR SHE HAD BEEN FEELING NEGLECTED, AND BEEN
STRUGGLING AGAINST DISCONTENT AND ENVY FOR SOME DAYS PAST. AS SHE LEANT
ON THE SOFA, TO WHICH SHE HAD RETREATED THAT SHE MIGHT NOT BE SEEN, THE
PAIN OF HER MIND HAD BEEN MUCH BEYOND THAT IN HER HEAD; AND THE SUDDEN
CHANGE WHICH EDMUND'S KINDNESS HAD THEN OCCASIONED, MADE HER HARDLY KNOW
HOW TO SUPPORT HERSELF.



CHAPTER VIII

FANNY'S RIDES RECOMMENCED THE VERY NEXT DAY; AND AS IT WAS A PLEASANT
FRESH-FEELING MORNING, LESS HOT THAN THE WEATHER HAD LATELY BEEN, EDMUND
TRUSTED THAT HER LOSSES, BOTH OF HEALTH AND PLEASURE, WOULD BE SOON MADE
GOOD. WHILE SHE WAS GONE MR. RUSHWORTH ARRIVED, ESCORTING HIS MOTHER,
WHO CAME TO BE CIVIL AND TO SHEW HER CIVILITY ESPECIALLY, IN URGING THE
EXECUTION OF THE PLAN FOR VISITING SOTHERTON, WHICH HAD BEEN STARTED A
FORTNIGHT BEFORE, AND WHICH, IN CONSEQUENCE OF HER SUBSEQUENT ABSENCE
FROM HOME, HAD SINCE LAIN DORMANT. MRS. NORRIS AND HER NIECES WERE ALL
WELL PLEASED WITH ITS REVIVAL, AND AN EARLY DAY WAS NAMED AND AGREED
TO, PROVIDED MR. CRAWFORD SHOULD BE DISENGAGED: THE YOUNG LADIES DID
NOT FORGET THAT STIPULATION, AND THOUGH MRS. NORRIS WOULD WILLINGLY HAVE
ANSWERED FOR HIS BEING SO, THEY WOULD NEITHER AUTHORISE THE LIBERTY NOR
RUN THE RISK; AND AT LAST, ON A HINT FROM MISS BERTRAM, MR. RUSHWORTH
DISCOVERED THAT THE PROPEREST THING TO BE DONE WAS FOR HIM TO WALK DOWN
TO THE PARSONAGE DIRECTLY, AND CALL ON MR. CRAWFORD, AND INQUIRE WHETHER
WEDNESDAY WOULD SUIT HIM OR NOT.

BEFORE HIS RETURN MRS. GRANT AND MISS CRAWFORD CAME IN. HAVING BEEN OUT
SOME TIME, AND TAKEN A DIFFERENT ROUTE TO THE HOUSE, THEY HAD NOT MET
HIM. COMFORTABLE HOPES, HOWEVER, WERE GIVEN THAT HE WOULD FIND MR.
CRAWFORD AT HOME. THE SOTHERTON SCHEME WAS MENTIONED OF COURSE. IT WAS
HARDLY POSSIBLE, INDEED, THAT ANYTHING ELSE SHOULD BE TALKED OF,
FOR MRS. NORRIS WAS IN HIGH SPIRITS ABOUT IT; AND MRS. RUSHWORTH, A
WELL-MEANING, CIVIL, PROSING, POMPOUS WOMAN, WHO THOUGHT NOTHING OF
CONSEQUENCE, BUT AS IT RELATED TO HER OWN AND HER SON'S CONCERNS,
HAD NOT YET GIVEN OVER PRESSING LADY BERTRAM TO BE OF THE PARTY. LADY
BERTRAM CONSTANTLY DECLINED IT; BUT HER PLACID MANNER OF REFUSAL MADE
MRS. RUSHWORTH STILL THINK SHE WISHED TO COME, TILL MRS. NORRIS'S MORE
NUMEROUS WORDS AND LOUDER TONE CONVINCED HER OF THE TRUTH.

"THE FATIGUE WOULD BE TOO MUCH FOR MY SISTER, A GREAT DEAL TOO MUCH, I
ASSURE YOU, MY DEAR MRS. RUSHWORTH. TEN MILES THERE, AND TEN BACK, YOU
KNOW. YOU MUST EXCUSE MY SISTER ON THIS OCCASION, AND ACCEPT OF OUR
TWO DEAR GIRLS AND MYSELF WITHOUT HER. SOTHERTON IS THE ONLY PLACE THAT
COULD GIVE HER A WISH TO GO SO FAR, BUT IT CANNOT BE, INDEED. SHE WILL
HAVE A COMPANION IN FANNY PRICE, YOU KNOW, SO IT WILL ALL DO VERY WELL;
AND AS FOR EDMUND, AS HE IS NOT HERE TO SPEAK FOR HIMSELF, I WILL ANSWER
FOR HIS BEING MOST HAPPY TO JOIN THE PARTY. HE CAN GO ON HORSEBACK, YOU
KNOW."

MRS. RUSHWORTH BEING OBLIGED TO YIELD TO LADY BERTRAM'S STAYING AT HOME,
COULD ONLY BE SORRY. "THE LOSS OF HER LADYSHIP'S COMPANY WOULD BE A
GREAT DRAWBACK, AND SHE SHOULD HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY HAPPY TO HAVE SEEN
THE YOUNG LADY TOO, MISS PRICE, WHO HAD NEVER BEEN AT SOTHERTON YET, AND
IT WAS A PITY SHE SHOULD NOT SEE THE PLACE."

"YOU ARE VERY KIND, YOU ARE ALL KINDNESS, MY DEAR MADAM," CRIED MRS.
NORRIS; "BUT AS TO FANNY, SHE WILL HAVE OPPORTUNITIES IN PLENTY OF
SEEING SOTHERTON. SHE HAS TIME ENOUGH BEFORE HER; AND HER GOING NOW IS
QUITE OUT OF THE QUESTION. LADY BERTRAM COULD NOT POSSIBLY SPARE HER."

"OH NO! I CANNOT DO WITHOUT FANNY."

MRS. RUSHWORTH PROCEEDED NEXT, UNDER THE CONVICTION THAT EVERYBODY MUST
BE WANTING TO SEE SOTHERTON, TO INCLUDE MISS CRAWFORD IN THE INVITATION;
AND THOUGH MRS. GRANT, WHO HAD NOT BEEN AT THE TROUBLE OF VISITING MRS.
RUSHWORTH, ON HER COMING INTO THE NEIGHBOURHOOD, CIVILLY DECLINED IT ON
HER OWN ACCOUNT, SHE WAS GLAD TO SECURE ANY PLEASURE FOR HER SISTER;
AND MARY, PROPERLY PRESSED AND PERSUADED, WAS NOT LONG IN ACCEPTING
HER SHARE OF THE CIVILITY. MR. RUSHWORTH CAME BACK FROM THE PARSONAGE
SUCCESSFUL; AND EDMUND MADE HIS APPEARANCE JUST IN TIME TO LEARN
WHAT HAD BEEN SETTLED FOR WEDNESDAY, TO ATTEND MRS. RUSHWORTH TO HER
CARRIAGE, AND WALK HALF-WAY DOWN THE PARK WITH THE TWO OTHER LADIES.

ON HIS RETURN TO THE BREAKFAST-ROOM, HE FOUND MRS. NORRIS TRYING TO
MAKE UP HER MIND AS TO WHETHER MISS CRAWFORD'S BEING OF THE PARTY WERE
DESIRABLE OR NOT, OR WHETHER HER BROTHER'S BAROUCHE WOULD NOT BE FULL
WITHOUT HER. THE MISS BERTRAMS LAUGHED AT THE IDEA, ASSURING HER THAT
THE BAROUCHE WOULD HOLD FOUR PERFECTLY WELL, INDEPENDENT OF THE BOX, ON
WHICH ONE MIGHT GO WITH HIM.

"BUT WHY IS IT NECESSARY," SAID EDMUND, "THAT CRAWFORD'S CARRIAGE, OR
HIS ONLY, SHOULD BE EMPLOYED? WHY IS NO USE TO BE MADE OF MY MOTHER'S
CHAISE? I COULD NOT, WHEN THE SCHEME WAS FIRST MENTIONED THE OTHER
DAY, UNDERSTAND WHY A VISIT FROM THE FAMILY WERE NOT TO BE MADE IN THE
CARRIAGE OF THE FAMILY."

"WHAT!" CRIED JULIA: "GO BOXED UP THREE IN A POSTCHAISE IN THIS WEATHER,
WHEN WE MAY HAVE SEATS IN A BAROUCHE! NO, MY DEAR EDMUND, THAT WILL NOT
QUITE DO."

"BESIDES," SAID MARIA, "I KNOW THAT MR. CRAWFORD DEPENDS UPON TAKING US.
AFTER WHAT PASSED AT FIRST, HE WOULD CLAIM IT AS A PROMISE."

"AND, MY DEAR EDMUND," ADDED MRS. NORRIS, "TAKING OUT TWO CARRIAGES
WHEN ONE WILL DO, WOULD BE TROUBLE FOR NOTHING; AND, BETWEEN
OURSELVES, COACHMAN IS NOT VERY FOND OF THE ROADS BETWEEN THIS AND
SOTHERTON: HE ALWAYS COMPLAINS BITTERLY OF THE NARROW LANES SCRATCHING
HIS CARRIAGE, AND YOU KNOW ONE SHOULD NOT LIKE TO HAVE DEAR SIR THOMAS,
WHEN HE COMES HOME, FIND ALL THE VARNISH SCRATCHED OFF."

"THAT WOULD NOT BE A VERY HANDSOME REASON FOR USING MR. CRAWFORD'S,"
SAID MARIA; "BUT THE TRUTH IS, THAT WILCOX IS A STUPID OLD FELLOW, AND
DOES NOT KNOW HOW TO DRIVE. I WILL ANSWER FOR IT THAT WE SHALL FIND NO
INCONVENIENCE FROM NARROW ROADS ON WEDNESDAY."

"THERE IS NO HARDSHIP, I SUPPOSE, NOTHING UNPLEASANT," SAID EDMUND, "IN
GOING ON THE BAROUCHE BOX."

"UNPLEASANT!" CRIED MARIA: "OH DEAR! I BELIEVE IT WOULD BE GENERALLY
THOUGHT THE FAVOURITE SEAT. THERE CAN BE NO COMPARISON AS TO ONE'S VIEW
OF THE COUNTRY. PROBABLY MISS CRAWFORD WILL CHOOSE THE BAROUCHE-BOX
HERSELF."

"THERE CAN BE NO OBJECTION, THEN, TO FANNY'S GOING WITH YOU; THERE CAN
BE NO DOUBT OF YOUR HAVING ROOM FOR HER."

"FANNY!" REPEATED MRS. NORRIS; "MY DEAR EDMUND, THERE IS NO IDEA OF HER
GOING WITH US. SHE STAYS WITH HER AUNT. I TOLD MRS. RUSHWORTH SO. SHE IS
NOT EXPECTED."

"YOU CAN HAVE NO REASON, I IMAGINE, MADAM," SAID HE, ADDRESSING HIS
MOTHER, "FOR WISHING FANNY NOT TO BE OF THE PARTY, BUT AS IT RELATES
TO YOURSELF, TO YOUR OWN COMFORT. IF YOU COULD DO WITHOUT HER, YOU WOULD
NOT WISH TO KEEP HER AT HOME?"

"TO BE SURE NOT, BUT I CANNOT DO WITHOUT HER."

"YOU CAN, IF I STAY AT HOME WITH YOU, AS I MEAN TO DO."

THERE WAS A GENERAL CRY OUT AT THIS. "YES," HE CONTINUED, "THERE IS NO
NECESSITY FOR MY GOING, AND I MEAN TO STAY AT HOME. FANNY HAS A GREAT
DESIRE TO SEE SOTHERTON. I KNOW SHE WISHES IT VERY MUCH. SHE HAS NOT
OFTEN A GRATIFICATION OF THE KIND, AND I AM SURE, MA'AM, YOU WOULD BE
GLAD TO GIVE HER THE PLEASURE NOW?"

"OH YES! VERY GLAD, IF YOUR AUNT SEES NO OBJECTION."

MRS. NORRIS WAS VERY READY WITH THE ONLY OBJECTION WHICH COULD
REMAIN--THEIR HAVING POSITIVELY ASSURED MRS. RUSHWORTH THAT FANNY COULD
NOT GO, AND THE VERY STRANGE APPEARANCE THERE WOULD CONSEQUENTLY BE IN
TAKING HER, WHICH SEEMED TO HER A DIFFICULTY QUITE IMPOSSIBLE TO BE GOT
OVER. IT MUST HAVE THE STRANGEST APPEARANCE! IT WOULD BE SOMETHING SO
VERY UNCEREMONIOUS, SO BORDERING ON DISRESPECT FOR MRS. RUSHWORTH, WHOSE
OWN MANNERS WERE SUCH A PATTERN OF GOOD-BREEDING AND ATTENTION, THAT SHE
REALLY DID NOT FEEL EQUAL TO IT. MRS. NORRIS HAD NO AFFECTION FOR FANNY,
AND NO WISH OF PROCURING HER PLEASURE AT ANY TIME; BUT HER OPPOSITION TO
EDMUND NOW, AROSE MORE FROM PARTIALITY FOR HER OWN SCHEME, BECAUSE IT
WAS HER OWN, THAN FROM ANYTHING ELSE. SHE FELT THAT SHE HAD ARRANGED
EVERYTHING EXTREMELY WELL, AND THAT ANY ALTERATION MUST BE FOR THE
WORSE. WHEN EDMUND, THEREFORE, TOLD HER IN REPLY, AS HE DID WHEN SHE
WOULD GIVE HIM THE HEARING, THAT SHE NEED NOT DISTRESS HERSELF ON MRS.
RUSHWORTH'S ACCOUNT, BECAUSE HE HAD TAKEN THE OPPORTUNITY, AS HE WALKED
WITH HER THROUGH THE HALL, OF MENTIONING MISS PRICE AS ONE WHO WOULD
PROBABLY BE OF THE PARTY, AND HAD DIRECTLY RECEIVED A VERY SUFFICIENT
INVITATION FOR HIS COUSIN, MRS. NORRIS WAS TOO MUCH VEXED TO SUBMIT WITH
A VERY GOOD GRACE, AND WOULD ONLY SAY, "VERY WELL, VERY WELL, JUST AS
YOU CHUSE, SETTLE IT YOUR OWN WAY, I AM SURE I DO NOT CARE ABOUT IT."

"IT SEEMS VERY ODD," SAID MARIA, "THAT YOU SHOULD BE STAYING AT HOME
INSTEAD OF FANNY."

"I AM SURE SHE OUGHT TO BE VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU," ADDED JULIA,
HASTILY LEAVING THE ROOM AS SHE SPOKE, FROM A CONSCIOUSNESS THAT SHE
OUGHT TO OFFER TO STAY AT HOME HERSELF.

"FANNY WILL FEEL QUITE AS GRATEFUL AS THE OCCASION REQUIRES," WAS
EDMUND'S ONLY REPLY, AND THE SUBJECT DROPT.

FANNY'S GRATITUDE, WHEN SHE HEARD THE PLAN, WAS, IN FACT, MUCH GREATER
THAN HER PLEASURE. SHE FELT EDMUND'S KINDNESS WITH ALL, AND MORE THAN
ALL, THE SENSIBILITY WHICH HE, UNSUSPICIOUS OF HER FOND ATTACHMENT,
COULD BE AWARE OF; BUT THAT HE SHOULD FOREGO ANY ENJOYMENT ON HER
ACCOUNT GAVE HER PAIN, AND HER OWN SATISFACTION IN SEEING SOTHERTON
WOULD BE NOTHING WITHOUT HIM.

THE NEXT MEETING OF THE TWO MANSFIELD FAMILIES PRODUCED ANOTHER
ALTERATION IN THE PLAN, AND ONE THAT WAS ADMITTED WITH GENERAL
APPROBATION. MRS. GRANT OFFERED HERSELF AS COMPANION FOR THE DAY TO LADY
BERTRAM IN LIEU OF HER SON, AND DR. GRANT WAS TO JOIN THEM AT DINNER.
LADY BERTRAM WAS VERY WELL PLEASED TO HAVE IT SO, AND THE YOUNG LADIES
WERE IN SPIRITS AGAIN. EVEN EDMUND WAS VERY THANKFUL FOR AN ARRANGEMENT
WHICH RESTORED HIM TO HIS SHARE OF THE PARTY; AND MRS. NORRIS THOUGHT IT
AN EXCELLENT PLAN, AND HAD IT AT HER TONGUE'S END, AND WAS ON THE POINT
OF PROPOSING IT, WHEN MRS. GRANT SPOKE.

WEDNESDAY WAS FINE, AND SOON AFTER BREAKFAST THE BAROUCHE ARRIVED, MR.
CRAWFORD DRIVING HIS SISTERS; AND AS EVERYBODY WAS READY, THERE WAS
NOTHING TO BE DONE BUT FOR MRS. GRANT TO ALIGHT AND THE OTHERS TO TAKE
THEIR PLACES. THE PLACE OF ALL PLACES, THE ENVIED SEAT, THE POST OF
HONOUR, WAS UNAPPROPRIATED. TO WHOSE HAPPY LOT WAS IT TO FALL? WHILE
EACH OF THE MISS BERTRAMS WERE MEDITATING HOW BEST, AND WITH THE MOST
APPEARANCE OF OBLIGING THE OTHERS, TO SECURE IT, THE MATTER WAS SETTLED
BY MRS. GRANT'S SAYING, AS SHE STEPPED FROM THE CARRIAGE, "AS THERE ARE
FIVE OF YOU, IT WILL BE BETTER THAT ONE SHOULD SIT WITH HENRY; AND AS
YOU WERE SAYING LATELY THAT YOU WISHED YOU COULD DRIVE, JULIA, I THINK
THIS WILL BE A GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU TO TAKE A LESSON."

HAPPY JULIA! UNHAPPY MARIA! THE FORMER WAS ON THE BAROUCHE-BOX IN A
MOMENT, THE LATTER TOOK HER SEAT WITHIN, IN GLOOM AND MORTIFICATION; AND
THE CARRIAGE DROVE OFF AMID THE GOOD WISHES OF THE TWO REMAINING LADIES,
AND THE BARKING OF PUG IN HIS MISTRESS'S ARMS.

THEIR ROAD WAS THROUGH A PLEASANT COUNTRY; AND FANNY, WHOSE RIDES HAD
NEVER BEEN EXTENSIVE, WAS SOON BEYOND HER KNOWLEDGE, AND WAS VERY HAPPY
IN OBSERVING ALL THAT WAS NEW, AND ADMIRING ALL THAT WAS PRETTY. SHE WAS
NOT OFTEN INVITED TO JOIN IN THE CONVERSATION OF THE OTHERS, NOR DID
SHE DESIRE IT. HER OWN THOUGHTS AND REFLECTIONS WERE HABITUALLY HER
BEST COMPANIONS; AND, IN OBSERVING THE APPEARANCE OF THE COUNTRY, THE
BEARINGS OF THE ROADS, THE DIFFERENCE OF SOIL, THE STATE OF THE HARVEST,
THE COTTAGES, THE CATTLE, THE CHILDREN, SHE FOUND ENTERTAINMENT THAT
COULD ONLY HAVE BEEN HEIGHTENED BY HAVING EDMUND TO SPEAK TO OF WHAT SHE
FELT. THAT WAS THE ONLY POINT OF RESEMBLANCE BETWEEN HER AND THE LADY
WHO SAT BY HER: IN EVERYTHING BUT A VALUE FOR EDMUND, MISS CRAWFORD WAS
VERY UNLIKE HER. SHE HAD NONE OF FANNY'S DELICACY OF TASTE, OF MIND, OF
FEELING; SHE SAW NATURE, INANIMATE NATURE, WITH LITTLE OBSERVATION;
HER ATTENTION WAS ALL FOR MEN AND WOMEN, HER TALENTS FOR THE LIGHT
AND LIVELY. IN LOOKING BACK AFTER EDMUND, HOWEVER, WHEN THERE WAS ANY
STRETCH OF ROAD BEHIND THEM, OR WHEN HE GAINED ON THEM IN ASCENDING A
CONSIDERABLE HILL, THEY WERE UNITED, AND A "THERE HE IS" BROKE AT THE
SAME MOMENT FROM THEM BOTH, MORE THAN ONCE.

FOR THE FIRST SEVEN MILES MISS BERTRAM HAD VERY LITTLE REAL COMFORT:
HER PROSPECT ALWAYS ENDED IN MR. CRAWFORD AND HER SISTER SITTING SIDE BY
SIDE, FULL OF CONVERSATION AND MERRIMENT; AND TO SEE ONLY HIS EXPRESSIVE
PROFILE AS HE TURNED WITH A SMILE TO JULIA, OR TO CATCH THE LAUGH OF
THE OTHER, WAS A PERPETUAL SOURCE OF IRRITATION, WHICH HER OWN SENSE
OF PROPRIETY COULD BUT JUST SMOOTH OVER. WHEN JULIA LOOKED BACK, IT WAS
WITH A COUNTENANCE OF DELIGHT, AND WHENEVER SHE SPOKE TO THEM, IT WAS IN
THE HIGHEST SPIRITS: "HER VIEW OF THE COUNTRY WAS CHARMING, SHE WISHED
THEY COULD ALL SEE IT," ETC.; BUT HER ONLY OFFER OF EXCHANGE WAS
ADDRESSED TO MISS CRAWFORD, AS THEY GAINED THE SUMMIT OF A LONG HILL,
AND WAS NOT MORE INVITING THAN THIS: "HERE IS A FINE BURST OF COUNTRY. I
WISH YOU HAD MY SEAT, BUT I DARE SAY YOU WILL NOT TAKE IT, LET ME PRESS
YOU EVER SO MUCH;" AND MISS CRAWFORD COULD HARDLY ANSWER BEFORE THEY
WERE MOVING AGAIN AT A GOOD PACE.

WHEN THEY CAME WITHIN THE INFLUENCE OF SOTHERTON ASSOCIATIONS, IT WAS
BETTER FOR MISS BERTRAM, WHO MIGHT BE SAID TO HAVE TWO STRINGS TO HER
BOW. SHE HAD RUSHWORTH FEELINGS, AND CRAWFORD FEELINGS, AND IN
THE VICINITY OF SOTHERTON THE FORMER HAD CONSIDERABLE EFFECT. MR.
RUSHWORTH'S CONSEQUENCE WAS HERS. SHE COULD NOT TELL MISS CRAWFORD THAT
"THOSE WOODS BELONGED TO SOTHERTON," SHE COULD NOT CARELESSLY OBSERVE
THAT "SHE BELIEVED THAT IT WAS NOW ALL MR. RUSHWORTH'S PROPERTY ON EACH
SIDE OF THE ROAD," WITHOUT ELATION OF HEART; AND IT WAS A PLEASURE
TO INCREASE WITH THEIR APPROACH TO THE CAPITAL FREEHOLD MANSION,
AND ANCIENT MANORIAL RESIDENCE OF THE FAMILY, WITH ALL ITS RIGHTS OF
COURT-LEET AND COURT-BARON.

"NOW WE SHALL HAVE NO MORE ROUGH ROAD, MISS CRAWFORD; OUR DIFFICULTIES
ARE OVER. THE REST OF THE WAY IS SUCH AS IT OUGHT TO BE. MR. RUSHWORTH
HAS MADE IT SINCE HE SUCCEEDED TO THE ESTATE. HERE BEGINS THE VILLAGE.
THOSE COTTAGES ARE REALLY A DISGRACE. THE CHURCH SPIRE IS RECKONED
REMARKABLY HANDSOME. I AM GLAD THE CHURCH IS NOT SO CLOSE TO THE GREAT
HOUSE AS OFTEN HAPPENS IN OLD PLACES. THE ANNOYANCE OF THE BELLS MUST BE
TERRIBLE. THERE IS THE PARSONAGE: A TIDY-LOOKING HOUSE, AND I UNDERSTAND
THE CLERGYMAN AND HIS WIFE ARE VERY DECENT PEOPLE. THOSE ARE ALMSHOUSES,
BUILT BY SOME OF THE FAMILY. TO THE RIGHT IS THE STEWARD'S HOUSE; HE
IS A VERY RESPECTABLE MAN. NOW WE ARE COMING TO THE LODGE-GATES; BUT WE
HAVE NEARLY A MILE THROUGH THE PARK STILL. IT IS NOT UGLY, YOU SEE, AT
THIS END; THERE IS SOME FINE TIMBER, BUT THE SITUATION OF THE HOUSE IS
DREADFUL. WE GO DOWN HILL TO IT FOR HALF A MILE, AND IT IS A PITY, FOR
IT WOULD NOT BE AN ILL-LOOKING PLACE IF IT HAD A BETTER APPROACH."

MISS CRAWFORD WAS NOT SLOW TO ADMIRE; SHE PRETTY WELL GUESSED MISS
BERTRAM'S FEELINGS, AND MADE IT A POINT OF HONOUR TO PROMOTE HER
ENJOYMENT TO THE UTMOST. MRS. NORRIS WAS ALL DELIGHT AND VOLUBILITY; AND
EVEN FANNY HAD SOMETHING TO SAY IN ADMIRATION, AND MIGHT BE HEARD WITH
COMPLACENCY. HER EYE WAS EAGERLY TAKING IN EVERYTHING WITHIN HER REACH;
AND AFTER BEING AT SOME PAINS TO GET A VIEW OF THE HOUSE, AND OBSERVING
THAT "IT WAS A SORT OF BUILDING WHICH SHE COULD NOT LOOK AT BUT WITH
RESPECT," SHE ADDED, "NOW, WHERE IS THE AVENUE? THE HOUSE FRONTS THE
EAST, I PERCEIVE. THE AVENUE, THEREFORE, MUST BE AT THE BACK OF IT. MR.
RUSHWORTH TALKED OF THE WEST FRONT."

"YES, IT IS EXACTLY BEHIND THE HOUSE; BEGINS AT A LITTLE DISTANCE, AND
ASCENDS FOR HALF A MILE TO THE EXTREMITY OF THE GROUNDS. YOU MAY SEE
SOMETHING OF IT HERE--SOMETHING OF THE MORE DISTANT TREES. IT IS OAK
ENTIRELY."

MISS BERTRAM COULD NOW SPEAK WITH DECIDED INFORMATION OF WHAT SHE HAD
KNOWN NOTHING ABOUT WHEN MR. RUSHWORTH HAD ASKED HER OPINION; AND HER
SPIRITS WERE IN AS HAPPY A FLUTTER AS VANITY AND PRIDE COULD FURNISH,
WHEN THEY DROVE UP TO THE SPACIOUS STONE STEPS BEFORE THE PRINCIPAL
ENTRANCE.



CHAPTER IX

MR. RUSHWORTH WAS AT THE DOOR TO RECEIVE HIS FAIR LADY; AND THE WHOLE
PARTY WERE WELCOMED BY HIM WITH DUE ATTENTION. IN THE DRAWING-ROOM THEY
WERE MET WITH EQUAL CORDIALITY BY THE MOTHER, AND MISS BERTRAM HAD ALL
THE DISTINCTION WITH EACH THAT SHE COULD WISH. AFTER THE BUSINESS OF
ARRIVING WAS OVER, IT WAS FIRST NECESSARY TO EAT, AND THE DOORS WERE
THROWN OPEN TO ADMIT THEM THROUGH ONE OR TWO INTERMEDIATE ROOMS INTO THE
APPOINTED DINING-PARLOUR, WHERE A COLLATION WAS PREPARED WITH ABUNDANCE
AND ELEGANCE. MUCH WAS SAID, AND MUCH WAS ATE, AND ALL WENT WELL. THE
PARTICULAR OBJECT OF THE DAY WAS THEN CONSIDERED. HOW WOULD MR. CRAWFORD
LIKE, IN WHAT MANNER WOULD HE CHUSE, TO TAKE A SURVEY OF THE GROUNDS?
MR. RUSHWORTH MENTIONED HIS CURRICLE. MR. CRAWFORD SUGGESTED THE GREATER
DESIRABLENESS OF SOME CARRIAGE WHICH MIGHT CONVEY MORE THAN TWO. "TO BE
DEPRIVING THEMSELVES OF THE ADVANTAGE OF OTHER EYES AND OTHER JUDGMENTS,
MIGHT BE AN EVIL EVEN BEYOND THE LOSS OF PRESENT PLEASURE."

MRS. RUSHWORTH PROPOSED THAT THE CHAISE SHOULD BE TAKEN ALSO; BUT THIS
WAS SCARCELY RECEIVED AS AN AMENDMENT: THE YOUNG LADIES NEITHER SMILED
NOR SPOKE. HER NEXT PROPOSITION, OF SHEWING THE HOUSE TO SUCH OF THEM
AS HAD NOT BEEN THERE BEFORE, WAS MORE ACCEPTABLE, FOR MISS BERTRAM
WAS PLEASED TO HAVE ITS SIZE DISPLAYED, AND ALL WERE GLAD TO BE DOING
SOMETHING.

THE WHOLE PARTY ROSE ACCORDINGLY, AND UNDER MRS. RUSHWORTH'S GUIDANCE
WERE SHEWN THROUGH A NUMBER OF ROOMS, ALL LOFTY, AND MANY LARGE, AND
AMPLY FURNISHED IN THE TASTE OF FIFTY YEARS BACK, WITH SHINING FLOORS,
SOLID MAHOGANY, RICH DAMASK, MARBLE, GILDING, AND CARVING, EACH HANDSOME
IN ITS WAY. OF PICTURES THERE WERE ABUNDANCE, AND SOME FEW GOOD, BUT
THE LARGER PART WERE FAMILY PORTRAITS, NO LONGER ANYTHING TO ANYBODY
BUT MRS. RUSHWORTH, WHO HAD BEEN AT GREAT PAINS TO LEARN ALL THAT THE
HOUSEKEEPER COULD TEACH, AND WAS NOW ALMOST EQUALLY WELL QUALIFIED TO
SHEW THE HOUSE. ON THE PRESENT OCCASION SHE ADDRESSED HERSELF CHIEFLY TO
MISS CRAWFORD AND FANNY, BUT THERE WAS NO COMPARISON IN THE WILLINGNESS
OF THEIR ATTENTION; FOR MISS CRAWFORD, WHO HAD SEEN SCORES OF GREAT
HOUSES, AND CARED FOR NONE OF THEM, HAD ONLY THE APPEARANCE OF CIVILLY
LISTENING, WHILE FANNY, TO WHOM EVERYTHING WAS ALMOST AS INTERESTING
AS IT WAS NEW, ATTENDED WITH UNAFFECTED EARNESTNESS TO ALL THAT MRS.
RUSHWORTH COULD RELATE OF THE FAMILY IN FORMER TIMES, ITS RISE AND
GRANDEUR, REGAL VISITS AND LOYAL EFFORTS, DELIGHTED TO CONNECT ANYTHING
WITH HISTORY ALREADY KNOWN, OR WARM HER IMAGINATION WITH SCENES OF THE
PAST.

THE SITUATION OF THE HOUSE EXCLUDED THE POSSIBILITY OF MUCH PROSPECT
FROM ANY OF THE ROOMS; AND WHILE FANNY AND SOME OF THE OTHERS WERE
ATTENDING MRS. RUSHWORTH, HENRY CRAWFORD WAS LOOKING GRAVE AND SHAKING
HIS HEAD AT THE WINDOWS. EVERY ROOM ON THE WEST FRONT LOOKED ACROSS
A LAWN TO THE BEGINNING OF THE AVENUE IMMEDIATELY BEYOND TALL IRON
PALISADES AND GATES.

HAVING VISITED MANY MORE ROOMS THAN COULD BE SUPPOSED TO BE OF ANY
OTHER USE THAN TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE WINDOW-TAX, AND FIND EMPLOYMENT FOR
HOUSEMAIDS, "NOW," SAID MRS. RUSHWORTH, "WE ARE COMING TO THE CHAPEL,
WHICH PROPERLY WE OUGHT TO ENTER FROM ABOVE, AND LOOK DOWN UPON; BUT
AS WE ARE QUITE AMONG FRIENDS, I WILL TAKE YOU IN THIS WAY, IF YOU WILL
EXCUSE ME."

THEY ENTERED. FANNY'S IMAGINATION HAD PREPARED HER FOR SOMETHING
GRANDER THAN A MERE SPACIOUS, OBLONG ROOM, FITTED UP FOR THE PURPOSE OF
DEVOTION: WITH NOTHING MORE STRIKING OR MORE SOLEMN THAN THE PROFUSION
OF MAHOGANY, AND THE CRIMSON VELVET CUSHIONS APPEARING OVER THE LEDGE OF
THE FAMILY GALLERY ABOVE. "I AM DISAPPOINTED," SAID SHE, IN A LOW VOICE,
TO EDMUND. "THIS IS NOT MY IDEA OF A CHAPEL. THERE IS NOTHING AWFUL
HERE, NOTHING MELANCHOLY, NOTHING GRAND. HERE ARE NO AISLES, NO ARCHES,
NO INSCRIPTIONS, NO BANNERS. NO BANNERS, COUSIN, TO BE 'BLOWN BY THE
NIGHT WIND OF HEAVEN.' NO SIGNS THAT A 'SCOTTISH MONARCH SLEEPS BELOW.'"

"YOU FORGET, FANNY, HOW LATELY ALL THIS HAS BEEN BUILT, AND FOR HOW
CONFINED A PURPOSE, COMPARED WITH THE OLD CHAPELS OF CASTLES AND
MONASTERIES. IT WAS ONLY FOR THE PRIVATE USE OF THE FAMILY. THEY HAVE
BEEN BURIED, I SUPPOSE, IN THE PARISH CHURCH. THERE YOU MUST LOOK FOR
THE BANNERS AND THE ACHIEVEMENTS."

"IT WAS FOOLISH OF ME NOT TO THINK OF ALL THAT; BUT I AM DISAPPOINTED."

MRS. RUSHWORTH BEGAN HER RELATION. "THIS CHAPEL WAS FITTED UP AS YOU SEE
IT, IN JAMES THE SECOND'S TIME. BEFORE THAT PERIOD, AS I UNDERSTAND,
THE PEWS WERE ONLY WAINSCOT; AND THERE IS SOME REASON TO THINK THAT
THE LININGS AND CUSHIONS OF THE PULPIT AND FAMILY SEAT WERE ONLY PURPLE
CLOTH; BUT THIS IS NOT QUITE CERTAIN. IT IS A HANDSOME CHAPEL, AND WAS
FORMERLY IN CONSTANT USE BOTH MORNING AND EVENING. PRAYERS WERE ALWAYS
READ IN IT BY THE DOMESTIC CHAPLAIN, WITHIN THE MEMORY OF MANY; BUT THE
LATE MR. RUSHWORTH LEFT IT OFF."

"EVERY GENERATION HAS ITS IMPROVEMENTS," SAID MISS CRAWFORD, WITH A
SMILE, TO EDMUND.

MRS. RUSHWORTH WAS GONE TO REPEAT HER LESSON TO MR. CRAWFORD; AND
EDMUND, FANNY, AND MISS CRAWFORD REMAINED IN A CLUSTER TOGETHER.

"IT IS A PITY," CRIED FANNY, "THAT THE CUSTOM SHOULD HAVE BEEN
DISCONTINUED. IT WAS A VALUABLE PART OF FORMER TIMES. THERE IS SOMETHING
IN A CHAPEL AND CHAPLAIN SO MUCH IN CHARACTER WITH A GREAT HOUSE,
WITH ONE'S IDEAS OF WHAT SUCH A HOUSEHOLD SHOULD BE! A WHOLE FAMILY
ASSEMBLING REGULARLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF PRAYER IS FINE!"

"VERY FINE INDEED," SAID MISS CRAWFORD, LAUGHING. "IT MUST DO THE HEADS
OF THE FAMILY A GREAT DEAL OF GOOD TO FORCE ALL THE POOR HOUSEMAIDS AND
FOOTMEN TO LEAVE BUSINESS AND PLEASURE, AND SAY THEIR PRAYERS HERE TWICE
A DAY, WHILE THEY ARE INVENTING EXCUSES THEMSELVES FOR STAYING AWAY."

"THAT IS HARDLY FANNY'S IDEA OF A FAMILY ASSEMBLING," SAID EDMUND. "IF
THE MASTER AND MISTRESS DO NOT ATTEND THEMSELVES, THERE MUST BE MORE
HARM THAN GOOD IN THE CUSTOM."

"AT ANY RATE, IT IS SAFER TO LEAVE PEOPLE TO THEIR OWN DEVICES ON SUCH
SUBJECTS. EVERYBODY LIKES TO GO THEIR OWN WAY--TO CHUSE THEIR OWN TIME
AND MANNER OF DEVOTION. THE OBLIGATION OF ATTENDANCE, THE FORMALITY, THE
RESTRAINT, THE LENGTH OF TIME--ALTOGETHER IT IS A FORMIDABLE THING, AND
WHAT NOBODY LIKES; AND IF THE GOOD PEOPLE WHO USED TO KNEEL AND GAPE IN
THAT GALLERY COULD HAVE FORESEEN THAT THE TIME WOULD EVER COME WHEN MEN
AND WOMEN MIGHT LIE ANOTHER TEN MINUTES IN BED, WHEN THEY WOKE WITH A
HEADACHE, WITHOUT DANGER OF REPROBATION, BECAUSE CHAPEL WAS MISSED,
THEY WOULD HAVE JUMPED WITH JOY AND ENVY. CANNOT YOU IMAGINE WITH WHAT
UNWILLING FEELINGS THE FORMER BELLES OF THE HOUSE OF RUSHWORTH DID
MANY A TIME REPAIR TO THIS CHAPEL? THE YOUNG MRS. ELEANORS AND MRS.
BRIDGETS--STARCHED UP INTO SEEMING PIETY, BUT WITH HEADS FULL OF
SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT--ESPECIALLY IF THE POOR CHAPLAIN WERE NOT WORTH
LOOKING AT--AND, IN THOSE DAYS, I FANCY PARSONS WERE VERY INFERIOR EVEN
TO WHAT THEY ARE NOW."

FOR A FEW MOMENTS SHE WAS UNANSWERED. FANNY COLOURED AND LOOKED
AT EDMUND, BUT FELT TOO ANGRY FOR SPEECH; AND HE NEEDED A LITTLE
RECOLLECTION BEFORE HE COULD SAY, "YOUR LIVELY MIND CAN HARDLY BE
SERIOUS EVEN ON SERIOUS SUBJECTS. YOU HAVE GIVEN US AN AMUSING SKETCH,
AND HUMAN NATURE CANNOT SAY IT WAS NOT SO. WE MUST ALL FEEL AT TIMES
THE DIFFICULTY OF FIXING OUR THOUGHTS AS WE COULD WISH; BUT IF YOU ARE
SUPPOSING IT A FREQUENT THING, THAT IS TO SAY, A WEAKNESS GROWN INTO A
HABIT FROM NEGLECT, WHAT COULD BE EXPECTED FROM THE PRIVATE DEVOTIONS
OF SUCH PERSONS? DO YOU THINK THE MINDS WHICH ARE SUFFERED, WHICH
ARE INDULGED IN WANDERINGS IN A CHAPEL, WOULD BE MORE COLLECTED IN A
CLOSET?"

"YES, VERY LIKELY. THEY WOULD HAVE TWO CHANCES AT LEAST IN THEIR FAVOUR.
THERE WOULD BE LESS TO DISTRACT THE ATTENTION FROM WITHOUT, AND IT WOULD
NOT BE TRIED SO LONG."

"THE MIND WHICH DOES NOT STRUGGLE AGAINST ITSELF UNDER ONE
CIRCUMSTANCE, WOULD FIND OBJECTS TO DISTRACT IT IN THE OTHER, I
BELIEVE; AND THE INFLUENCE OF THE PLACE AND OF EXAMPLE MAY OFTEN ROUSE
BETTER FEELINGS THAN ARE BEGUN WITH. THE GREATER LENGTH OF THE SERVICE,
HOWEVER, I ADMIT TO BE SOMETIMES TOO HARD A STRETCH UPON THE MIND. ONE
WISHES IT WERE NOT SO; BUT I HAVE NOT YET LEFT OXFORD LONG ENOUGH TO
FORGET WHAT CHAPEL PRAYERS ARE."

WHILE THIS WAS PASSING, THE REST OF THE PARTY BEING SCATTERED ABOUT THE
CHAPEL, JULIA CALLED MR. CRAWFORD'S ATTENTION TO HER SISTER, BY SAYING,
"DO LOOK AT MR. RUSHWORTH AND MARIA, STANDING SIDE BY SIDE, EXACTLY AS
IF THE CEREMONY WERE GOING TO BE PERFORMED. HAVE NOT THEY COMPLETELY THE
AIR OF IT?"

MR. CRAWFORD SMILED HIS ACQUIESCENCE, AND STEPPING FORWARD TO MARIA,
SAID, IN A VOICE WHICH SHE ONLY COULD HEAR, "I DO NOT LIKE TO SEE MISS
BERTRAM SO NEAR THE ALTAR."

STARTING, THE LADY INSTINCTIVELY MOVED A STEP OR TWO, BUT RECOVERING
HERSELF IN A MOMENT, AFFECTED TO LAUGH, AND ASKED HIM, IN A TONE NOT
MUCH LOUDER, "IF HE WOULD GIVE HER AWAY?"

"I AM AFRAID I SHOULD DO IT VERY AWKWARDLY," WAS HIS REPLY, WITH A LOOK
OF MEANING.

JULIA, JOINING THEM AT THE MOMENT, CARRIED ON THE JOKE.

"UPON MY WORD, IT IS REALLY A PITY THAT IT SHOULD NOT TAKE PLACE
DIRECTLY, IF WE HAD BUT A PROPER LICENCE, FOR HERE WE ARE ALTOGETHER,
AND NOTHING IN THE WORLD COULD BE MORE SNUG AND PLEASANT." AND SHE
TALKED AND LAUGHED ABOUT IT WITH SO LITTLE CAUTION AS TO CATCH THE
COMPREHENSION OF MR. RUSHWORTH AND HIS MOTHER, AND EXPOSE HER SISTER TO
THE WHISPERED GALLANTRIES OF HER LOVER, WHILE MRS. RUSHWORTH SPOKE
WITH PROPER SMILES AND DIGNITY OF ITS BEING A MOST HAPPY EVENT TO HER
WHENEVER IT TOOK PLACE.

"IF EDMUND WERE BUT IN ORDERS!" CRIED JULIA, AND RUNNING TO WHERE HE
STOOD WITH MISS CRAWFORD AND FANNY: "MY DEAR EDMUND, IF YOU WERE BUT IN
ORDERS NOW, YOU MIGHT PERFORM THE CEREMONY DIRECTLY. HOW UNLUCKY THAT
YOU ARE NOT ORDAINED; MR. RUSHWORTH AND MARIA ARE QUITE READY."

MISS CRAWFORD'S COUNTENANCE, AS JULIA SPOKE, MIGHT HAVE AMUSED A
DISINTERESTED OBSERVER. SHE LOOKED ALMOST AGHAST UNDER THE NEW IDEA SHE
WAS RECEIVING. FANNY PITIED HER. "HOW DISTRESSED SHE WILL BE AT WHAT SHE
SAID JUST NOW," PASSED ACROSS HER MIND.

"ORDAINED!" SAID MISS CRAWFORD; "WHAT, ARE YOU TO BE A CLERGYMAN?"

"YES; I SHALL TAKE ORDERS SOON AFTER MY FATHER'S RETURN--PROBABLY AT
CHRISTMAS."

MISS CRAWFORD, RALLYING HER SPIRITS, AND RECOVERING HER COMPLEXION,
REPLIED ONLY, "IF I HAD KNOWN THIS BEFORE, I WOULD HAVE SPOKEN OF THE
CLOTH WITH MORE RESPECT," AND TURNED THE SUBJECT.

THE CHAPEL WAS SOON AFTERWARDS LEFT TO THE SILENCE AND STILLNESS
WHICH REIGNED IN IT, WITH FEW INTERRUPTIONS, THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. MISS
BERTRAM, DISPLEASED WITH HER SISTER, LED THE WAY, AND ALL SEEMED TO FEEL
THAT THEY HAD BEEN THERE LONG ENOUGH.

THE LOWER PART OF THE HOUSE HAD BEEN NOW ENTIRELY SHEWN, AND MRS.
RUSHWORTH, NEVER WEARY IN THE CAUSE, WOULD HAVE PROCEEDED TOWARDS THE
PRINCIPAL STAIRCASE, AND TAKEN THEM THROUGH ALL THE ROOMS ABOVE, IF HER
SON HAD NOT INTERPOSED WITH A DOUBT OF THERE BEING TIME ENOUGH. "FOR
IF," SAID HE, WITH THE SORT OF SELF-EVIDENT PROPOSITION WHICH MANY A
CLEARER HEAD DOES NOT ALWAYS AVOID, "WE ARE TOO LONG GOING OVER THE
HOUSE, WE SHALL NOT HAVE TIME FOR WHAT IS TO BE DONE OUT OF DOORS. IT IS
PAST TWO, AND WE ARE TO DINE AT FIVE."

MRS. RUSHWORTH SUBMITTED; AND THE QUESTION OF SURVEYING THE GROUNDS,
WITH THE WHO AND THE HOW, WAS LIKELY TO BE MORE FULLY AGITATED, AND MRS.
NORRIS WAS BEGINNING TO ARRANGE BY WHAT JUNCTION OF CARRIAGES AND HORSES
MOST COULD BE DONE, WHEN THE YOUNG PEOPLE, MEETING WITH AN OUTWARD DOOR,
TEMPTINGLY OPEN ON A FLIGHT OF STEPS WHICH LED IMMEDIATELY TO TURF AND
SHRUBS, AND ALL THE SWEETS OF PLEASURE-GROUNDS, AS BY ONE IMPULSE, ONE
WISH FOR AIR AND LIBERTY, ALL WALKED OUT.

"SUPPOSE WE TURN DOWN HERE FOR THE PRESENT," SAID MRS. RUSHWORTH,
CIVILLY TAKING THE HINT AND FOLLOWING THEM. "HERE ARE THE GREATEST
NUMBER OF OUR PLANTS, AND HERE ARE THE CURIOUS PHEASANTS."

"QUERY," SAID MR. CRAWFORD, LOOKING ROUND HIM, "WHETHER WE MAY NOT FIND
SOMETHING TO EMPLOY US HERE BEFORE WE GO FARTHER? I SEE WALLS OF GREAT
PROMISE. MR. RUSHWORTH, SHALL WE SUMMON A COUNCIL ON THIS LAWN?"

"JAMES," SAID MRS. RUSHWORTH TO HER SON, "I BELIEVE THE WILDERNESS
WILL BE NEW TO ALL THE PARTY. THE MISS BERTRAMS HAVE NEVER SEEN THE
WILDERNESS YET."

NO OBJECTION WAS MADE, BUT FOR SOME TIME THERE SEEMED NO INCLINATION TO
MOVE IN ANY PLAN, OR TO ANY DISTANCE. ALL WERE ATTRACTED AT FIRST BY THE
PLANTS OR THE PHEASANTS, AND ALL DISPERSED ABOUT IN HAPPY INDEPENDENCE.
MR. CRAWFORD WAS THE FIRST TO MOVE FORWARD TO EXAMINE THE CAPABILITIES
OF THAT END OF THE HOUSE. THE LAWN, BOUNDED ON EACH SIDE BY A HIGH WALL,
CONTAINED BEYOND THE FIRST PLANTED AREA A BOWLING-GREEN, AND BEYOND
THE BOWLING-GREEN A LONG TERRACE WALK, BACKED BY IRON PALISADES, AND
COMMANDING A VIEW OVER THEM INTO THE TOPS OF THE TREES OF THE WILDERNESS
IMMEDIATELY ADJOINING. IT WAS A GOOD SPOT FOR FAULT-FINDING. MR.
CRAWFORD WAS SOON FOLLOWED BY MISS BERTRAM AND MR. RUSHWORTH; AND WHEN,
AFTER A LITTLE TIME, THE OTHERS BEGAN TO FORM INTO PARTIES, THESE THREE
WERE FOUND IN BUSY CONSULTATION ON THE TERRACE BY EDMUND, MISS CRAWFORD,
AND FANNY, WHO SEEMED AS NATURALLY TO UNITE, AND WHO, AFTER A SHORT
PARTICIPATION OF THEIR REGRETS AND DIFFICULTIES, LEFT THEM AND WALKED
ON. THE REMAINING THREE, MRS. RUSHWORTH, MRS. NORRIS, AND JULIA, WERE
STILL FAR BEHIND; FOR JULIA, WHOSE HAPPY STAR NO LONGER PREVAILED,
WAS OBLIGED TO KEEP BY THE SIDE OF MRS. RUSHWORTH, AND RESTRAIN HER
IMPATIENT FEET TO THAT LADY'S SLOW PACE, WHILE HER AUNT, HAVING FALLEN
IN WITH THE HOUSEKEEPER, WHO WAS COME OUT TO FEED THE PHEASANTS, WAS
LINGERING BEHIND IN GOSSIP WITH HER. POOR JULIA, THE ONLY ONE OUT OF
THE NINE NOT TOLERABLY SATISFIED WITH THEIR LOT, WAS NOW IN A STATE OF
COMPLETE PENANCE, AND AS DIFFERENT FROM THE JULIA OF THE BAROUCHE-BOX AS
COULD WELL BE IMAGINED. THE POLITENESS WHICH SHE HAD BEEN BROUGHT UP TO
PRACTISE AS A DUTY MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR HER TO ESCAPE; WHILE THE
WANT OF THAT HIGHER SPECIES OF SELF-COMMAND, THAT JUST CONSIDERATION OF
OTHERS, THAT KNOWLEDGE OF HER OWN HEART, THAT PRINCIPLE OF RIGHT, WHICH
HAD NOT FORMED ANY ESSENTIAL PART OF HER EDUCATION, MADE HER MISERABLE
UNDER IT.

"THIS IS INSUFFERABLY HOT," SAID MISS CRAWFORD, WHEN THEY HAD TAKEN ONE
TURN ON THE TERRACE, AND WERE DRAWING A SECOND TIME TO THE DOOR IN THE
MIDDLE WHICH OPENED TO THE WILDERNESS. "SHALL ANY OF US OBJECT TO BEING
COMFORTABLE? HERE IS A NICE LITTLE WOOD, IF ONE CAN BUT GET INTO IT.
WHAT HAPPINESS IF THE DOOR SHOULD NOT BE LOCKED! BUT OF COURSE IT IS;
FOR IN THESE GREAT PLACES THE GARDENERS ARE THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO CAN GO
WHERE THEY LIKE."

THE DOOR, HOWEVER, PROVED NOT TO BE LOCKED, AND THEY WERE ALL AGREED IN
TURNING JOYFULLY THROUGH IT, AND LEAVING THE UNMITIGATED GLARE OF DAY
BEHIND. A CONSIDERABLE FLIGHT OF STEPS LANDED THEM IN THE WILDERNESS,
WHICH WAS A PLANTED WOOD OF ABOUT TWO ACRES, AND THOUGH CHIEFLY OF
LARCH AND LAUREL, AND BEECH CUT DOWN, AND THOUGH LAID OUT WITH TOO MUCH
REGULARITY, WAS DARKNESS AND SHADE, AND NATURAL BEAUTY, COMPARED WITH
THE BOWLING-GREEN AND THE TERRACE. THEY ALL FELT THE REFRESHMENT OF IT,
AND FOR SOME TIME COULD ONLY WALK AND ADMIRE. AT LENGTH, AFTER A SHORT
PAUSE, MISS CRAWFORD BEGAN WITH, "SO YOU ARE TO BE A CLERGYMAN, MR.
BERTRAM. THIS IS RATHER A SURPRISE TO ME."

"WHY SHOULD IT SURPRISE YOU? YOU MUST SUPPOSE ME DESIGNED FOR SOME
PROFESSION, AND MIGHT PERCEIVE THAT I AM NEITHER A LAWYER, NOR A
SOLDIER, NOR A SAILOR."

"VERY TRUE; BUT, IN SHORT, IT HAD NOT OCCURRED TO ME. AND YOU KNOW THERE
IS GENERALLY AN UNCLE OR A GRANDFATHER TO LEAVE A FORTUNE TO THE SECOND
SON."

"A VERY PRAISEWORTHY PRACTICE," SAID EDMUND, "BUT NOT QUITE UNIVERSAL.
I AM ONE OF THE EXCEPTIONS, AND BEING ONE, MUST DO SOMETHING FOR
MYSELF."

"BUT WHY ARE YOU TO BE A CLERGYMAN? I THOUGHT THAT WAS ALWAYS THE LOT
OF THE YOUNGEST, WHERE THERE WERE MANY TO CHUSE BEFORE HIM."

"DO YOU THINK THE CHURCH ITSELF NEVER CHOSEN, THEN?"

"NEVER IS A BLACK WORD. BUT YES, IN THE NEVER OF CONVERSATION, WHICH
MEANS NOT VERY OFTEN, I DO THINK IT. FOR WHAT IS TO BE DONE IN THE
CHURCH? MEN LOVE TO DISTINGUISH THEMSELVES, AND IN EITHER OF THE OTHER
LINES DISTINCTION MAY BE GAINED, BUT NOT IN THE CHURCH. A CLERGYMAN IS
NOTHING."

"THE NOTHING OF CONVERSATION HAS ITS GRADATIONS, I HOPE, AS WELL AS
THE NEVER. A CLERGYMAN CANNOT BE HIGH IN STATE OR FASHION. HE MUST
NOT HEAD MOBS, OR SET THE TON IN DRESS. BUT I CANNOT CALL THAT SITUATION
NOTHING WHICH HAS THE CHARGE OF ALL THAT IS OF THE FIRST IMPORTANCE
TO MANKIND, INDIVIDUALLY OR COLLECTIVELY CONSIDERED, TEMPORALLY AND
ETERNALLY, WHICH HAS THE GUARDIANSHIP OF RELIGION AND MORALS, AND
CONSEQUENTLY OF THE MANNERS WHICH RESULT FROM THEIR INFLUENCE. NO ONE
HERE CAN CALL THE OFFICE NOTHING. IF THE MAN WHO HOLDS IT IS SO, IT
IS BY THE NEGLECT OF HIS DUTY, BY FOREGOING ITS JUST IMPORTANCE, AND
STEPPING OUT OF HIS PLACE TO APPEAR WHAT HE OUGHT NOT TO APPEAR."

"YOU ASSIGN GREATER CONSEQUENCE TO THE CLERGYMAN THAN ONE HAS BEEN
USED TO HEAR GIVEN, OR THAN I CAN QUITE COMPREHEND. ONE DOES NOT SEE
MUCH OF THIS INFLUENCE AND IMPORTANCE IN SOCIETY, AND HOW CAN IT BE
ACQUIRED WHERE THEY ARE SO SELDOM SEEN THEMSELVES? HOW CAN TWO SERMONS A
WEEK, EVEN SUPPOSING THEM WORTH HEARING, SUPPOSING THE PREACHER TO HAVE
THE SENSE TO PREFER BLAIR'S TO HIS OWN, DO ALL THAT YOU SPEAK OF? GOVERN
THE CONDUCT AND FASHION THE MANNERS OF A LARGE CONGREGATION FOR THE REST
OF THE WEEK? ONE SCARCELY SEES A CLERGYMAN OUT OF HIS PULPIT."

"YOU ARE SPEAKING OF LONDON, I AM SPEAKING OF THE NATION AT LARGE."

"THE METROPOLIS, I IMAGINE, IS A PRETTY FAIR SAMPLE OF THE REST."

"NOT, I SHOULD HOPE, OF THE PROPORTION OF VIRTUE TO VICE THROUGHOUT THE
KINGDOM. WE DO NOT LOOK IN GREAT CITIES FOR OUR BEST MORALITY. IT IS NOT
THERE THAT RESPECTABLE PEOPLE OF ANY DENOMINATION CAN DO MOST GOOD; AND
IT CERTAINLY IS NOT THERE THAT THE INFLUENCE OF THE CLERGY CAN BE MOST
FELT. A FINE PREACHER IS FOLLOWED AND ADMIRED; BUT IT IS NOT IN FINE
PREACHING ONLY THAT A GOOD CLERGYMAN WILL BE USEFUL IN HIS PARISH AND
HIS NEIGHBOURHOOD, WHERE THE PARISH AND NEIGHBOURHOOD ARE OF A SIZE
CAPABLE OF KNOWING HIS PRIVATE CHARACTER, AND OBSERVING HIS GENERAL
CONDUCT, WHICH IN LONDON CAN RARELY BE THE CASE. THE CLERGY ARE LOST
THERE IN THE CROWDS OF THEIR PARISHIONERS. THEY ARE KNOWN TO THE LARGEST
PART ONLY AS PREACHERS. AND WITH REGARD TO THEIR INFLUENCING PUBLIC
MANNERS, MISS CRAWFORD MUST NOT MISUNDERSTAND ME, OR SUPPOSE I MEAN TO
CALL THEM THE ARBITERS OF GOOD-BREEDING, THE REGULATORS OF REFINEMENT
AND COURTESY, THE MASTERS OF THE CEREMONIES OF LIFE. THE MANNERS I
SPEAK OF MIGHT RATHER BE CALLED CONDUCT, PERHAPS, THE RESULT OF GOOD
PRINCIPLES; THE EFFECT, IN SHORT, OF THOSE DOCTRINES WHICH IT IS THEIR
DUTY TO TEACH AND RECOMMEND; AND IT WILL, I BELIEVE, BE EVERYWHERE
FOUND, THAT AS THE CLERGY ARE, OR ARE NOT WHAT THEY OUGHT TO BE, SO ARE
THE REST OF THE NATION."

"CERTAINLY," SAID FANNY, WITH GENTLE EARNESTNESS.

"THERE," CRIED MISS CRAWFORD, "YOU HAVE QUITE CONVINCED MISS PRICE
ALREADY."

"I WISH I COULD CONVINCE MISS CRAWFORD TOO."

"I DO NOT THINK YOU EVER WILL," SAID SHE, WITH AN ARCH SMILE; "I AM JUST
AS MUCH SURPRISED NOW AS I WAS AT FIRST THAT YOU SHOULD INTEND TO TAKE
ORDERS. YOU REALLY ARE FIT FOR SOMETHING BETTER. COME, DO CHANGE YOUR
MIND. IT IS NOT TOO LATE. GO INTO THE LAW."

"GO INTO THE LAW! WITH AS MUCH EASE AS I WAS TOLD TO GO INTO THIS
WILDERNESS."

"NOW YOU ARE GOING TO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT LAW BEING THE WORST WILDERNESS
OF THE TWO, BUT I FORESTALL YOU; REMEMBER, I HAVE FORESTALLED YOU."

"YOU NEED NOT HURRY WHEN THE OBJECT IS ONLY TO PREVENT MY SAYING A
BON MOT, FOR THERE IS NOT THE LEAST WIT IN MY NATURE. I AM A VERY
MATTER-OF-FACT, PLAIN-SPOKEN BEING, AND MAY BLUNDER ON THE BORDERS OF A
REPARTEE FOR HALF AN HOUR TOGETHER WITHOUT STRIKING IT OUT."

A GENERAL SILENCE SUCCEEDED. EACH WAS THOUGHTFUL. FANNY MADE THE FIRST
INTERRUPTION BY SAYING, "I WONDER THAT I SHOULD BE TIRED WITH ONLY
WALKING IN THIS SWEET WOOD; BUT THE NEXT TIME WE COME TO A SEAT, IF IT
IS NOT DISAGREEABLE TO YOU, I SHOULD BE GLAD TO SIT DOWN FOR A LITTLE
WHILE."

"MY DEAR FANNY," CRIED EDMUND, IMMEDIATELY DRAWING HER ARM WITHIN HIS,
"HOW THOUGHTLESS I HAVE BEEN! I HOPE YOU ARE NOT VERY TIRED. PERHAPS,"
TURNING TO MISS CRAWFORD, "MY OTHER COMPANION MAY DO ME THE HONOUR OF
TAKING AN ARM."

"THANK YOU, BUT I AM NOT AT ALL TIRED." SHE TOOK IT, HOWEVER, AS SHE
SPOKE, AND THE GRATIFICATION OF HAVING HER DO SO, OF FEELING SUCH A
CONNEXION FOR THE FIRST TIME, MADE HIM A LITTLE FORGETFUL OF FANNY.
"YOU SCARCELY TOUCH ME," SAID HE. "YOU DO NOT MAKE ME OF ANY USE. WHAT A
DIFFERENCE IN THE WEIGHT OF A WOMAN'S ARM FROM THAT OF A MAN! AT OXFORD
I HAVE BEEN A GOOD DEAL USED TO HAVE A MAN LEAN ON ME FOR THE LENGTH OF
A STREET, AND YOU ARE ONLY A FLY IN THE COMPARISON."

"I AM REALLY NOT TIRED, WHICH I ALMOST WONDER AT; FOR WE MUST HAVE
WALKED AT LEAST A MILE IN THIS WOOD. DO NOT YOU THINK WE HAVE?"

"NOT HALF A MILE," WAS HIS STURDY ANSWER; FOR HE WAS NOT YET SO MUCH IN
LOVE AS TO MEASURE DISTANCE, OR RECKON TIME, WITH FEMININE LAWLESSNESS.

"OH! YOU DO NOT CONSIDER HOW MUCH WE HAVE WOUND ABOUT. WE HAVE TAKEN
SUCH A VERY SERPENTINE COURSE, AND THE WOOD ITSELF MUST BE HALF A MILE
LONG IN A STRAIGHT LINE, FOR WE HAVE NEVER SEEN THE END OF IT YET SINCE
WE LEFT THE FIRST GREAT PATH."

"BUT IF YOU REMEMBER, BEFORE WE LEFT THAT FIRST GREAT PATH, WE SAW
DIRECTLY TO THE END OF IT. WE LOOKED DOWN THE WHOLE VISTA, AND SAW IT
CLOSED BY IRON GATES, AND IT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE THAN A FURLONG IN
LENGTH."

"OH! I KNOW NOTHING OF YOUR FURLONGS, BUT I AM SURE IT IS A VERY LONG
WOOD, AND THAT WE HAVE BEEN WINDING IN AND OUT EVER SINCE WE CAME INTO
IT; AND THEREFORE, WHEN I SAY THAT WE HAVE WALKED A MILE IN IT, I MUST
SPEAK WITHIN COMPASS."

"WE HAVE BEEN EXACTLY A QUARTER OF AN HOUR HERE," SAID EDMUND, TAKING
OUT HIS WATCH. "DO YOU THINK WE ARE WALKING FOUR MILES AN HOUR?"

"OH! DO NOT ATTACK ME WITH YOUR WATCH. A WATCH IS ALWAYS TOO FAST OR TOO
SLOW. I CANNOT BE DICTATED TO BY A WATCH."

A FEW STEPS FARTHER BROUGHT THEM OUT AT THE BOTTOM OF THE VERY WALK THEY
HAD BEEN TALKING OF; AND STANDING BACK, WELL SHADED AND SHELTERED, AND
LOOKING OVER A HA-HA INTO THE PARK, WAS A COMFORTABLE-SIZED BENCH, ON
WHICH THEY ALL SAT DOWN.

"I AM AFRAID YOU ARE VERY TIRED, FANNY," SAID EDMUND, OBSERVING HER;
"WHY WOULD NOT YOU SPEAK SOONER? THIS WILL BE A BAD DAY'S AMUSEMENT FOR
YOU IF YOU ARE TO BE KNOCKED UP. EVERY SORT OF EXERCISE FATIGUES HER SO
SOON, MISS CRAWFORD, EXCEPT RIDING."

"HOW ABOMINABLE IN YOU, THEN, TO LET ME ENGROSS HER HORSE AS I DID ALL
LAST WEEK! I AM ASHAMED OF YOU AND OF MYSELF, BUT IT SHALL NEVER HAPPEN
AGAIN."

"YOUR ATTENTIVENESS AND CONSIDERATION MAKES ME MORE SENSIBLE OF MY OWN
NEGLECT. FANNY'S INTEREST SEEMS IN SAFER HANDS WITH YOU THAN WITH ME."

"THAT SHE SHOULD BE TIRED NOW, HOWEVER, GIVES ME NO SURPRISE; FOR THERE
IS NOTHING IN THE COURSE OF ONE'S DUTIES SO FATIGUING AS WHAT WE HAVE
BEEN DOING THIS MORNING: SEEING A GREAT HOUSE, DAWDLING FROM ONE ROOM TO
ANOTHER, STRAINING ONE'S EYES AND ONE'S ATTENTION, HEARING WHAT ONE DOES
NOT UNDERSTAND, ADMIRING WHAT ONE DOES NOT CARE FOR. IT IS GENERALLY
ALLOWED TO BE THE GREATEST BORE IN THE WORLD, AND MISS PRICE HAS FOUND
IT SO, THOUGH SHE DID NOT KNOW IT."

"I SHALL SOON BE RESTED," SAID FANNY; "TO SIT IN THE SHADE ON A FINE
DAY, AND LOOK UPON VERDURE, IS THE MOST PERFECT REFRESHMENT."

AFTER SITTING A LITTLE WHILE MISS CRAWFORD WAS UP AGAIN. "I MUST MOVE,"
SAID SHE; "RESTING FATIGUES ME. I HAVE LOOKED ACROSS THE HA-HA TILL I
AM WEARY. I MUST GO AND LOOK THROUGH THAT IRON GATE AT THE SAME VIEW,
WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO SEE IT SO WELL."

EDMUND LEFT THE SEAT LIKEWISE. "NOW, MISS CRAWFORD, IF YOU WILL LOOK UP
THE WALK, YOU WILL CONVINCE YOURSELF THAT IT CANNOT BE HALF A MILE LONG,
OR HALF HALF A MILE."

"IT IS AN IMMENSE DISTANCE," SAID SHE; "I SEE THAT WITH A GLANCE."

HE STILL REASONED WITH HER, BUT IN VAIN. SHE WOULD NOT CALCULATE, SHE
WOULD NOT COMPARE. SHE WOULD ONLY SMILE AND ASSERT. THE GREATEST DEGREE
OF RATIONAL CONSISTENCY COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE ENGAGING, AND THEY
TALKED WITH MUTUAL SATISFACTION. AT LAST IT WAS AGREED THAT THEY SHOULD
ENDEAVOUR TO DETERMINE THE DIMENSIONS OF THE WOOD BY WALKING A LITTLE
MORE ABOUT IT. THEY WOULD GO TO ONE END OF IT, IN THE LINE THEY WERE
THEN IN--FOR THERE WAS A STRAIGHT GREEN WALK ALONG THE BOTTOM BY
THE SIDE OF THE HA-HA--AND PERHAPS TURN A LITTLE WAY IN SOME OTHER
DIRECTION, IF IT SEEMED LIKELY TO ASSIST THEM, AND BE BACK IN A FEW
MINUTES. FANNY SAID SHE WAS RESTED, AND WOULD HAVE MOVED TOO, BUT THIS
WAS NOT SUFFERED. EDMUND URGED HER REMAINING WHERE SHE WAS WITH AN
EARNESTNESS WHICH SHE COULD NOT RESIST, AND SHE WAS LEFT ON THE BENCH TO
THINK WITH PLEASURE OF HER COUSIN'S CARE, BUT WITH GREAT REGRET THAT SHE
WAS NOT STRONGER. SHE WATCHED THEM TILL THEY HAD TURNED THE CORNER, AND
LISTENED TILL ALL SOUND OF THEM HAD CEASED.



CHAPTER X

A QUARTER OF AN HOUR, TWENTY MINUTES, PASSED AWAY, AND FANNY WAS STILL
THINKING OF EDMUND, MISS CRAWFORD, AND HERSELF, WITHOUT INTERRUPTION
FROM ANY ONE. SHE BEGAN TO BE SURPRISED AT BEING LEFT SO LONG, AND TO
LISTEN WITH AN ANXIOUS DESIRE OF HEARING THEIR STEPS AND THEIR VOICES
AGAIN. SHE LISTENED, AND AT LENGTH SHE HEARD; SHE HEARD VOICES AND FEET
APPROACHING; BUT SHE HAD JUST SATISFIED HERSELF THAT IT WAS NOT THOSE
SHE WANTED, WHEN MISS BERTRAM, MR. RUSHWORTH, AND MR. CRAWFORD ISSUED
FROM THE SAME PATH WHICH SHE HAD TROD HERSELF, AND WERE BEFORE HER.

"MISS PRICE ALL ALONE" AND "MY DEAR FANNY, HOW COMES THIS?" WERE THE
FIRST SALUTATIONS. SHE TOLD HER STORY. "POOR DEAR FANNY," CRIED HER
COUSIN, "HOW ILL YOU HAVE BEEN USED BY THEM! YOU HAD BETTER HAVE STAID
WITH US."

THEN SEATING HERSELF WITH A GENTLEMAN ON EACH SIDE, SHE RESUMED
THE CONVERSATION WHICH HAD ENGAGED THEM BEFORE, AND DISCUSSED THE
POSSIBILITY OF IMPROVEMENTS WITH MUCH ANIMATION. NOTHING WAS FIXED
ON; BUT HENRY CRAWFORD WAS FULL OF IDEAS AND PROJECTS, AND, GENERALLY
SPEAKING, WHATEVER HE PROPOSED WAS IMMEDIATELY APPROVED, FIRST BY HER,
AND THEN BY MR. RUSHWORTH, WHOSE PRINCIPAL BUSINESS SEEMED TO BE TO
HEAR THE OTHERS, AND WHO SCARCELY RISKED AN ORIGINAL THOUGHT OF HIS OWN
BEYOND A WISH THAT THEY HAD SEEN HIS FRIEND SMITH'S PLACE.

AFTER SOME MINUTES SPENT IN THIS WAY, MISS BERTRAM, OBSERVING THE IRON
GATE, EXPRESSED A WISH OF PASSING THROUGH IT INTO THE PARK, THAT THEIR
VIEWS AND THEIR PLANS MIGHT BE MORE COMPREHENSIVE. IT WAS THE VERY THING
OF ALL OTHERS TO BE WISHED, IT WAS THE BEST, IT WAS THE ONLY WAY OF
PROCEEDING WITH ANY ADVANTAGE, IN HENRY CRAWFORD'S OPINION; AND HE
DIRECTLY SAW A KNOLL NOT HALF A MILE OFF, WHICH WOULD GIVE THEM EXACTLY
THE REQUISITE COMMAND OF THE HOUSE. GO THEREFORE THEY MUST TO THAT
KNOLL, AND THROUGH THAT GATE; BUT THE GATE WAS LOCKED. MR. RUSHWORTH
WISHED HE HAD BROUGHT THE KEY; HE HAD BEEN VERY NEAR THINKING WHETHER HE
SHOULD NOT BRING THE KEY; HE WAS DETERMINED HE WOULD NEVER COME WITHOUT
THE KEY AGAIN; BUT STILL THIS DID NOT REMOVE THE PRESENT EVIL. THEY
COULD NOT GET THROUGH; AND AS MISS BERTRAM'S INCLINATION FOR SO DOING
DID BY NO MEANS LESSEN, IT ENDED IN MR. RUSHWORTH'S DECLARING OUTRIGHT
THAT HE WOULD GO AND FETCH THE KEY. HE SET OFF ACCORDINGLY.

"IT IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE BEST THING WE CAN DO NOW, AS WE ARE SO FAR FROM
THE HOUSE ALREADY," SAID MR. CRAWFORD, WHEN HE WAS GONE.

"YES, THERE IS NOTHING ELSE TO BE DONE. BUT NOW, SINCERELY, DO NOT YOU
FIND THE PLACE ALTOGETHER WORSE THAN YOU EXPECTED?"

"NO, INDEED, FAR OTHERWISE. I FIND IT BETTER, GRANDER, MORE COMPLETE IN
ITS STYLE, THOUGH THAT STYLE MAY NOT BE THE BEST. AND TO TELL YOU THE
TRUTH," SPEAKING RATHER LOWER, "I DO NOT THINK THAT I SHALL EVER SEE
SOTHERTON AGAIN WITH SO MUCH PLEASURE AS I DO NOW. ANOTHER SUMMER WILL
HARDLY IMPROVE IT TO ME."

AFTER A MOMENT'S EMBARRASSMENT THE LADY REPLIED, "YOU ARE TOO MUCH A
MAN OF THE WORLD NOT TO SEE WITH THE EYES OF THE WORLD. IF OTHER PEOPLE
THINK SOTHERTON IMPROVED, I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT YOU WILL."

"I AM AFRAID I AM NOT QUITE SO MUCH THE MAN OF THE WORLD AS MIGHT BE
GOOD FOR ME IN SOME POINTS. MY FEELINGS ARE NOT QUITE SO EVANESCENT, NOR
MY MEMORY OF THE PAST UNDER SUCH EASY DOMINION AS ONE FINDS TO BE THE
CASE WITH MEN OF THE WORLD."

THIS WAS FOLLOWED BY A SHORT SILENCE. MISS BERTRAM BEGAN AGAIN. "YOU
SEEMED TO ENJOY YOUR DRIVE HERE VERY MUCH THIS MORNING. I WAS GLAD TO
SEE YOU SO WELL ENTERTAINED. YOU AND JULIA WERE LAUGHING THE WHOLE WAY."

"WERE WE? YES, I BELIEVE WE WERE; BUT I HAVE NOT THE LEAST RECOLLECTION
AT WHAT. OH! I BELIEVE I WAS RELATING TO HER SOME RIDICULOUS STORIES OF
AN OLD IRISH GROOM OF MY UNCLE'S. YOUR SISTER LOVES TO LAUGH."

"YOU THINK HER MORE LIGHT-HEARTED THAN I AM?"

"MORE EASILY AMUSED," HE REPLIED; "CONSEQUENTLY, YOU KNOW," SMILING,
"BETTER COMPANY. I COULD NOT HAVE HOPED TO ENTERTAIN YOU WITH IRISH
ANECDOTES DURING A TEN MILES' DRIVE."

"NATURALLY, I BELIEVE, I AM AS LIVELY AS JULIA, BUT I HAVE MORE TO THINK
OF NOW."

"YOU HAVE, UNDOUBTEDLY; AND THERE ARE SITUATIONS IN WHICH VERY HIGH
SPIRITS WOULD DENOTE INSENSIBILITY. YOUR PROSPECTS, HOWEVER, ARE TOO
FAIR TO JUSTIFY WANT OF SPIRITS. YOU HAVE A VERY SMILING SCENE BEFORE
YOU."

"DO YOU MEAN LITERALLY OR FIGURATIVELY? LITERALLY, I CONCLUDE. YES,
CERTAINLY, THE SUN SHINES, AND THE PARK LOOKS VERY CHEERFUL. BUT
UNLUCKILY THAT IRON GATE, THAT HA-HA, GIVE ME A FEELING OF RESTRAINT AND
HARDSHIP. 'I CANNOT GET OUT,' AS THE STARLING SAID." AS SHE SPOKE, AND
IT WAS WITH EXPRESSION, SHE WALKED TO THE GATE: HE FOLLOWED HER. "MR.
RUSHWORTH IS SO LONG FETCHING THIS KEY!"

"AND FOR THE WORLD YOU WOULD NOT GET OUT WITHOUT THE KEY AND WITHOUT MR.
RUSHWORTH'S AUTHORITY AND PROTECTION, OR I THINK YOU MIGHT WITH LITTLE
DIFFICULTY PASS ROUND THE EDGE OF THE GATE, HERE, WITH MY ASSISTANCE;
I THINK IT MIGHT BE DONE, IF YOU REALLY WISHED TO BE MORE AT LARGE, AND
COULD ALLOW YOURSELF TO THINK IT NOT PROHIBITED."

"PROHIBITED! NONSENSE! I CERTAINLY CAN GET OUT THAT WAY, AND I WILL.
MR. RUSHWORTH WILL BE HERE IN A MOMENT, YOU KNOW; WE SHALL NOT BE OUT OF
SIGHT."

"OR IF WE ARE, MISS PRICE WILL BE SO GOOD AS TO TELL HIM THAT HE WILL
FIND US NEAR THAT KNOLL: THE GROVE OF OAK ON THE KNOLL."

FANNY, FEELING ALL THIS TO BE WRONG, COULD NOT HELP MAKING AN EFFORT TO
PREVENT IT. "YOU WILL HURT YOURSELF, MISS BERTRAM," SHE CRIED; "YOU WILL
CERTAINLY HURT YOURSELF AGAINST THOSE SPIKES; YOU WILL TEAR YOUR GOWN;
YOU WILL BE IN DANGER OF SLIPPING INTO THE HA-HA. YOU HAD BETTER NOT
GO."

HER COUSIN WAS SAFE ON THE OTHER SIDE WHILE THESE WORDS WERE SPOKEN,
AND, SMILING WITH ALL THE GOOD-HUMOUR OF SUCCESS, SHE SAID, "THANK YOU,
MY DEAR FANNY, BUT I AND MY GOWN ARE ALIVE AND WELL, AND SO GOOD-BYE."

FANNY WAS AGAIN LEFT TO HER SOLITUDE, AND WITH NO INCREASE OF PLEASANT
FEELINGS, FOR SHE WAS SORRY FOR ALMOST ALL THAT SHE HAD SEEN AND HEARD,
ASTONISHED AT MISS BERTRAM, AND ANGRY WITH MR. CRAWFORD. BY TAKING
A CIRCUITOUS ROUTE, AND, AS IT APPEARED TO HER, VERY UNREASONABLE
DIRECTION TO THE KNOLL, THEY WERE SOON BEYOND HER EYE; AND FOR SOME
MINUTES LONGER SHE REMAINED WITHOUT SIGHT OR SOUND OF ANY COMPANION.
SHE SEEMED TO HAVE THE LITTLE WOOD ALL TO HERSELF. SHE COULD ALMOST
HAVE THOUGHT THAT EDMUND AND MISS CRAWFORD HAD LEFT IT, BUT THAT IT WAS
IMPOSSIBLE FOR EDMUND TO FORGET HER SO ENTIRELY.

SHE WAS AGAIN ROUSED FROM DISAGREEABLE MUSINGS BY SUDDEN FOOTSTEPS:
SOMEBODY WAS COMING AT A QUICK PACE DOWN THE PRINCIPAL WALK. SHE
EXPECTED MR. RUSHWORTH, BUT IT WAS JULIA, WHO, HOT AND OUT OF BREATH,
AND WITH A LOOK OF DISAPPOINTMENT, CRIED OUT ON SEEING HER, "HEYDAY!
WHERE ARE THE OTHERS? I THOUGHT MARIA AND MR. CRAWFORD WERE WITH YOU."

FANNY EXPLAINED.

"A PRETTY TRICK, UPON MY WORD! I CANNOT SEE THEM ANYWHERE," LOOKING
EAGERLY INTO THE PARK. "BUT THEY CANNOT BE VERY FAR OFF, AND I THINK I
AM EQUAL TO AS MUCH AS MARIA, EVEN WITHOUT HELP."

"BUT, JULIA, MR. RUSHWORTH WILL BE HERE IN A MOMENT WITH THE KEY. DO
WAIT FOR MR. RUSHWORTH."

"NOT I, INDEED. I HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF THE FAMILY FOR ONE MORNING. WHY,
CHILD, I HAVE BUT THIS MOMENT ESCAPED FROM HIS HORRIBLE MOTHER. SUCH A
PENANCE AS I HAVE BEEN ENDURING, WHILE YOU WERE SITTING HERE SO COMPOSED
AND SO HAPPY! IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN AS WELL, PERHAPS, IF YOU HAD BEEN IN MY
PLACE, BUT YOU ALWAYS CONTRIVE TO KEEP OUT OF THESE SCRAPES."

THIS WAS A MOST UNJUST REFLECTION, BUT FANNY COULD ALLOW FOR IT, AND LET
IT PASS: JULIA WAS VEXED, AND HER TEMPER WAS HASTY; BUT SHE FELT THAT IT
WOULD NOT LAST, AND THEREFORE, TAKING NO NOTICE, ONLY ASKED HER IF SHE
HAD NOT SEEN MR. RUSHWORTH.

"YES, YES, WE SAW HIM. HE WAS POSTING AWAY AS IF UPON LIFE AND DEATH,
AND COULD BUT JUST SPARE TIME TO TELL US HIS ERRAND, AND WHERE YOU ALL
WERE."

"IT IS A PITY HE SHOULD HAVE SO MUCH TROUBLE FOR NOTHING."

"THAT IS MISS MARIA'S CONCERN. I AM NOT OBLIGED TO PUNISH MYSELF FOR
HER SINS. THE MOTHER I COULD NOT AVOID, AS LONG AS MY TIRESOME AUNT
WAS DANCING ABOUT WITH THE HOUSEKEEPER, BUT THE SON I CAN GET AWAY
FROM."

AND SHE IMMEDIATELY SCRAMBLED ACROSS THE FENCE, AND WALKED AWAY, NOT
ATTENDING TO FANNY'S LAST QUESTION OF WHETHER SHE HAD SEEN ANYTHING OF
MISS CRAWFORD AND EDMUND. THE SORT OF DREAD IN WHICH FANNY NOW SAT OF
SEEING MR. RUSHWORTH PREVENTED HER THINKING SO MUCH OF THEIR CONTINUED
ABSENCE, HOWEVER, AS SHE MIGHT HAVE DONE. SHE FELT THAT HE HAD BEEN
VERY ILL-USED, AND WAS QUITE UNHAPPY IN HAVING TO COMMUNICATE WHAT HAD
PASSED. HE JOINED HER WITHIN FIVE MINUTES AFTER JULIA'S EXIT; AND
THOUGH SHE MADE THE BEST OF THE STORY, HE WAS EVIDENTLY MORTIFIED AND
DISPLEASED IN NO COMMON DEGREE. AT FIRST HE SCARCELY SAID ANYTHING; HIS
LOOKS ONLY EXPRESSED HIS EXTREME SURPRISE AND VEXATION, AND HE WALKED TO
THE GATE AND STOOD THERE, WITHOUT SEEMING TO KNOW WHAT TO DO.

"THEY DESIRED ME TO STAY--MY COUSIN MARIA CHARGED ME TO SAY THAT YOU
WOULD FIND THEM AT THAT KNOLL, OR THEREABOUTS."

"I DO NOT BELIEVE I SHALL GO ANY FARTHER," SAID HE SULLENLY; "I SEE
NOTHING OF THEM. BY THE TIME I GET TO THE KNOLL THEY MAY BE GONE
SOMEWHERE ELSE. I HAVE HAD WALKING ENOUGH."

AND HE SAT DOWN WITH A MOST GLOOMY COUNTENANCE BY FANNY.

"I AM VERY SORRY," SAID SHE; "IT IS VERY UNLUCKY." AND SHE LONGED TO BE
ABLE TO SAY SOMETHING MORE TO THE PURPOSE.

AFTER AN INTERVAL OF SILENCE, "I THINK THEY MIGHT AS WELL HAVE STAID FOR
ME," SAID HE.

"MISS BERTRAM THOUGHT YOU WOULD FOLLOW HER."

"I SHOULD NOT HAVE HAD TO FOLLOW HER IF SHE HAD STAID."

THIS COULD NOT BE DENIED, AND FANNY WAS SILENCED. AFTER ANOTHER PAUSE,
HE WENT ON--"PRAY, MISS PRICE, ARE YOU SUCH A GREAT ADMIRER OF THIS MR.
CRAWFORD AS SOME PEOPLE ARE? FOR MY PART, I CAN SEE NOTHING IN HIM."

"I DO NOT THINK HIM AT ALL HANDSOME."

"HANDSOME! NOBODY CAN CALL SUCH AN UNDERSIZED MAN HANDSOME. HE IS NOT
FIVE FOOT NINE. I SHOULD NOT WONDER IF HE IS NOT MORE THAN FIVE FOOT
EIGHT. I THINK HE IS AN ILL-LOOKING FELLOW. IN MY OPINION, THESE
CRAWFORDS ARE NO ADDITION AT ALL. WE DID VERY WELL WITHOUT THEM."

A SMALL SIGH ESCAPED FANNY HERE, AND SHE DID NOT KNOW HOW TO CONTRADICT
HIM.

"IF I HAD MADE ANY DIFFICULTY ABOUT FETCHING THE KEY, THERE MIGHT HAVE
BEEN SOME EXCUSE, BUT I WENT THE VERY MOMENT SHE SAID SHE WANTED IT."

"NOTHING COULD BE MORE OBLIGING THAN YOUR MANNER, I AM SURE, AND I DARE
SAY YOU WALKED AS FAST AS YOU COULD; BUT STILL IT IS SOME DISTANCE, YOU
KNOW, FROM THIS SPOT TO THE HOUSE, QUITE INTO THE HOUSE; AND WHEN PEOPLE
ARE WAITING, THEY ARE BAD JUDGES OF TIME, AND EVERY HALF MINUTE SEEMS
LIKE FIVE."

HE GOT UP AND WALKED TO THE GATE AGAIN, AND "WISHED HE HAD HAD THE KEY
ABOUT HIM AT THE TIME." FANNY THOUGHT SHE DISCERNED IN HIS STANDING
THERE AN INDICATION OF RELENTING, WHICH ENCOURAGED HER TO ANOTHER
ATTEMPT, AND SHE SAID, THEREFORE, "IT IS A PITY YOU SHOULD NOT JOIN
THEM. THEY EXPECTED TO HAVE A BETTER VIEW OF THE HOUSE FROM THAT PART
OF THE PARK, AND WILL BE THINKING HOW IT MAY BE IMPROVED; AND NOTHING OF
THAT SORT, YOU KNOW, CAN BE SETTLED WITHOUT YOU."

SHE FOUND HERSELF MORE SUCCESSFUL IN SENDING AWAY THAN IN RETAINING A
COMPANION. MR. RUSHWORTH WAS WORKED ON. "WELL," SAID HE, "IF YOU
REALLY THINK I HAD BETTER GO: IT WOULD BE FOOLISH TO BRING THE KEY
FOR NOTHING." AND LETTING HIMSELF OUT, HE WALKED OFF WITHOUT FARTHER
CEREMONY.

FANNY'S THOUGHTS WERE NOW ALL ENGROSSED BY THE TWO WHO HAD LEFT HER SO
LONG AGO, AND GETTING QUITE IMPATIENT, SHE RESOLVED TO GO IN SEARCH
OF THEM. SHE FOLLOWED THEIR STEPS ALONG THE BOTTOM WALK, AND HAD JUST
TURNED UP INTO ANOTHER, WHEN THE VOICE AND THE LAUGH OF MISS CRAWFORD
ONCE MORE CAUGHT HER EAR; THE SOUND APPROACHED, AND A FEW MORE WINDINGS
BROUGHT THEM BEFORE HER. THEY WERE JUST RETURNED INTO THE WILDERNESS
FROM THE PARK, TO WHICH A SIDEGATE, NOT FASTENED, HAD TEMPTED THEM VERY
SOON AFTER THEIR LEAVING HER, AND THEY HAD BEEN ACROSS A PORTION OF THE
PARK INTO THE VERY AVENUE WHICH FANNY HAD BEEN HOPING THE WHOLE MORNING
TO REACH AT LAST, AND HAD BEEN SITTING DOWN UNDER ONE OF THE TREES. THIS
WAS THEIR HISTORY. IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THEY HAD BEEN SPENDING THEIR TIME
PLEASANTLY, AND WERE NOT AWARE OF THE LENGTH OF THEIR ABSENCE. FANNY'S
BEST CONSOLATION WAS IN BEING ASSURED THAT EDMUND HAD WISHED FOR HER
VERY MUCH, AND THAT HE SHOULD CERTAINLY HAVE COME BACK FOR HER, HAD SHE
NOT BEEN TIRED ALREADY; BUT THIS WAS NOT QUITE SUFFICIENT TO DO AWAY
WITH THE PAIN OF HAVING BEEN LEFT A WHOLE HOUR, WHEN HE HAD TALKED OF
ONLY A FEW MINUTES, NOR TO BANISH THE SORT OF CURIOSITY SHE FELT TO KNOW
WHAT THEY HAD BEEN CONVERSING ABOUT ALL THAT TIME; AND THE RESULT OF
THE WHOLE WAS TO HER DISAPPOINTMENT AND DEPRESSION, AS THEY PREPARED BY
GENERAL AGREEMENT TO RETURN TO THE HOUSE.

ON REACHING THE BOTTOM OF THE STEPS TO THE TERRACE, MRS. RUSHWORTH
AND MRS. NORRIS PRESENTED THEMSELVES AT THE TOP, JUST READY FOR THE
WILDERNESS, AT THE END OF AN HOUR AND A HALF FROM THEIR LEAVING THE
HOUSE. MRS. NORRIS HAD BEEN TOO WELL EMPLOYED TO MOVE FASTER. WHATEVER
CROSS-ACCIDENTS HAD OCCURRED TO INTERCEPT THE PLEASURES OF HER NIECES,
SHE HAD FOUND A MORNING OF COMPLETE ENJOYMENT; FOR THE HOUSEKEEPER,
AFTER A GREAT MANY COURTESIES ON THE SUBJECT OF PHEASANTS, HAD TAKEN HER
TO THE DAIRY, TOLD HER ALL ABOUT THEIR COWS, AND GIVEN HER THE RECEIPT
FOR A FAMOUS CREAM CHEESE; AND SINCE JULIA'S LEAVING THEM THEY HAD
BEEN MET BY THE GARDENER, WITH WHOM SHE HAD MADE A MOST SATISFACTORY
ACQUAINTANCE, FOR SHE HAD SET HIM RIGHT AS TO HIS GRANDSON'S ILLNESS,
CONVINCED HIM THAT IT WAS AN AGUE, AND PROMISED HIM A CHARM FOR IT; AND
HE, IN RETURN, HAD SHEWN HER ALL HIS CHOICEST NURSERY OF PLANTS, AND
ACTUALLY PRESENTED HER WITH A VERY CURIOUS SPECIMEN OF HEATH.

ON THIS RENCONTRE THEY ALL RETURNED TO THE HOUSE TOGETHER, THERE
TO LOUNGE AWAY THE TIME AS THEY COULD WITH SOFAS, AND CHIT-CHAT, AND
QUARTERLY REVIEWS, TILL THE RETURN OF THE OTHERS, AND THE ARRIVAL OF
DINNER. IT WAS LATE BEFORE THE MISS BERTRAMS AND THE TWO GENTLEMEN CAME
IN, AND THEIR RAMBLE DID NOT APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN MORE THAN PARTIALLY
AGREEABLE, OR AT ALL PRODUCTIVE OF ANYTHING USEFUL WITH REGARD TO THE
OBJECT OF THE DAY. BY THEIR OWN ACCOUNTS THEY HAD BEEN ALL WALKING AFTER
EACH OTHER, AND THE JUNCTION WHICH HAD TAKEN PLACE AT LAST SEEMED, TO
FANNY'S OBSERVATION, TO HAVE BEEN AS MUCH TOO LATE FOR RE-ESTABLISHING
HARMONY, AS IT CONFESSEDLY HAD BEEN FOR DETERMINING ON ANY ALTERATION.
SHE FELT, AS SHE LOOKED AT JULIA AND MR. RUSHWORTH, THAT HERS WAS NOT
THE ONLY DISSATISFIED BOSOM AMONGST THEM: THERE WAS GLOOM ON THE FACE OF
EACH. MR. CRAWFORD AND MISS BERTRAM WERE MUCH MORE GAY, AND SHE THOUGHT
THAT HE WAS TAKING PARTICULAR PAINS, DURING DINNER, TO DO AWAY ANY
LITTLE RESENTMENT OF THE OTHER TWO, AND RESTORE GENERAL GOOD-HUMOUR.

DINNER WAS SOON FOLLOWED BY TEA AND COFFEE, A TEN MILES' DRIVE HOME
ALLOWED NO WASTE OF HOURS; AND FROM THE TIME OF THEIR SITTING DOWN TO
TABLE, IT WAS A QUICK SUCCESSION OF BUSY NOTHINGS TILL THE CARRIAGE CAME
TO THE DOOR, AND MRS. NORRIS, HAVING FIDGETED ABOUT, AND OBTAINED A
FEW PHEASANTS' EGGS AND A CREAM CHEESE FROM THE HOUSEKEEPER, AND MADE
ABUNDANCE OF CIVIL SPEECHES TO MRS. RUSHWORTH, WAS READY TO LEAD THE
WAY. AT THE SAME MOMENT MR. CRAWFORD, APPROACHING JULIA, SAID, "I HOPE I
AM NOT TO LOSE MY COMPANION, UNLESS SHE IS AFRAID OF THE EVENING AIR
IN SO EXPOSED A SEAT." THE REQUEST HAD NOT BEEN FORESEEN, BUT WAS VERY
GRACIOUSLY RECEIVED, AND JULIA'S DAY WAS LIKELY TO END ALMOST AS WELL AS
IT BEGAN. MISS BERTRAM HAD MADE UP HER MIND TO SOMETHING DIFFERENT, AND
WAS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED; BUT HER CONVICTION OF BEING REALLY THE
ONE PREFERRED COMFORTED HER UNDER IT, AND ENABLED HER TO RECEIVE MR.
RUSHWORTH'S PARTING ATTENTIONS AS SHE OUGHT. HE WAS CERTAINLY BETTER
PLEASED TO HAND HER INTO THE BAROUCHE THAN TO ASSIST HER IN ASCENDING
THE BOX, AND HIS COMPLACENCY SEEMED CONFIRMED BY THE ARRANGEMENT.

"WELL, FANNY, THIS HAS BEEN A FINE DAY FOR YOU, UPON MY WORD," SAID
MRS. NORRIS, AS THEY DROVE THROUGH THE PARK. "NOTHING BUT PLEASURE FROM
BEGINNING TO END! I AM SURE YOU OUGHT TO BE VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO YOUR
AUNT BERTRAM AND ME FOR CONTRIVING TO LET YOU GO. A PRETTY GOOD DAY'S
AMUSEMENT YOU HAVE HAD!"

MARIA WAS JUST DISCONTENTED ENOUGH TO SAY DIRECTLY, "I THINK YOU HAVE
DONE PRETTY WELL YOURSELF, MA'AM. YOUR LAP SEEMS FULL OF GOOD THINGS,
AND HERE IS A BASKET OF SOMETHING BETWEEN US WHICH HAS BEEN KNOCKING MY
ELBOW UNMERCIFULLY."

"MY DEAR, IT IS ONLY A BEAUTIFUL LITTLE HEATH, WHICH THAT NICE OLD
GARDENER WOULD MAKE ME TAKE; BUT IF IT IS IN YOUR WAY, I WILL HAVE IT IN
MY LAP DIRECTLY. THERE, FANNY, YOU SHALL CARRY THAT PARCEL FOR ME; TAKE
GREAT CARE OF IT: DO NOT LET IT FALL; IT IS A CREAM CHEESE, JUST LIKE
THE EXCELLENT ONE WE HAD AT DINNER. NOTHING WOULD SATISFY THAT GOOD OLD
MRS. WHITAKER, BUT MY TAKING ONE OF THE CHEESES. I STOOD OUT AS LONG
AS I COULD, TILL THE TEARS ALMOST CAME INTO HER EYES, AND I KNEW IT WAS
JUST THE SORT THAT MY SISTER WOULD BE DELIGHTED WITH. THAT MRS. WHITAKER
IS A TREASURE! SHE WAS QUITE SHOCKED WHEN I ASKED HER WHETHER WINE WAS
ALLOWED AT THE SECOND TABLE, AND SHE HAS TURNED AWAY TWO HOUSEMAIDS FOR
WEARING WHITE GOWNS. TAKE CARE OF THE CHEESE, FANNY. NOW I CAN MANAGE
THE OTHER PARCEL AND THE BASKET VERY WELL."

"WHAT ELSE HAVE YOU BEEN SPUNGING?" SAID MARIA, HALF-PLEASED THAT
SOTHERTON SHOULD BE SO COMPLIMENTED.

"SPUNGING, MY DEAR! IT IS NOTHING BUT FOUR OF THOSE BEAUTIFUL PHEASANTS'
EGGS, WHICH MRS. WHITAKER WOULD QUITE FORCE UPON ME: SHE WOULD NOT TAKE
A DENIAL. SHE SAID IT MUST BE SUCH AN AMUSEMENT TO ME, AS SHE UNDERSTOOD
I LIVED QUITE ALONE, TO HAVE A FEW LIVING CREATURES OF THAT SORT; AND
SO TO BE SURE IT WILL. I SHALL GET THE DAIRYMAID TO SET THEM UNDER THE
FIRST SPARE HEN, AND IF THEY COME TO GOOD I CAN HAVE THEM MOVED TO MY
OWN HOUSE AND BORROW A COOP; AND IT WILL BE A GREAT DELIGHT TO ME IN
MY LONELY HOURS TO ATTEND TO THEM. AND IF I HAVE GOOD LUCK, YOUR MOTHER
SHALL HAVE SOME."

IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL EVENING, MILD AND STILL, AND THE DRIVE WAS AS
PLEASANT AS THE SERENITY OF NATURE COULD MAKE IT; BUT WHEN MRS. NORRIS
CEASED SPEAKING, IT WAS ALTOGETHER A SILENT DRIVE TO THOSE WITHIN. THEIR
SPIRITS WERE IN GENERAL EXHAUSTED; AND TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE DAY HAD
AFFORDED MOST PLEASURE OR PAIN, MIGHT OCCUPY THE MEDITATIONS OF ALMOST
ALL.



CHAPTER XI

THE DAY AT SOTHERTON, WITH ALL ITS IMPERFECTIONS, AFFORDED THE MISS
BERTRAMS MUCH MORE AGREEABLE FEELINGS THAN WERE DERIVED FROM THE LETTERS
FROM ANTIGUA, WHICH SOON AFTERWARDS REACHED MANSFIELD. IT WAS MUCH
PLEASANTER TO THINK OF HENRY CRAWFORD THAN OF THEIR FATHER; AND TO THINK
OF THEIR FATHER IN ENGLAND AGAIN WITHIN A CERTAIN PERIOD, WHICH THESE
LETTERS OBLIGED THEM TO DO, WAS A MOST UNWELCOME EXERCISE.

NOVEMBER WAS THE BLACK MONTH FIXED FOR HIS RETURN. SIR THOMAS WROTE OF
IT WITH AS MUCH DECISION AS EXPERIENCE AND ANXIETY COULD AUTHORISE. HIS
BUSINESS WAS SO NEARLY CONCLUDED AS TO JUSTIFY HIM IN PROPOSING TO TAKE
HIS PASSAGE IN THE SEPTEMBER PACKET, AND HE CONSEQUENTLY LOOKED FORWARD
WITH THE HOPE OF BEING WITH HIS BELOVED FAMILY AGAIN EARLY IN NOVEMBER.

MARIA WAS MORE TO BE PITIED THAN JULIA; FOR TO HER THE FATHER BROUGHT A
HUSBAND, AND THE RETURN OF THE FRIEND MOST SOLICITOUS FOR HER HAPPINESS
WOULD UNITE HER TO THE LOVER, ON WHOM SHE HAD CHOSEN THAT HAPPINESS
SHOULD DEPEND. IT WAS A GLOOMY PROSPECT, AND ALL SHE COULD DO WAS TO
THROW A MIST OVER IT, AND HOPE WHEN THE MIST CLEARED AWAY SHE SHOULD
SEE SOMETHING ELSE. IT WOULD HARDLY BE EARLY IN NOVEMBER, THERE
WERE GENERALLY DELAYS, A BAD PASSAGE OR SOMETHING; THAT FAVOURING
SOMETHING WHICH EVERYBODY WHO SHUTS THEIR EYES WHILE THEY LOOK, OR
THEIR UNDERSTANDINGS WHILE THEY REASON, FEELS THE COMFORT OF. IT WOULD
PROBABLY BE THE MIDDLE OF NOVEMBER AT LEAST; THE MIDDLE OF NOVEMBER
WAS THREE MONTHS OFF. THREE MONTHS COMPRISED THIRTEEN WEEKS. MUCH MIGHT
HAPPEN IN THIRTEEN WEEKS.

SIR THOMAS WOULD HAVE BEEN DEEPLY MORTIFIED BY A SUSPICION OF HALF THAT
HIS DAUGHTERS FELT ON THE SUBJECT OF HIS RETURN, AND WOULD HARDLY HAVE
FOUND CONSOLATION IN A KNOWLEDGE OF THE INTEREST IT EXCITED IN THE
BREAST OF ANOTHER YOUNG LADY. MISS CRAWFORD, ON WALKING UP WITH HER
BROTHER TO SPEND THE EVENING AT MANSFIELD PARK, HEARD THE GOOD NEWS; AND
THOUGH SEEMING TO HAVE NO CONCERN IN THE AFFAIR BEYOND POLITENESS, AND
TO HAVE VENTED ALL HER FEELINGS IN A QUIET CONGRATULATION, HEARD IT WITH
AN ATTENTION NOT SO EASILY SATISFIED. MRS. NORRIS GAVE THE PARTICULARS
OF THE LETTERS, AND THE SUBJECT WAS DROPT; BUT AFTER TEA, AS MISS
CRAWFORD WAS STANDING AT AN OPEN WINDOW WITH EDMUND AND FANNY LOOKING
OUT ON A TWILIGHT SCENE, WHILE THE MISS BERTRAMS, MR. RUSHWORTH,
AND HENRY CRAWFORD WERE ALL BUSY WITH CANDLES AT THE PIANOFORTE, SHE
SUDDENLY REVIVED IT BY TURNING ROUND TOWARDS THE GROUP, AND SAYING, "HOW
HAPPY MR. RUSHWORTH LOOKS! HE IS THINKING OF NOVEMBER."

EDMUND LOOKED ROUND AT MR. RUSHWORTH TOO, BUT HAD NOTHING TO SAY.

"YOUR FATHER'S RETURN WILL BE A VERY INTERESTING EVENT."

"IT WILL, INDEED, AFTER SUCH AN ABSENCE; AN ABSENCE NOT ONLY LONG, BUT
INCLUDING SO MANY DANGERS."

"IT WILL BE THE FORERUNNER ALSO OF OTHER INTERESTING EVENTS: YOUR
SISTER'S MARRIAGE, AND YOUR TAKING ORDERS."

"YES."

"DON'T BE AFFRONTED," SAID SHE, LAUGHING, "BUT IT DOES PUT ME IN MIND OF
SOME OF THE OLD HEATHEN HEROES, WHO, AFTER PERFORMING GREAT EXPLOITS IN
A FOREIGN LAND, OFFERED SACRIFICES TO THE GODS ON THEIR SAFE RETURN."

"THERE IS NO SACRIFICE IN THE CASE," REPLIED EDMUND, WITH A SERIOUS
SMILE, AND GLANCING AT THE PIANOFORTE AGAIN; "IT IS ENTIRELY HER OWN
DOING."

"OH YES I KNOW IT IS. I WAS MERELY JOKING. SHE HAS DONE NO MORE THAN
WHAT EVERY YOUNG WOMAN WOULD DO; AND I HAVE NO DOUBT OF HER BEING
EXTREMELY HAPPY. MY OTHER SACRIFICE, OF COURSE, YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND."

"MY TAKING ORDERS, I ASSURE YOU, IS QUITE AS VOLUNTARY AS MARIA'S
MARRYING."

"IT IS FORTUNATE THAT YOUR INCLINATION AND YOUR FATHER'S CONVENIENCE
SHOULD ACCORD SO WELL. THERE IS A VERY GOOD LIVING KEPT FOR YOU, I
UNDERSTAND, HEREABOUTS."

"WHICH YOU SUPPOSE HAS BIASSED ME?"

"BUT THAT I AM SURE IT HAS NOT," CRIED FANNY.

"THANK YOU FOR YOUR GOOD WORD, FANNY, BUT IT IS MORE THAN I WOULD AFFIRM
MYSELF. ON THE CONTRARY, THE KNOWING THAT THERE WAS SUCH A PROVISION FOR
ME PROBABLY DID BIAS ME. NOR CAN I THINK IT WRONG THAT IT SHOULD. THERE
WAS NO NATURAL DISINCLINATION TO BE OVERCOME, AND I SEE NO REASON WHY
A MAN SHOULD MAKE A WORSE CLERGYMAN FOR KNOWING THAT HE WILL HAVE A
COMPETENCE EARLY IN LIFE. I WAS IN SAFE HANDS. I HOPE I SHOULD NOT HAVE
BEEN INFLUENCED MYSELF IN A WRONG WAY, AND I AM SURE MY FATHER WAS TOO
CONSCIENTIOUS TO HAVE ALLOWED IT. I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT I WAS BIASED, BUT
I THINK IT WAS BLAMELESSLY."

"IT IS THE SAME SORT OF THING," SAID FANNY, AFTER A SHORT PAUSE, "AS FOR
THE SON OF AN ADMIRAL TO GO INTO THE NAVY, OR THE SON OF A GENERAL TO BE
IN THE ARMY, AND NOBODY SEES ANYTHING WRONG IN THAT. NOBODY WONDERS THAT
THEY SHOULD PREFER THE LINE WHERE THEIR FRIENDS CAN SERVE THEM BEST, OR
SUSPECTS THEM TO BE LESS IN EARNEST IN IT THAN THEY APPEAR."

"NO, MY DEAR MISS PRICE, AND FOR REASONS GOOD. THE PROFESSION, EITHER
NAVY OR ARMY, IS ITS OWN JUSTIFICATION. IT HAS EVERYTHING IN ITS FAVOUR:
HEROISM, DANGER, BUSTLE, FASHION. SOLDIERS AND SAILORS ARE ALWAYS
ACCEPTABLE IN SOCIETY. NOBODY CAN WONDER THAT MEN ARE SOLDIERS AND
SAILORS."

"BUT THE MOTIVES OF A MAN WHO TAKES ORDERS WITH THE CERTAINTY OF
PREFERMENT MAY BE FAIRLY SUSPECTED, YOU THINK?" SAID EDMUND. "TO BE
JUSTIFIED IN YOUR EYES, HE MUST DO IT IN THE MOST COMPLETE UNCERTAINTY
OF ANY PROVISION."

"WHAT! TAKE ORDERS WITHOUT A LIVING! NO; THAT IS MADNESS INDEED;
ABSOLUTE MADNESS."

"SHALL I ASK YOU HOW THE CHURCH IS TO BE FILLED, IF A MAN IS NEITHER TO
TAKE ORDERS WITH A LIVING NOR WITHOUT? NO; FOR YOU CERTAINLY WOULD NOT
KNOW WHAT TO SAY. BUT I MUST BEG SOME ADVANTAGE TO THE CLERGYMAN FROM
YOUR OWN ARGUMENT. AS HE CANNOT BE INFLUENCED BY THOSE FEELINGS WHICH
YOU RANK HIGHLY AS TEMPTATION AND REWARD TO THE SOLDIER AND SAILOR IN
THEIR CHOICE OF A PROFESSION, AS HEROISM, AND NOISE, AND FASHION, ARE
ALL AGAINST HIM, HE OUGHT TO BE LESS LIABLE TO THE SUSPICION OF WANTING
SINCERITY OR GOOD INTENTIONS IN THE CHOICE OF HIS."

"OH! NO DOUBT HE IS VERY SINCERE IN PREFERRING AN INCOME READY MADE,
TO THE TROUBLE OF WORKING FOR ONE; AND HAS THE BEST INTENTIONS OF DOING
NOTHING ALL THE REST OF HIS DAYS BUT EAT, DRINK, AND GROW FAT. IT IS
INDOLENCE, MR. BERTRAM, INDEED. INDOLENCE AND LOVE OF EASE; A WANT OF
ALL LAUDABLE AMBITION, OF TASTE FOR GOOD COMPANY, OR OF INCLINATION
TO TAKE THE TROUBLE OF BEING AGREEABLE, WHICH MAKE MEN CLERGYMEN.
A CLERGYMAN HAS NOTHING TO DO BUT BE SLOVENLY AND SELFISH--READ THE
NEWSPAPER, WATCH THE WEATHER, AND QUARREL WITH HIS WIFE. HIS CURATE DOES
ALL THE WORK, AND THE BUSINESS OF HIS OWN LIFE IS TO DINE."

"THERE ARE SUCH CLERGYMEN, NO DOUBT, BUT I THINK THEY ARE NOT SO COMMON
AS TO JUSTIFY MISS CRAWFORD IN ESTEEMING IT THEIR GENERAL CHARACTER. I
SUSPECT THAT IN THIS COMPREHENSIVE AND (MAY I SAY) COMMONPLACE CENSURE,
YOU ARE NOT JUDGING FROM YOURSELF, BUT FROM PREJUDICED PERSONS, WHOSE
OPINIONS YOU HAVE BEEN IN THE HABIT OF HEARING. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT
YOUR OWN OBSERVATION CAN HAVE GIVEN YOU MUCH KNOWLEDGE OF THE CLERGY.
YOU CAN HAVE BEEN PERSONALLY ACQUAINTED WITH VERY FEW OF A SET OF MEN
YOU CONDEMN SO CONCLUSIVELY. YOU ARE SPEAKING WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN TOLD AT
YOUR UNCLE'S TABLE."

"I SPEAK WHAT APPEARS TO ME THE GENERAL OPINION; AND WHERE AN OPINION
IS GENERAL, IT IS USUALLY CORRECT. THOUGH I HAVE NOT SEEN MUCH OF
THE DOMESTIC LIVES OF CLERGYMEN, IT IS SEEN BY TOO MANY TO LEAVE ANY
DEFICIENCY OF INFORMATION."

"WHERE ANY ONE BODY OF EDUCATED MEN, OF WHATEVER DENOMINATION, ARE
CONDEMNED INDISCRIMINATELY, THERE MUST BE A DEFICIENCY OF INFORMATION,
OR (SMILING) OF SOMETHING ELSE. YOUR UNCLE, AND HIS BROTHER ADMIRALS,
PERHAPS KNEW LITTLE OF CLERGYMEN BEYOND THE CHAPLAINS WHOM, GOOD OR BAD,
THEY WERE ALWAYS WISHING AWAY."

"POOR WILLIAM! HE HAS MET WITH GREAT KINDNESS FROM THE CHAPLAIN OF THE
ANTWERP," WAS A TENDER APOSTROPHE OF FANNY'S, VERY MUCH TO THE PURPOSE
OF HER OWN FEELINGS IF NOT OF THE CONVERSATION.

"I HAVE BEEN SO LITTLE ADDICTED TO TAKE MY OPINIONS FROM MY UNCLE,"
SAID MISS CRAWFORD, "THAT I CAN HARDLY SUPPOSE--AND SINCE YOU PUSH ME SO
HARD, I MUST OBSERVE, THAT I AM NOT ENTIRELY WITHOUT THE MEANS OF SEEING
WHAT CLERGYMEN ARE, BEING AT THIS PRESENT TIME THE GUEST OF MY OWN
BROTHER, DR. GRANT. AND THOUGH DR. GRANT IS MOST KIND AND OBLIGING TO
ME, AND THOUGH HE IS REALLY A GENTLEMAN, AND, I DARE SAY, A GOOD SCHOLAR
AND CLEVER, AND OFTEN PREACHES GOOD SERMONS, AND IS VERY RESPECTABLE,
I SEE HIM TO BE AN INDOLENT, SELFISH BON VIVANT, WHO MUST HAVE
HIS PALATE CONSULTED IN EVERYTHING; WHO WILL NOT STIR A FINGER FOR THE
CONVENIENCE OF ANY ONE; AND WHO, MOREOVER, IF THE COOK MAKES A BLUNDER,
IS OUT OF HUMOUR WITH HIS EXCELLENT WIFE. TO OWN THE TRUTH, HENRY AND
I WERE PARTLY DRIVEN OUT THIS VERY EVENING BY A DISAPPOINTMENT ABOUT A
GREEN GOOSE, WHICH HE COULD NOT GET THE BETTER OF. MY POOR SISTER WAS
FORCED TO STAY AND BEAR IT."

"I DO NOT WONDER AT YOUR DISAPPROBATION, UPON MY WORD. IT IS A GREAT
DEFECT OF TEMPER, MADE WORSE BY A VERY FAULTY HABIT OF SELF-INDULGENCE;
AND TO SEE YOUR SISTER SUFFERING FROM IT MUST BE EXCEEDINGLY PAINFUL TO
SUCH FEELINGS AS YOURS. FANNY, IT GOES AGAINST US. WE CANNOT ATTEMPT TO
DEFEND DR. GRANT."

"NO," REPLIED FANNY, "BUT WE NEED NOT GIVE UP HIS PROFESSION FOR ALL
THAT; BECAUSE, WHATEVER PROFESSION DR. GRANT HAD CHOSEN, HE WOULD HAVE
TAKEN A--NOT A GOOD TEMPER INTO IT; AND AS HE MUST, EITHER IN THE NAVY
OR ARMY, HAVE HAD A GREAT MANY MORE PEOPLE UNDER HIS COMMAND THAN HE
HAS NOW, I THINK MORE WOULD HAVE BEEN MADE UNHAPPY BY HIM AS A SAILOR OR
SOLDIER THAN AS A CLERGYMAN. BESIDES, I CANNOT BUT SUPPOSE THAT WHATEVER
THERE MAY BE TO WISH OTHERWISE IN DR. GRANT WOULD HAVE BEEN IN A GREATER
DANGER OF BECOMING WORSE IN A MORE ACTIVE AND WORLDLY PROFESSION, WHERE
HE WOULD HAVE HAD LESS TIME AND OBLIGATION--WHERE HE MIGHT HAVE ESCAPED
THAT KNOWLEDGE OF HIMSELF, THE FREQUENCY, AT LEAST, OF THAT KNOWLEDGE
WHICH IT IS IMPOSSIBLE HE SHOULD ESCAPE AS HE IS NOW. A MAN--A SENSIBLE
MAN LIKE DR. GRANT, CANNOT BE IN THE HABIT OF TEACHING OTHERS THEIR DUTY
EVERY WEEK, CANNOT GO TO CHURCH TWICE EVERY SUNDAY, AND PREACH SUCH VERY
GOOD SERMONS IN SO GOOD A MANNER AS HE DOES, WITHOUT BEING THE BETTER
FOR IT HIMSELF. IT MUST MAKE HIM THINK; AND I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT HE
OFTENER ENDEAVOURS TO RESTRAIN HIMSELF THAN HE WOULD IF HE HAD BEEN
ANYTHING BUT A CLERGYMAN."

"WE CANNOT PROVE TO THE CONTRARY, TO BE SURE; BUT I WISH YOU A BETTER
FATE, MISS PRICE, THAN TO BE THE WIFE OF A MAN WHOSE AMIABLENESS
DEPENDS UPON HIS OWN SERMONS; FOR THOUGH HE MAY PREACH HIMSELF INTO A
GOOD-HUMOUR EVERY SUNDAY, IT WILL BE BAD ENOUGH TO HAVE HIM QUARRELLING
ABOUT GREEN GEESE FROM MONDAY MORNING TILL SATURDAY NIGHT."

"I THINK THE MAN WHO COULD OFTEN QUARREL WITH FANNY," SAID EDMUND
AFFECTIONATELY, "MUST BE BEYOND THE REACH OF ANY SERMONS."

FANNY TURNED FARTHER INTO THE WINDOW; AND MISS CRAWFORD HAD ONLY TIME
TO SAY, IN A PLEASANT MANNER, "I FANCY MISS PRICE HAS BEEN MORE USED TO
DESERVE PRAISE THAN TO HEAR IT"; WHEN, BEING EARNESTLY INVITED BY THE
MISS BERTRAMS TO JOIN IN A GLEE, SHE TRIPPED OFF TO THE INSTRUMENT,
LEAVING EDMUND LOOKING AFTER HER IN AN ECSTASY OF ADMIRATION OF ALL HER
MANY VIRTUES, FROM HER OBLIGING MANNERS DOWN TO HER LIGHT AND GRACEFUL
TREAD.

"THERE GOES GOOD-HUMOUR, I AM SURE," SAID HE PRESENTLY. "THERE GOES A
TEMPER WHICH WOULD NEVER GIVE PAIN! HOW WELL SHE WALKS! AND HOW READILY
SHE FALLS IN WITH THE INCLINATION OF OTHERS! JOINING THEM THE MOMENT SHE
IS ASKED. WHAT A PITY," HE ADDED, AFTER AN INSTANT'S REFLECTION, "THAT
SHE SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN SUCH HANDS!"

FANNY AGREED TO IT, AND HAD THE PLEASURE OF SEEING HIM CONTINUE AT THE
WINDOW WITH HER, IN SPITE OF THE EXPECTED GLEE; AND OF HAVING HIS EYES
SOON TURNED, LIKE HERS, TOWARDS THE SCENE WITHOUT, WHERE ALL THAT WAS
SOLEMN, AND SOOTHING, AND LOVELY, APPEARED IN THE BRILLIANCY OF AN
UNCLOUDED NIGHT, AND THE CONTRAST OF THE DEEP SHADE OF THE WOODS. FANNY
SPOKE HER FEELINGS. "HERE'S HARMONY!" SAID SHE; "HERE'S REPOSE! HERE'S
WHAT MAY LEAVE ALL PAINTING AND ALL MUSIC BEHIND, AND WHAT POETRY ONLY
CAN ATTEMPT TO DESCRIBE! HERE'S WHAT MAY TRANQUILLISE EVERY CARE, AND
LIFT THE HEART TO RAPTURE! WHEN I LOOK OUT ON SUCH A NIGHT AS THIS, I
FEEL AS IF THERE COULD BE NEITHER WICKEDNESS NOR SORROW IN THE WORLD;
AND THERE CERTAINLY WOULD BE LESS OF BOTH IF THE SUBLIMITY OF NATURE
WERE MORE ATTENDED TO, AND PEOPLE WERE CARRIED MORE OUT OF THEMSELVES BY
CONTEMPLATING SUCH A SCENE."

"I LIKE TO HEAR YOUR ENTHUSIASM, FANNY. IT IS A LOVELY NIGHT, AND THEY
ARE MUCH TO BE PITIED WHO HAVE NOT BEEN TAUGHT TO FEEL, IN SOME DEGREE,
AS YOU DO; WHO HAVE NOT, AT LEAST, BEEN GIVEN A TASTE FOR NATURE IN
EARLY LIFE. THEY LOSE A GREAT DEAL."

"YOU TAUGHT ME TO THINK AND FEEL ON THE SUBJECT, COUSIN."

"I HAD A VERY APT SCHOLAR. THERE'S ARCTURUS LOOKING VERY BRIGHT."

"YES, AND THE BEAR. I WISH I COULD SEE CASSIOPEIA."

"WE MUST GO OUT ON THE LAWN FOR THAT. SHOULD YOU BE AFRAID?"

"NOT IN THE LEAST. IT IS A GREAT WHILE SINCE WE HAVE HAD ANY
STAR-GAZING."

"YES; I DO NOT KNOW HOW IT HAS HAPPENED." THE GLEE BEGAN. "WE WILL STAY
TILL THIS IS FINISHED, FANNY," SAID HE, TURNING HIS BACK ON THE WINDOW;
AND AS IT ADVANCED, SHE HAD THE MORTIFICATION OF SEEING HIM ADVANCE TOO,
MOVING FORWARD BY GENTLE DEGREES TOWARDS THE INSTRUMENT, AND WHEN IT
CEASED, HE WAS CLOSE BY THE SINGERS, AMONG THE MOST URGENT IN REQUESTING
TO HEAR THE GLEE AGAIN.

FANNY SIGHED ALONE AT THE WINDOW TILL SCOLDED AWAY BY MRS. NORRIS'S
THREATS OF CATCHING COLD.



CHAPTER XII

SIR THOMAS WAS TO RETURN IN NOVEMBER, AND HIS ELDEST SON HAD DUTIES TO
CALL HIM EARLIER HOME. THE APPROACH OF SEPTEMBER BROUGHT TIDINGS OF MR.
BERTRAM, FIRST IN A LETTER TO THE GAMEKEEPER AND THEN IN A LETTER
TO EDMUND; AND BY THE END OF AUGUST HE ARRIVED HIMSELF, TO BE GAY,
AGREEABLE, AND GALLANT AGAIN AS OCCASION SERVED, OR MISS CRAWFORD
DEMANDED; TO TELL OF RACES AND WEYMOUTH, AND PARTIES AND FRIENDS, TO
WHICH SHE MIGHT HAVE LISTENED SIX WEEKS BEFORE WITH SOME INTEREST, AND
ALTOGETHER TO GIVE HER THE FULLEST CONVICTION, BY THE POWER OF ACTUAL
COMPARISON, OF HER PREFERRING HIS YOUNGER BROTHER.

IT WAS VERY VEXATIOUS, AND SHE WAS HEARTILY SORRY FOR IT; BUT SO IT WAS;
AND SO FAR FROM NOW MEANING TO MARRY THE ELDER, SHE DID NOT EVEN WANT
TO ATTRACT HIM BEYOND WHAT THE SIMPLEST CLAIMS OF CONSCIOUS BEAUTY
REQUIRED: HIS LENGTHENED ABSENCE FROM MANSFIELD, WITHOUT ANYTHING BUT
PLEASURE IN VIEW, AND HIS OWN WILL TO CONSULT, MADE IT PERFECTLY CLEAR
THAT HE DID NOT CARE ABOUT HER; AND HIS INDIFFERENCE WAS SO MUCH MORE
THAN EQUALLED BY HER OWN, THAT WERE HE NOW TO STEP FORTH THE OWNER OF
MANSFIELD PARK, THE SIR THOMAS COMPLETE, WHICH HE WAS TO BE IN TIME, SHE
DID NOT BELIEVE SHE COULD ACCEPT HIM.

THE SEASON AND DUTIES WHICH BROUGHT MR. BERTRAM BACK TO MANSFIELD TOOK
MR. CRAWFORD INTO NORFOLK. EVERINGHAM COULD NOT DO WITHOUT HIM IN THE
BEGINNING OF SEPTEMBER. HE WENT FOR A FORTNIGHT--A FORTNIGHT OF SUCH
DULLNESS TO THE MISS BERTRAMS AS OUGHT TO HAVE PUT THEM BOTH ON THEIR
GUARD, AND MADE EVEN JULIA ADMIT, IN HER JEALOUSY OF HER SISTER, THE
ABSOLUTE NECESSITY OF DISTRUSTING HIS ATTENTIONS, AND WISHING HIM NOT
TO RETURN; AND A FORTNIGHT OF SUFFICIENT LEISURE, IN THE INTERVALS OF
SHOOTING AND SLEEPING, TO HAVE CONVINCED THE GENTLEMAN THAT HE OUGHT
TO KEEP LONGER AWAY, HAD HE BEEN MORE IN THE HABIT OF EXAMINING HIS OWN
MOTIVES, AND OF REFLECTING TO WHAT THE INDULGENCE OF HIS IDLE VANITY WAS
TENDING; BUT, THOUGHTLESS AND SELFISH FROM PROSPERITY AND BAD EXAMPLE,
HE WOULD NOT LOOK BEYOND THE PRESENT MOMENT. THE SISTERS, HANDSOME,
CLEVER, AND ENCOURAGING, WERE AN AMUSEMENT TO HIS SATED MIND; AND
FINDING NOTHING IN NORFOLK TO EQUAL THE SOCIAL PLEASURES OF MANSFIELD,
HE GLADLY RETURNED TO IT AT THE TIME APPOINTED, AND WAS WELCOMED THITHER
QUITE AS GLADLY BY THOSE WHOM HE CAME TO TRIFLE WITH FURTHER.

MARIA, WITH ONLY MR. RUSHWORTH TO ATTEND TO HER, AND DOOMED TO THE
REPEATED DETAILS OF HIS DAY'S SPORT, GOOD OR BAD, HIS BOAST OF HIS DOGS,
HIS JEALOUSY OF HIS NEIGHBOURS, HIS DOUBTS OF THEIR QUALIFICATIONS,
AND HIS ZEAL AFTER POACHERS, SUBJECTS WHICH WILL NOT FIND THEIR WAY TO
FEMALE FEELINGS WITHOUT SOME TALENT ON ONE SIDE OR SOME ATTACHMENT ON
THE OTHER, HAD MISSED MR. CRAWFORD GRIEVOUSLY; AND JULIA, UNENGAGED AND
UNEMPLOYED, FELT ALL THE RIGHT OF MISSING HIM MUCH MORE. EACH SISTER
BELIEVED HERSELF THE FAVOURITE. JULIA MIGHT BE JUSTIFIED IN SO DOING BY
THE HINTS OF MRS. GRANT, INCLINED TO CREDIT WHAT SHE WISHED, AND MARIA
BY THE HINTS OF MR. CRAWFORD HIMSELF. EVERYTHING RETURNED INTO THE SAME
CHANNEL AS BEFORE HIS ABSENCE; HIS MANNERS BEING TO EACH SO ANIMATED AND
AGREEABLE AS TO LOSE NO GROUND WITH EITHER, AND JUST STOPPING SHORT OF
THE CONSISTENCE, THE STEADINESS, THE SOLICITUDE, AND THE WARMTH WHICH
MIGHT EXCITE GENERAL NOTICE.

FANNY WAS THE ONLY ONE OF THE PARTY WHO FOUND ANYTHING TO DISLIKE; BUT
SINCE THE DAY AT SOTHERTON, SHE COULD NEVER SEE MR. CRAWFORD WITH EITHER
SISTER WITHOUT OBSERVATION, AND SELDOM WITHOUT WONDER OR CENSURE; AND
HAD HER CONFIDENCE IN HER OWN JUDGMENT BEEN EQUAL TO HER EXERCISE OF IT
IN EVERY OTHER RESPECT, HAD SHE BEEN SURE THAT SHE WAS SEEING CLEARLY,
AND JUDGING CANDIDLY, SHE WOULD PROBABLY HAVE MADE SOME IMPORTANT
COMMUNICATIONS TO HER USUAL CONFIDANT. AS IT WAS, HOWEVER, SHE ONLY
HAZARDED A HINT, AND THE HINT WAS LOST. "I AM RATHER SURPRISED," SAID
SHE, "THAT MR. CRAWFORD SHOULD COME BACK AGAIN SO SOON, AFTER BEING HERE
SO LONG BEFORE, FULL SEVEN WEEKS; FOR I HAD UNDERSTOOD HE WAS SO
VERY FOND OF CHANGE AND MOVING ABOUT, THAT I THOUGHT SOMETHING WOULD
CERTAINLY OCCUR, WHEN HE WAS ONCE GONE, TO TAKE HIM ELSEWHERE. HE IS
USED TO MUCH GAYER PLACES THAN MANSFIELD."

"IT IS TO HIS CREDIT," WAS EDMUND'S ANSWER; "AND I DARE SAY IT GIVES HIS
SISTER PLEASURE. SHE DOES NOT LIKE HIS UNSETTLED HABITS."

"WHAT A FAVOURITE HE IS WITH MY COUSINS!"

"YES, HIS MANNERS TO WOMEN ARE SUCH AS MUST PLEASE. MRS. GRANT, I
BELIEVE, SUSPECTS HIM OF A PREFERENCE FOR JULIA; I HAVE NEVER SEEN MUCH
SYMPTOM OF IT, BUT I WISH IT MAY BE SO. HE HAS NO FAULTS BUT WHAT A
SERIOUS ATTACHMENT WOULD REMOVE."

"IF MISS BERTRAM WERE NOT ENGAGED," SAID FANNY CAUTIOUSLY, "I COULD
SOMETIMES ALMOST THINK THAT HE ADMIRED HER MORE THAN JULIA."

"WHICH IS, PERHAPS, MORE IN FAVOUR OF HIS LIKING JULIA BEST, THAN YOU,
FANNY, MAY BE AWARE; FOR I BELIEVE IT OFTEN HAPPENS THAT A MAN, BEFORE
HE HAS QUITE MADE UP HIS OWN MIND, WILL DISTINGUISH THE SISTER OR
INTIMATE FRIEND OF THE WOMAN HE IS REALLY THINKING OF MORE THAN THE
WOMAN HERSELF. CRAWFORD HAS TOO MUCH SENSE TO STAY HERE IF HE FOUND
HIMSELF IN ANY DANGER FROM MARIA; AND I AM NOT AT ALL AFRAID FOR HER,
AFTER SUCH A PROOF AS SHE HAS GIVEN THAT HER FEELINGS ARE NOT STRONG."

FANNY SUPPOSED SHE MUST HAVE BEEN MISTAKEN, AND MEANT TO THINK
DIFFERENTLY IN FUTURE; BUT WITH ALL THAT SUBMISSION TO EDMUND COULD
DO, AND ALL THE HELP OF THE COINCIDING LOOKS AND HINTS WHICH SHE
OCCASIONALLY NOTICED IN SOME OF THE OTHERS, AND WHICH SEEMED TO SAY THAT
JULIA WAS MR. CRAWFORD'S CHOICE, SHE KNEW NOT ALWAYS WHAT TO THINK. SHE
WAS PRIVY, ONE EVENING, TO THE HOPES OF HER AUNT NORRIS ON THE SUBJECT,
AS WELL AS TO HER FEELINGS, AND THE FEELINGS OF MRS. RUSHWORTH, ON A
POINT OF SOME SIMILARITY, AND COULD NOT HELP WONDERING AS SHE LISTENED;
AND GLAD WOULD SHE HAVE BEEN NOT TO BE OBLIGED TO LISTEN, FOR IT WAS
WHILE ALL THE OTHER YOUNG PEOPLE WERE DANCING, AND SHE SITTING,
MOST UNWILLINGLY, AMONG THE CHAPERONS AT THE FIRE, LONGING FOR THE
RE-ENTRANCE OF HER ELDER COUSIN, ON WHOM ALL HER OWN HOPES OF A PARTNER
THEN DEPENDED. IT WAS FANNY'S FIRST BALL, THOUGH WITHOUT THE PREPARATION
OR SPLENDOUR OF MANY A YOUNG LADY'S FIRST BALL, BEING THE THOUGHT ONLY
OF THE AFTERNOON, BUILT ON THE LATE ACQUISITION OF A VIOLIN PLAYER IN
THE SERVANTS' HALL, AND THE POSSIBILITY OF RAISING FIVE COUPLE WITH
THE HELP OF MRS. GRANT AND A NEW INTIMATE FRIEND OF MR. BERTRAM'S JUST
ARRIVED ON A VISIT. IT HAD, HOWEVER, BEEN A VERY HAPPY ONE TO FANNY
THROUGH FOUR DANCES, AND SHE WAS QUITE GRIEVED TO BE LOSING EVEN A
QUARTER OF AN HOUR. WHILE WAITING AND WISHING, LOOKING NOW AT
THE DANCERS AND NOW AT THE DOOR, THIS DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE TWO
ABOVE-MENTIONED LADIES WAS FORCED ON HER--

"I THINK, MA'AM," SAID MRS. NORRIS, HER EYES DIRECTED TOWARDS MR.
RUSHWORTH AND MARIA, WHO WERE PARTNERS FOR THE SECOND TIME, "WE SHALL
SEE SOME HAPPY FACES AGAIN NOW."

"YES, MA'AM, INDEED," REPLIED THE OTHER, WITH A STATELY SIMPER, "THERE
WILL BE SOME SATISFACTION IN LOOKING ON NOW, AND I THINK IT WAS RATHER
A PITY THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN OBLIGED TO PART. YOUNG FOLKS IN THEIR
SITUATION SHOULD BE EXCUSED COMPLYING WITH THE COMMON FORMS. I WONDER MY
SON DID NOT PROPOSE IT."

"I DARE SAY HE DID, MA'AM. MR. RUSHWORTH IS NEVER REMISS. BUT DEAR MARIA
HAS SUCH A STRICT SENSE OF PROPRIETY, SO MUCH OF THAT TRUE DELICACY
WHICH ONE SELDOM MEETS WITH NOWADAYS, MRS. RUSHWORTH--THAT WISH OF
AVOIDING PARTICULARITY! DEAR MA'AM, ONLY LOOK AT HER FACE AT THIS
MOMENT; HOW DIFFERENT FROM WHAT IT WAS THE TWO LAST DANCES!"

MISS BERTRAM DID INDEED LOOK HAPPY, HER EYES WERE SPARKLING WITH
PLEASURE, AND SHE WAS SPEAKING WITH GREAT ANIMATION, FOR JULIA AND HER
PARTNER, MR. CRAWFORD, WERE CLOSE TO HER; THEY WERE ALL IN A CLUSTER
TOGETHER. HOW SHE HAD LOOKED BEFORE, FANNY COULD NOT RECOLLECT, FOR SHE
HAD BEEN DANCING WITH EDMUND HERSELF, AND HAD NOT THOUGHT ABOUT HER.

MRS. NORRIS CONTINUED, "IT IS QUITE DELIGHTFUL, MA'AM, TO SEE YOUNG
PEOPLE SO PROPERLY HAPPY, SO WELL SUITED, AND SO MUCH THE THING! I
CANNOT BUT THINK OF DEAR SIR THOMAS'S DELIGHT. AND WHAT DO YOU SAY,
MA'AM, TO THE CHANCE OF ANOTHER MATCH? MR. RUSHWORTH HAS SET A GOOD
EXAMPLE, AND SUCH THINGS ARE VERY CATCHING."

MRS. RUSHWORTH, WHO SAW NOTHING BUT HER SON, WAS QUITE AT A LOSS.

"THE COUPLE ABOVE, MA'AM. DO YOU SEE NO SYMPTOMS THERE?"

"OH DEAR! MISS JULIA AND MR. CRAWFORD. YES, INDEED, A VERY PRETTY MATCH.
WHAT IS HIS PROPERTY?"

"FOUR THOUSAND A YEAR."

"VERY WELL. THOSE WHO HAVE NOT MORE MUST BE SATISFIED WITH WHAT THEY
HAVE. FOUR THOUSAND A YEAR IS A PRETTY ESTATE, AND HE SEEMS A VERY
GENTEEL, STEADY YOUNG MAN, SO I HOPE MISS JULIA WILL BE VERY HAPPY."

"IT IS NOT A SETTLED THING, MA'AM, YET. WE ONLY SPEAK OF IT AMONG
FRIENDS. BUT I HAVE VERY LITTLE DOUBT IT WILL BE. HE IS GROWING
EXTREMELY PARTICULAR IN HIS ATTENTIONS."

FANNY COULD LISTEN NO FARTHER. LISTENING AND WONDERING WERE ALL
SUSPENDED FOR A TIME, FOR MR. BERTRAM WAS IN THE ROOM AGAIN; AND THOUGH
FEELING IT WOULD BE A GREAT HONOUR TO BE ASKED BY HIM, SHE THOUGHT IT
MUST HAPPEN. HE CAME TOWARDS THEIR LITTLE CIRCLE; BUT INSTEAD OF ASKING
HER TO DANCE, DREW A CHAIR NEAR HER, AND GAVE HER AN ACCOUNT OF THE
PRESENT STATE OF A SICK HORSE, AND THE OPINION OF THE GROOM, FROM
WHOM HE HAD JUST PARTED. FANNY FOUND THAT IT WAS NOT TO BE, AND IN THE
MODESTY OF HER NATURE IMMEDIATELY FELT THAT SHE HAD BEEN UNREASONABLE
IN EXPECTING IT. WHEN HE HAD TOLD OF HIS HORSE, HE TOOK A NEWSPAPER FROM
THE TABLE, AND LOOKING OVER IT, SAID IN A LANGUID WAY, "IF YOU WANT TO
DANCE, FANNY, I WILL STAND UP WITH YOU." WITH MORE THAN EQUAL CIVILITY
THE OFFER WAS DECLINED; SHE DID NOT WISH TO DANCE. "I AM GLAD OF IT,"
SAID HE, IN A MUCH BRISKER TONE, AND THROWING DOWN THE NEWSPAPER AGAIN,
"FOR I AM TIRED TO DEATH. I ONLY WONDER HOW THE GOOD PEOPLE CAN KEEP
IT UP SO LONG. THEY HAD NEED BE ALL IN LOVE, TO FIND ANY AMUSEMENT IN
SUCH FOLLY; AND SO THEY ARE, I FANCY. IF YOU LOOK AT THEM YOU MAY SEE
THEY ARE SO MANY COUPLE OF LOVERS--ALL BUT YATES AND MRS. GRANT--AND,
BETWEEN OURSELVES, SHE, POOR WOMAN, MUST WANT A LOVER AS MUCH AS ANY ONE
OF THEM. A DESPERATE DULL LIFE HERS MUST BE WITH THE DOCTOR," MAKING
A SLY FACE AS HE SPOKE TOWARDS THE CHAIR OF THE LATTER, WHO PROVING,
HOWEVER, TO BE CLOSE AT HIS ELBOW, MADE SO INSTANTANEOUS A CHANGE OF
EXPRESSION AND SUBJECT NECESSARY, AS FANNY, IN SPITE OF EVERYTHING,
COULD HARDLY HELP LAUGHING AT. "A STRANGE BUSINESS THIS IN AMERICA, DR.
GRANT! WHAT IS YOUR OPINION? I ALWAYS COME TO YOU TO KNOW WHAT I AM TO
THINK OF PUBLIC MATTERS."

"MY DEAR TOM," CRIED HIS AUNT SOON AFTERWARDS, "AS YOU ARE NOT DANCING,
I DARE SAY YOU WILL HAVE NO OBJECTION TO JOIN US IN A RUBBER; SHALL
YOU?" THEN LEAVING HER SEAT, AND COMING TO HIM TO ENFORCE THE PROPOSAL,
ADDED IN A WHISPER, "WE WANT TO MAKE A TABLE FOR MRS. RUSHWORTH, YOU
KNOW. YOUR MOTHER IS QUITE ANXIOUS ABOUT IT, BUT CANNOT VERY WELL SPARE
TIME TO SIT DOWN HERSELF, BECAUSE OF HER FRINGE. NOW, YOU AND I AND DR.
GRANT WILL JUST DO; AND THOUGH WE PLAY BUT HALF-CROWNS, YOU KNOW, YOU
MAY BET HALF-GUINEAS WITH HIM."

"I SHOULD BE MOST HAPPY," REPLIED HE ALOUD, AND JUMPING UP WITH
ALACRITY, "IT WOULD GIVE ME THE GREATEST PLEASURE; BUT THAT I AM
THIS MOMENT GOING TO DANCE." COME, FANNY, TAKING HER HAND, "DO NOT BE
DAWDLING ANY LONGER, OR THE DANCE WILL BE OVER."

FANNY WAS LED OFF VERY WILLINGLY, THOUGH IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HER TO
FEEL MUCH GRATITUDE TOWARDS HER COUSIN, OR DISTINGUISH, AS HE CERTAINLY
DID, BETWEEN THE SELFISHNESS OF ANOTHER PERSON AND HIS OWN.

"A PRETTY MODEST REQUEST UPON MY WORD," HE INDIGNANTLY EXCLAIMED AS THEY
WALKED AWAY. "TO WANT TO NAIL ME TO A CARD-TABLE FOR THE NEXT TWO HOURS
WITH HERSELF AND DR. GRANT, WHO ARE ALWAYS QUARRELLING, AND THAT POKING
OLD WOMAN, WHO KNOWS NO MORE OF WHIST THAN OF ALGEBRA. I WISH MY GOOD
AUNT WOULD BE A LITTLE LESS BUSY! AND TO ASK ME IN SUCH A WAY TOO!
WITHOUT CEREMONY, BEFORE THEM ALL, SO AS TO LEAVE ME NO POSSIBILITY
OF REFUSING. THAT IS WHAT I DISLIKE MOST PARTICULARLY. IT RAISES MY
SPLEEN MORE THAN ANYTHING, TO HAVE THE PRETENCE OF BEING ASKED, OF
BEING GIVEN A CHOICE, AND AT THE SAME TIME ADDRESSED IN SUCH A WAY AS
TO OBLIGE ONE TO DO THE VERY THING, WHATEVER IT BE! IF I HAD NOT LUCKILY
THOUGHT OF STANDING UP WITH YOU I COULD NOT HAVE GOT OUT OF IT. IT IS
A GREAT DEAL TOO BAD. BUT WHEN MY AUNT HAS GOT A FANCY IN HER HEAD,
NOTHING CAN STOP HER."



CHAPTER XIII

THE HONOURABLE JOHN YATES, THIS NEW FRIEND, HAD NOT MUCH TO RECOMMEND
HIM BEYOND HABITS OF FASHION AND EXPENSE, AND BEING THE YOUNGER SON OF
A LORD WITH A TOLERABLE INDEPENDENCE; AND SIR THOMAS WOULD PROBABLY
HAVE THOUGHT HIS INTRODUCTION AT MANSFIELD BY NO MEANS DESIRABLE. MR.
BERTRAM'S ACQUAINTANCE WITH HIM HAD BEGUN AT WEYMOUTH, WHERE THEY HAD
SPENT TEN DAYS TOGETHER IN THE SAME SOCIETY, AND THE FRIENDSHIP, IF
FRIENDSHIP IT MIGHT BE CALLED, HAD BEEN PROVED AND PERFECTED BY MR.
YATES'S BEING INVITED TO TAKE MANSFIELD IN HIS WAY, WHENEVER HE COULD,
AND BY HIS PROMISING TO COME; AND HE DID COME RATHER EARLIER THAN HAD
BEEN EXPECTED, IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE SUDDEN BREAKING-UP OF A LARGE PARTY
ASSEMBLED FOR GAIETY AT THE HOUSE OF ANOTHER FRIEND, WHICH HE HAD LEFT
WEYMOUTH TO JOIN. HE CAME ON THE WINGS OF DISAPPOINTMENT, AND WITH HIS
HEAD FULL OF ACTING, FOR IT HAD BEEN A THEATRICAL PARTY; AND THE PLAY
IN WHICH HE HAD BORNE A PART WAS WITHIN TWO DAYS OF REPRESENTATION,
WHEN THE SUDDEN DEATH OF ONE OF THE NEAREST CONNEXIONS OF THE FAMILY
HAD DESTROYED THE SCHEME AND DISPERSED THE PERFORMERS. TO BE SO NEAR
HAPPINESS, SO NEAR FAME, SO NEAR THE LONG PARAGRAPH IN PRAISE OF THE
PRIVATE THEATRICALS AT ECCLESFORD, THE SEAT OF THE RIGHT HON. LORD
RAVENSHAW, IN CORNWALL, WHICH WOULD OF COURSE HAVE IMMORTALISED THE
WHOLE PARTY FOR AT LEAST A TWELVEMONTH! AND BEING SO NEAR, TO LOSE
IT ALL, WAS AN INJURY TO BE KEENLY FELT, AND MR. YATES COULD TALK OF
NOTHING ELSE. ECCLESFORD AND ITS THEATRE, WITH ITS ARRANGEMENTS AND
DRESSES, REHEARSALS AND JOKES, WAS HIS NEVER-FAILING SUBJECT, AND TO
BOAST OF THE PAST HIS ONLY CONSOLATION.

HAPPILY FOR HIM, A LOVE OF THE THEATRE IS SO GENERAL, AN ITCH FOR ACTING
SO STRONG AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE, THAT HE COULD HARDLY OUT-TALK THE INTEREST
OF HIS HEARERS. FROM THE FIRST CASTING OF THE PARTS TO THE EPILOGUE IT
WAS ALL BEWITCHING, AND THERE WERE FEW WHO DID NOT WISH TO HAVE BEEN A
PARTY CONCERNED, OR WOULD HAVE HESITATED TO TRY THEIR SKILL. THE PLAY
HAD BEEN LOVERS' VOWS, AND MR. YATES WAS TO HAVE BEEN COUNT CASSEL. "A
TRIFLING PART," SAID HE, "AND NOT AT ALL TO MY TASTE, AND SUCH A ONE
AS I CERTAINLY WOULD NOT ACCEPT AGAIN; BUT I WAS DETERMINED TO MAKE NO
DIFFICULTIES. LORD RAVENSHAW AND THE DUKE HAD APPROPRIATED THE ONLY TWO
CHARACTERS WORTH PLAYING BEFORE I REACHED ECCLESFORD; AND THOUGH LORD
RAVENSHAW OFFERED TO RESIGN HIS TO ME, IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO TAKE IT, YOU
KNOW. I WAS SORRY FOR HIM THAT HE SHOULD HAVE SO MISTAKEN HIS POWERS,
FOR HE WAS NO MORE EQUAL TO THE BARON--A LITTLE MAN WITH A WEAK VOICE,
ALWAYS HOARSE AFTER THE FIRST TEN MINUTES. IT MUST HAVE INJURED THE
PIECE MATERIALLY; BUT I WAS RESOLVED TO MAKE NO DIFFICULTIES. SIR
HENRY THOUGHT THE DUKE NOT EQUAL TO FREDERICK, BUT THAT WAS BECAUSE
SIR HENRY WANTED THE PART HIMSELF; WHEREAS IT WAS CERTAINLY IN THE BEST
HANDS OF THE TWO. I WAS SURPRISED TO SEE SIR HENRY SUCH A STICK. LUCKILY
THE STRENGTH OF THE PIECE DID NOT DEPEND UPON HIM. OUR AGATHA WAS
INIMITABLE, AND THE DUKE WAS THOUGHT VERY GREAT BY MANY. AND UPON THE
WHOLE, IT WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE GONE OFF WONDERFULLY."

"IT WAS A HARD CASE, UPON MY WORD"; AND, "I DO THINK YOU WERE VERY MUCH
TO BE PITIED," WERE THE KIND RESPONSES OF LISTENING SYMPATHY.

"IT IS NOT WORTH COMPLAINING ABOUT; BUT TO BE SURE THE POOR OLD DOWAGER
COULD NOT HAVE DIED AT A WORSE TIME; AND IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO HELP
WISHING THAT THE NEWS COULD HAVE BEEN SUPPRESSED FOR JUST THE THREE DAYS
WE WANTED. IT WAS BUT THREE DAYS; AND BEING ONLY A GRANDMOTHER, AND ALL
HAPPENING TWO HUNDRED MILES OFF, I THINK THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO GREAT
HARM, AND IT WAS SUGGESTED, I KNOW; BUT LORD RAVENSHAW, WHO I SUPPOSE IS
ONE OF THE MOST CORRECT MEN IN ENGLAND, WOULD NOT HEAR OF IT."

"AN AFTERPIECE INSTEAD OF A COMEDY," SAID MR. BERTRAM. "LOVERS' VOWS
WERE AT AN END, AND LORD AND LADY RAVENSHAW LEFT TO ACT MY GRANDMOTHER
BY THEMSELVES. WELL, THE JOINTURE MAY COMFORT HIM; AND PERHAPS,
BETWEEN FRIENDS, HE BEGAN TO TREMBLE FOR HIS CREDIT AND HIS LUNGS IN THE
BARON, AND WAS NOT SORRY TO WITHDRAW; AND TO MAKE YOU AMENDS, YATES, I
THINK WE MUST RAISE A LITTLE THEATRE AT MANSFIELD, AND ASK YOU TO BE OUR
MANAGER."

THIS, THOUGH THE THOUGHT OF THE MOMENT, DID NOT END WITH THE MOMENT; FOR
THE INCLINATION TO ACT WAS AWAKENED, AND IN NO ONE MORE STRONGLY THAN IN
HIM WHO WAS NOW MASTER OF THE HOUSE; AND WHO, HAVING SO MUCH LEISURE AS
TO MAKE ALMOST ANY NOVELTY A CERTAIN GOOD, HAD LIKEWISE SUCH A DEGREE OF
LIVELY TALENTS AND COMIC TASTE, AS WERE EXACTLY ADAPTED TO THE NOVELTY
OF ACTING. THE THOUGHT RETURNED AGAIN AND AGAIN. "OH FOR THE ECCLESFORD
THEATRE AND SCENERY TO TRY SOMETHING WITH." EACH SISTER COULD ECHO THE
WISH; AND HENRY CRAWFORD, TO WHOM, IN ALL THE RIOT OF HIS GRATIFICATIONS
IT WAS YET AN UNTASTED PLEASURE, WAS QUITE ALIVE AT THE IDEA. "I REALLY
BELIEVE," SAID HE, "I COULD BE FOOL ENOUGH AT THIS MOMENT TO UNDERTAKE
ANY CHARACTER THAT EVER WAS WRITTEN, FROM SHYLOCK OR RICHARD III DOWN TO
THE SINGING HERO OF A FARCE IN HIS SCARLET COAT AND COCKED HAT. I FEEL
AS IF I COULD BE ANYTHING OR EVERYTHING; AS IF I COULD RANT AND STORM,
OR SIGH OR CUT CAPERS, IN ANY TRAGEDY OR COMEDY IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE.
LET US BE DOING SOMETHING. BE IT ONLY HALF A PLAY, AN ACT, A SCENE; WHAT
SHOULD PREVENT US? NOT THESE COUNTENANCES, I AM SURE," LOOKING TOWARDS
THE MISS BERTRAMS; "AND FOR A THEATRE, WHAT SIGNIFIES A THEATRE? WE
SHALL BE ONLY AMUSING OURSELVES. ANY ROOM IN THIS HOUSE MIGHT SUFFICE."

"WE MUST HAVE A CURTAIN," SAID TOM BERTRAM; "A FEW YARDS OF GREEN BAIZE
FOR A CURTAIN, AND PERHAPS THAT MAY BE ENOUGH."

"OH, QUITE ENOUGH," CRIED MR. YATES, "WITH ONLY JUST A SIDE WING OR TWO
RUN UP, DOORS IN FLAT, AND THREE OR FOUR SCENES TO BE LET DOWN; NOTHING
MORE WOULD BE NECESSARY ON SUCH A PLAN AS THIS. FOR MERE AMUSEMENT AMONG
OURSELVES WE SHOULD WANT NOTHING MORE."

"I BELIEVE WE MUST BE SATISFIED WITH LESS," SAID MARIA. "THERE WOULD
NOT BE TIME, AND OTHER DIFFICULTIES WOULD ARISE. WE MUST RATHER ADOPT
MR. CRAWFORD'S VIEWS, AND MAKE THE PERFORMANCE, NOT THE THEATRE, OUR
OBJECT. MANY PARTS OF OUR BEST PLAYS ARE INDEPENDENT OF SCENERY."

"NAY," SAID EDMUND, WHO BEGAN TO LISTEN WITH ALARM. "LET US DO NOTHING
BY HALVES. IF WE ARE TO ACT, LET IT BE IN A THEATRE COMPLETELY FITTED
UP WITH PIT, BOXES, AND GALLERY, AND LET US HAVE A PLAY ENTIRE FROM
BEGINNING TO END; SO AS IT BE A GERMAN PLAY, NO MATTER WHAT, WITH A GOOD
TRICKING, SHIFTING AFTERPIECE, AND A FIGURE-DANCE, AND A HORNPIPE, AND A
SONG BETWEEN THE ACTS. IF WE DO NOT OUTDO ECCLESFORD, WE DO NOTHING."

"NOW, EDMUND, DO NOT BE DISAGREEABLE," SAID JULIA. "NOBODY LOVES A PLAY
BETTER THAN YOU DO, OR CAN HAVE GONE MUCH FARTHER TO SEE ONE."

"TRUE, TO SEE REAL ACTING, GOOD HARDENED REAL ACTING; BUT I WOULD HARDLY
WALK FROM THIS ROOM TO THE NEXT TO LOOK AT THE RAW EFFORTS OF THOSE WHO
HAVE NOT BEEN BRED TO THE TRADE: A SET OF GENTLEMEN AND LADIES, WHO HAVE
ALL THE DISADVANTAGES OF EDUCATION AND DECORUM TO STRUGGLE THROUGH."

AFTER A SHORT PAUSE, HOWEVER, THE SUBJECT STILL CONTINUED, AND WAS
DISCUSSED WITH UNABATED EAGERNESS, EVERY ONE'S INCLINATION INCREASING
BY THE DISCUSSION, AND A KNOWLEDGE OF THE INCLINATION OF THE REST; AND
THOUGH NOTHING WAS SETTLED BUT THAT TOM BERTRAM WOULD PREFER A COMEDY,
AND HIS SISTERS AND HENRY CRAWFORD A TRAGEDY, AND THAT NOTHING IN THE
WORLD COULD BE EASIER THAN TO FIND A PIECE WHICH WOULD PLEASE THEM ALL,
THE RESOLUTION TO ACT SOMETHING OR OTHER SEEMED SO DECIDED AS TO
MAKE EDMUND QUITE UNCOMFORTABLE. HE WAS DETERMINED TO PREVENT IT, IF
POSSIBLE, THOUGH HIS MOTHER, WHO EQUALLY HEARD THE CONVERSATION WHICH
PASSED AT TABLE, DID NOT EVINCE THE LEAST DISAPPROBATION.

THE SAME EVENING AFFORDED HIM AN OPPORTUNITY OF TRYING HIS STRENGTH.
MARIA, JULIA, HENRY CRAWFORD, AND MR. YATES WERE IN THE BILLIARD-ROOM.
TOM, RETURNING FROM THEM INTO THE DRAWING-ROOM, WHERE EDMUND WAS
STANDING THOUGHTFULLY BY THE FIRE, WHILE LADY BERTRAM WAS ON THE SOFA AT
A LITTLE DISTANCE, AND FANNY CLOSE BESIDE HER ARRANGING HER WORK, THUS
BEGAN AS HE ENTERED--"SUCH A HORRIBLY VILE BILLIARD-TABLE AS OURS IS NOT
TO BE MET WITH, I BELIEVE, ABOVE GROUND. I CAN STAND IT NO LONGER, AND I
THINK, I MAY SAY, THAT NOTHING SHALL EVER TEMPT ME TO IT AGAIN; BUT ONE
GOOD THING I HAVE JUST ASCERTAINED: IT IS THE VERY ROOM FOR A THEATRE,
PRECISELY THE SHAPE AND LENGTH FOR IT; AND THE DOORS AT THE FARTHER
END, COMMUNICATING WITH EACH OTHER, AS THEY MAY BE MADE TO DO IN FIVE
MINUTES, BY MERELY MOVING THE BOOKCASE IN MY FATHER'S ROOM, IS THE VERY
THING WE COULD HAVE DESIRED, IF WE HAD SAT DOWN TO WISH FOR IT; AND
MY FATHER'S ROOM WILL BE AN EXCELLENT GREENROOM. IT SEEMS TO JOIN THE
BILLIARD-ROOM ON PURPOSE."

"YOU ARE NOT SERIOUS, TOM, IN MEANING TO ACT?" SAID EDMUND, IN A LOW
VOICE, AS HIS BROTHER APPROACHED THE FIRE.

"NOT SERIOUS! NEVER MORE SO, I ASSURE YOU. WHAT IS THERE TO SURPRISE YOU
IN IT?"

"I THINK IT WOULD BE VERY WRONG. IN A GENERAL LIGHT, PRIVATE
THEATRICALS ARE OPEN TO SOME OBJECTIONS, BUT AS WE ARE CIRCUMSTANCED,
I MUST THINK IT WOULD BE HIGHLY INJUDICIOUS, AND MORE THAN INJUDICIOUS
TO ATTEMPT ANYTHING OF THE KIND. IT WOULD SHEW GREAT WANT OF FEELING
ON MY FATHER'S ACCOUNT, ABSENT AS HE IS, AND IN SOME DEGREE OF CONSTANT
DANGER; AND IT WOULD BE IMPRUDENT, I THINK, WITH REGARD TO MARIA, WHOSE
SITUATION IS A VERY DELICATE ONE, CONSIDERING EVERYTHING, EXTREMELY
DELICATE."

"YOU TAKE UP A THING SO SERIOUSLY! AS IF WE WERE GOING TO ACT THREE
TIMES A WEEK TILL MY FATHER'S RETURN, AND INVITE ALL THE COUNTRY. BUT
IT IS NOT TO BE A DISPLAY OF THAT SORT. WE MEAN NOTHING BUT A LITTLE
AMUSEMENT AMONG OURSELVES, JUST TO VARY THE SCENE, AND EXERCISE OUR
POWERS IN SOMETHING NEW. WE WANT NO AUDIENCE, NO PUBLICITY. WE MAY BE
TRUSTED, I THINK, IN CHUSING SOME PLAY MOST PERFECTLY UNEXCEPTIONABLE;
AND I CAN CONCEIVE NO GREATER HARM OR DANGER TO ANY OF US IN CONVERSING
IN THE ELEGANT WRITTEN LANGUAGE OF SOME RESPECTABLE AUTHOR THAN IN
CHATTERING IN WORDS OF OUR OWN. I HAVE NO FEARS AND NO SCRUPLES. AND
AS TO MY FATHER'S BEING ABSENT, IT IS SO FAR FROM AN OBJECTION, THAT I
CONSIDER IT RATHER AS A MOTIVE; FOR THE EXPECTATION OF HIS RETURN MUST
BE A VERY ANXIOUS PERIOD TO MY MOTHER; AND IF WE CAN BE THE MEANS OF
AMUSING THAT ANXIETY, AND KEEPING UP HER SPIRITS FOR THE NEXT FEW WEEKS,
I SHALL THINK OUR TIME VERY WELL SPENT, AND SO, I AM SURE, WILL HE. IT
IS A VERY ANXIOUS PERIOD FOR HER."

AS HE SAID THIS, EACH LOOKED TOWARDS THEIR MOTHER. LADY BERTRAM, SUNK
BACK IN ONE CORNER OF THE SOFA, THE PICTURE OF HEALTH, WEALTH, EASE,
AND TRANQUILLITY, WAS JUST FALLING INTO A GENTLE DOZE, WHILE FANNY WAS
GETTING THROUGH THE FEW DIFFICULTIES OF HER WORK FOR HER.

EDMUND SMILED AND SHOOK HIS HEAD.

"BY JOVE! THIS WON'T DO," CRIED TOM, THROWING HIMSELF INTO A CHAIR WITH
A HEARTY LAUGH. "TO BE SURE, MY DEAR MOTHER, YOUR ANXIETY--I WAS UNLUCKY
THERE."

"WHAT IS THE MATTER?" ASKED HER LADYSHIP, IN THE HEAVY TONE OF ONE
HALF-ROUSED; "I WAS NOT ASLEEP."

"OH DEAR, NO, MA'AM, NOBODY SUSPECTED YOU! WELL, EDMUND," HE CONTINUED,
RETURNING TO THE FORMER SUBJECT, POSTURE, AND VOICE, AS SOON AS LADY
BERTRAM BEGAN TO NOD AGAIN, "BUT THIS I WILL MAINTAIN, THAT WE SHALL
BE DOING NO HARM."

"I CANNOT AGREE WITH YOU; I AM CONVINCED THAT MY FATHER WOULD TOTALLY
DISAPPROVE IT."

"AND I AM CONVINCED TO THE CONTRARY. NOBODY IS FONDER OF THE EXERCISE
OF TALENT IN YOUNG PEOPLE, OR PROMOTES IT MORE, THAN MY FATHER, AND FOR
ANYTHING OF THE ACTING, SPOUTING, RECITING KIND, I THINK HE HAS ALWAYS A
DECIDED TASTE. I AM SURE HE ENCOURAGED IT IN US AS BOYS. HOW MANY A TIME
HAVE WE MOURNED OVER THE DEAD BODY OF JULIUS CAESAR, AND TO BE'D AND
NOT TO BE'D, IN THIS VERY ROOM, FOR HIS AMUSEMENT? AND I AM SURE,
MY NAME WAS NORVAL, EVERY EVENING OF MY LIFE THROUGH ONE
CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS."

"IT WAS A VERY DIFFERENT THING. YOU MUST SEE THE DIFFERENCE YOURSELF. MY
FATHER WISHED US, AS SCHOOLBOYS, TO SPEAK WELL, BUT HE WOULD NEVER
WISH HIS GROWN-UP DAUGHTERS TO BE ACTING PLAYS. HIS SENSE OF DECORUM IS
STRICT."

"I KNOW ALL THAT," SAID TOM, DISPLEASED. "I KNOW MY FATHER AS WELL AS
YOU DO; AND I'LL TAKE CARE THAT HIS DAUGHTERS DO NOTHING TO DISTRESS
HIM. MANAGE YOUR OWN CONCERNS, EDMUND, AND I'LL TAKE CARE OF THE REST OF
THE FAMILY."

"IF YOU ARE RESOLVED ON ACTING," REPLIED THE PERSEVERING EDMUND, "I MUST
HOPE IT WILL BE IN A VERY SMALL AND QUIET WAY; AND I THINK A THEATRE
OUGHT NOT TO BE ATTEMPTED. IT WOULD BE TAKING LIBERTIES WITH MY FATHER'S
HOUSE IN HIS ABSENCE WHICH COULD NOT BE JUSTIFIED."

"FOR EVERYTHING OF THAT NATURE I WILL BE ANSWERABLE," SAID TOM, IN A
DECIDED TONE. "HIS HOUSE SHALL NOT BE HURT. I HAVE QUITE AS GREAT AN
INTEREST IN BEING CAREFUL OF HIS HOUSE AS YOU CAN HAVE; AND AS TO SUCH
ALTERATIONS AS I WAS SUGGESTING JUST NOW, SUCH AS MOVING A BOOKCASE, OR
UNLOCKING A DOOR, OR EVEN AS USING THE BILLIARD-ROOM FOR THE SPACE OF A
WEEK WITHOUT PLAYING AT BILLIARDS IN IT, YOU MIGHT JUST AS WELL SUPPOSE
HE WOULD OBJECT TO OUR SITTING MORE IN THIS ROOM, AND LESS IN THE
BREAKFAST-ROOM, THAN WE DID BEFORE HE WENT AWAY, OR TO MY SISTER'S
PIANOFORTE BEING MOVED FROM ONE SIDE OF THE ROOM TO THE OTHER. ABSOLUTE
NONSENSE!"

"THE INNOVATION, IF NOT WRONG AS AN INNOVATION, WILL BE WRONG AS AN
EXPENSE."

"YES, THE EXPENSE OF SUCH AN UNDERTAKING WOULD BE PRODIGIOUS! PERHAPS
IT MIGHT COST A WHOLE TWENTY POUNDS. SOMETHING OF A THEATRE WE MUST HAVE
UNDOUBTEDLY, BUT IT WILL BE ON THE SIMPLEST PLAN: A GREEN CURTAIN AND A
LITTLE CARPENTER'S WORK, AND THAT'S ALL; AND AS THE CARPENTER'S WORK
MAY BE ALL DONE AT HOME BY CHRISTOPHER JACKSON HIMSELF, IT WILL BE
TOO ABSURD TO TALK OF EXPENSE; AND AS LONG AS JACKSON IS EMPLOYED,
EVERYTHING WILL BE RIGHT WITH SIR THOMAS. DON'T IMAGINE THAT NOBODY IN
THIS HOUSE CAN SEE OR JUDGE BUT YOURSELF. DON'T ACT YOURSELF, IF YOU DO
NOT LIKE IT, BUT DON'T EXPECT TO GOVERN EVERYBODY ELSE."

"NO, AS TO ACTING MYSELF," SAID EDMUND, "THAT I ABSOLUTELY PROTEST
AGAINST."

TOM WALKED OUT OF THE ROOM AS HE SAID IT, AND EDMUND WAS LEFT TO SIT
DOWN AND STIR THE FIRE IN THOUGHTFUL VEXATION.

FANNY, WHO HAD HEARD IT ALL, AND BORNE EDMUND COMPANY IN EVERY FEELING
THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE, NOW VENTURED TO SAY, IN HER ANXIETY TO SUGGEST
SOME COMFORT, "PERHAPS THEY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO FIND ANY PLAY TO SUIT
THEM. YOUR BROTHER'S TASTE AND YOUR SISTERS' SEEM VERY DIFFERENT."

"I HAVE NO HOPE THERE, FANNY. IF THEY PERSIST IN THE SCHEME, THEY WILL
FIND SOMETHING. I SHALL SPEAK TO MY SISTERS AND TRY TO DISSUADE THEM,
AND THAT IS ALL I CAN DO."

"I SHOULD THINK MY AUNT NORRIS WOULD BE ON YOUR SIDE."

"I DARE SAY SHE WOULD, BUT SHE HAS NO INFLUENCE WITH EITHER TOM OR MY
SISTERS THAT COULD BE OF ANY USE; AND IF I CANNOT CONVINCE THEM MYSELF,
I SHALL LET THINGS TAKE THEIR COURSE, WITHOUT ATTEMPTING IT THROUGH
HER. FAMILY SQUABBLING IS THE GREATEST EVIL OF ALL, AND WE HAD BETTER DO
ANYTHING THAN BE ALTOGETHER BY THE EARS."

HIS SISTERS, TO WHOM HE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY OF SPEAKING THE NEXT MORNING,
WERE QUITE AS IMPATIENT OF HIS ADVICE, QUITE AS UNYIELDING TO HIS
REPRESENTATION, QUITE AS DETERMINED IN THE CAUSE OF PLEASURE, AS TOM.
THEIR MOTHER HAD NO OBJECTION TO THE PLAN, AND THEY WERE NOT IN THE
LEAST AFRAID OF THEIR FATHER'S DISAPPROBATION. THERE COULD BE NO HARM IN
WHAT HAD BEEN DONE IN SO MANY RESPECTABLE FAMILIES, AND BY SO MANY WOMEN
OF THE FIRST CONSIDERATION; AND IT MUST BE SCRUPULOUSNESS RUN MAD THAT
COULD SEE ANYTHING TO CENSURE IN A PLAN LIKE THEIRS, COMPREHENDING ONLY
BROTHERS AND SISTERS AND INTIMATE FRIENDS, AND WHICH WOULD NEVER BE
HEARD OF BEYOND THEMSELVES. JULIA DID SEEM INCLINED TO ADMIT THAT
MARIA'S SITUATION MIGHT REQUIRE PARTICULAR CAUTION AND DELICACY--BUT
THAT COULD NOT EXTEND TO HER--SHE WAS AT LIBERTY; AND MARIA EVIDENTLY
CONSIDERED HER ENGAGEMENT AS ONLY RAISING HER SO MUCH MORE ABOVE
RESTRAINT, AND LEAVING HER LESS OCCASION THAN JULIA TO CONSULT EITHER
FATHER OR MOTHER. EDMUND HAD LITTLE TO HOPE, BUT HE WAS STILL URGING THE
SUBJECT WHEN HENRY CRAWFORD ENTERED THE ROOM, FRESH FROM THE PARSONAGE,
CALLING OUT, "NO WANT OF HANDS IN OUR THEATRE, MISS BERTRAM. NO WANT
OF UNDERSTRAPPERS: MY SISTER DESIRES HER LOVE, AND HOPES TO BE ADMITTED
INTO THE COMPANY, AND WILL BE HAPPY TO TAKE THE PART OF ANY OLD DUENNA
OR TAME CONFIDANTE, THAT YOU MAY NOT LIKE TO DO YOURSELVES."

MARIA GAVE EDMUND A GLANCE, WHICH MEANT, "WHAT SAY YOU NOW? CAN WE
BE WRONG IF MARY CRAWFORD FEELS THE SAME?" AND EDMUND, SILENCED,
WAS OBLIGED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE CHARM OF ACTING MIGHT WELL CARRY
FASCINATION TO THE MIND OF GENIUS; AND WITH THE INGENUITY OF LOVE, TO
DWELL MORE ON THE OBLIGING, ACCOMMODATING PURPORT OF THE MESSAGE THAN ON
ANYTHING ELSE.

THE SCHEME ADVANCED. OPPOSITION WAS VAIN; AND AS TO MRS. NORRIS, HE
WAS MISTAKEN IN SUPPOSING SHE WOULD WISH TO MAKE ANY. SHE STARTED NO
DIFFICULTIES THAT WERE NOT TALKED DOWN IN FIVE MINUTES BY HER ELDEST
NEPHEW AND NIECE, WHO WERE ALL-POWERFUL WITH HER; AND AS THE WHOLE
ARRANGEMENT WAS TO BRING VERY LITTLE EXPENSE TO ANYBODY, AND NONE AT ALL
TO HERSELF, AS SHE FORESAW IN IT ALL THE COMFORTS OF HURRY, BUSTLE,
AND IMPORTANCE, AND DERIVED THE IMMEDIATE ADVANTAGE OF FANCYING HERSELF
OBLIGED TO LEAVE HER OWN HOUSE, WHERE SHE HAD BEEN LIVING A MONTH AT
HER OWN COST, AND TAKE UP HER ABODE IN THEIRS, THAT EVERY HOUR MIGHT BE
SPENT IN THEIR SERVICE, SHE WAS, IN FACT, EXCEEDINGLY DELIGHTED WITH THE
PROJECT.



CHAPTER XIV

FANNY SEEMED NEARER BEING RIGHT THAN EDMUND HAD SUPPOSED. THE BUSINESS
OF FINDING A PLAY THAT WOULD SUIT EVERYBODY PROVED TO BE NO TRIFLE; AND
THE CARPENTER HAD RECEIVED HIS ORDERS AND TAKEN HIS MEASUREMENTS, HAD
SUGGESTED AND REMOVED AT LEAST TWO SETS OF DIFFICULTIES, AND HAVING MADE
THE NECESSITY OF AN ENLARGEMENT OF PLAN AND EXPENSE FULLY EVIDENT, WAS
ALREADY AT WORK, WHILE A PLAY WAS STILL TO SEEK. OTHER PREPARATIONS
WERE ALSO IN HAND. AN ENORMOUS ROLL OF GREEN BAIZE HAD ARRIVED FROM
NORTHAMPTON, AND BEEN CUT OUT BY MRS. NORRIS (WITH A SAVING BY HER GOOD
MANAGEMENT OF FULL THREE-QUARTERS OF A YARD), AND WAS ACTUALLY FORMING
INTO A CURTAIN BY THE HOUSEMAIDS, AND STILL THE PLAY WAS WANTING; AND
AS TWO OR THREE DAYS PASSED AWAY IN THIS MANNER, EDMUND BEGAN ALMOST TO
HOPE THAT NONE MIGHT EVER BE FOUND.

THERE WERE, IN FACT, SO MANY THINGS TO BE ATTENDED TO, SO MANY PEOPLE
TO BE PLEASED, SO MANY BEST CHARACTERS REQUIRED, AND, ABOVE ALL, SUCH A
NEED THAT THE PLAY SHOULD BE AT ONCE BOTH TRAGEDY AND COMEDY, THAT THERE
DID SEEM AS LITTLE CHANCE OF A DECISION AS ANYTHING PURSUED BY YOUTH AND
ZEAL COULD HOLD OUT.

ON THE TRAGIC SIDE WERE THE MISS BERTRAMS, HENRY CRAWFORD, AND MR.
YATES; ON THE COMIC, TOM BERTRAM, NOT QUITE ALONE, BECAUSE IT WAS
EVIDENT THAT MARY CRAWFORD'S WISHES, THOUGH POLITELY KEPT BACK, INCLINED
THE SAME WAY: BUT HIS DETERMINATENESS AND HIS POWER SEEMED TO MAKE
ALLIES UNNECESSARY; AND, INDEPENDENT OF THIS GREAT IRRECONCILABLE
DIFFERENCE, THEY WANTED A PIECE CONTAINING VERY FEW CHARACTERS IN THE
WHOLE, BUT EVERY CHARACTER FIRST-RATE, AND THREE PRINCIPAL WOMEN. ALL
THE BEST PLAYS WERE RUN OVER IN VAIN. NEITHER HAMLET, NOR MACBETH, NOR
OTHELLO, NOR DOUGLAS, NOR THE GAMESTER, PRESENTED ANYTHING THAT COULD
SATISFY EVEN THE TRAGEDIANS; AND THE RIVALS, THE SCHOOL FOR SCANDAL,
WHEEL OF FORTUNE, HEIR AT LAW, AND A LONG ET CETERA, WERE SUCCESSIVELY
DISMISSED WITH YET WARMER OBJECTIONS. NO PIECE COULD BE PROPOSED THAT
DID NOT SUPPLY SOMEBODY WITH A DIFFICULTY, AND ON ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER
IT WAS A CONTINUAL REPETITION OF, "OH NO, THAT WILL NEVER DO! LET US
HAVE NO RANTING TRAGEDIES. TOO MANY CHARACTERS. NOT A TOLERABLE
WOMAN'S PART IN THE PLAY. ANYTHING BUT THAT, MY DEAR TOM. IT WOULD BE
IMPOSSIBLE TO FILL IT UP. ONE COULD NOT EXPECT ANYBODY TO TAKE SUCH A
PART. NOTHING BUT BUFFOONERY FROM BEGINNING TO END. THAT MIGHT DO,
PERHAPS, BUT FOR THE LOW PARTS. IF I MUST GIVE MY OPINION, I HAVE
ALWAYS THOUGHT IT THE MOST INSIPID PLAY IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE. I DO
NOT WISH TO MAKE OBJECTIONS; I SHALL BE HAPPY TO BE OF ANY USE, BUT I
THINK WE COULD NOT CHUSE WORSE."

FANNY LOOKED ON AND LISTENED, NOT UNAMUSED TO OBSERVE THE SELFISHNESS
WHICH, MORE OR LESS DISGUISED, SEEMED TO GOVERN THEM ALL, AND WONDERING
HOW IT WOULD END. FOR HER OWN GRATIFICATION SHE COULD HAVE WISHED THAT
SOMETHING MIGHT BE ACTED, FOR SHE HAD NEVER SEEN EVEN HALF A PLAY, BUT
EVERYTHING OF HIGHER CONSEQUENCE WAS AGAINST IT.

"THIS WILL NEVER DO," SAID TOM BERTRAM AT LAST. "WE ARE WASTING TIME
MOST ABOMINABLY. SOMETHING MUST BE FIXED ON. NO MATTER WHAT, SO THAT
SOMETHING IS CHOSEN. WE MUST NOT BE SO NICE. A FEW CHARACTERS TOO MANY
MUST NOT FRIGHTEN US. WE MUST DOUBLE THEM. WE MUST DESCEND A LITTLE.
IF A PART IS INSIGNIFICANT, THE GREATER OUR CREDIT IN MAKING ANYTHING OF
IT. FROM THIS MOMENT I MAKE NO DIFFICULTIES. I TAKE ANY PART YOU CHUSE
TO GIVE ME, SO AS IT BE COMIC. LET IT BUT BE COMIC, I CONDITION FOR
NOTHING MORE."

FOR ABOUT THE FIFTH TIME HE THEN PROPOSED THE HEIR AT LAW, DOUBTING ONLY
WHETHER TO PREFER LORD DUBERLEY OR DR. PANGLOSS FOR HIMSELF; AND VERY
EARNESTLY, BUT VERY UNSUCCESSFULLY, TRYING TO PERSUADE THE OTHERS THAT
THERE WERE SOME FINE TRAGIC PARTS IN THE REST OF THE DRAMATIS PERSONAE.

THE PAUSE WHICH FOLLOWED THIS FRUITLESS EFFORT WAS ENDED BY THE SAME
SPEAKER, WHO, TAKING UP ONE OF THE MANY VOLUMES OF PLAYS THAT LAY ON THE
TABLE, AND TURNING IT OVER, SUDDENLY EXCLAIMED--"LOVERS' VOWS! AND WHY
SHOULD NOT LOVERS' VOWS DO FOR US AS WELL AS FOR THE RAVENSHAWS? HOW
CAME IT NEVER TO BE THOUGHT OF BEFORE? IT STRIKES ME AS IF IT WOULD DO
EXACTLY. WHAT SAY YOU ALL? HERE ARE TWO CAPITAL TRAGIC PARTS FOR YATES
AND CRAWFORD, AND HERE IS THE RHYMING BUTLER FOR ME, IF NOBODY ELSE
WANTS IT; A TRIFLING PART, BUT THE SORT OF THING I SHOULD NOT DISLIKE,
AND, AS I SAID BEFORE, I AM DETERMINED TO TAKE ANYTHING AND DO MY BEST.
AND AS FOR THE REST, THEY MAY BE FILLED UP BY ANYBODY. IT IS ONLY COUNT
CASSEL AND ANHALT."

THE SUGGESTION WAS GENERALLY WELCOME. EVERYBODY WAS GROWING WEARY OF
INDECISION, AND THE FIRST IDEA WITH EVERYBODY WAS, THAT NOTHING HAD BEEN
PROPOSED BEFORE SO LIKELY TO SUIT THEM ALL. MR. YATES WAS PARTICULARLY
PLEASED: HE HAD BEEN SIGHING AND LONGING TO DO THE BARON AT ECCLESFORD,
HAD GRUDGED EVERY RANT OF LORD RAVENSHAW'S, AND BEEN FORCED TO RE-RANT
IT ALL IN HIS OWN ROOM. THE STORM THROUGH BARON WILDENHEIM WAS THE
HEIGHT OF HIS THEATRICAL AMBITION; AND WITH THE ADVANTAGE OF KNOWING
HALF THE SCENES BY HEART ALREADY, HE DID NOW, WITH THE GREATEST
ALACRITY, OFFER HIS SERVICES FOR THE PART. TO DO HIM JUSTICE, HOWEVER,
HE DID NOT RESOLVE TO APPROPRIATE IT; FOR REMEMBERING THAT THERE WAS
SOME VERY GOOD RANTING-GROUND IN FREDERICK, HE PROFESSED AN EQUAL
WILLINGNESS FOR THAT. HENRY CRAWFORD WAS READY TO TAKE EITHER. WHICHEVER
MR. YATES DID NOT CHUSE WOULD PERFECTLY SATISFY HIM, AND A SHORT PARLEY
OF COMPLIMENT ENSUED. MISS BERTRAM, FEELING ALL THE INTEREST OF AN
AGATHA IN THE QUESTION, TOOK ON HER TO DECIDE IT, BY OBSERVING TO MR.
YATES THAT THIS WAS A POINT IN WHICH HEIGHT AND FIGURE OUGHT TO
BE CONSIDERED, AND THAT HIS BEING THE TALLEST, SEEMED TO FIT HIM
PECULIARLY FOR THE BARON. SHE WAS ACKNOWLEDGED TO BE QUITE RIGHT, AND
THE TWO PARTS BEING ACCEPTED ACCORDINGLY, SHE WAS CERTAIN OF THE PROPER
FREDERICK. THREE OF THE CHARACTERS WERE NOW CAST, BESIDES MR. RUSHWORTH,
WHO WAS ALWAYS ANSWERED FOR BY MARIA AS WILLING TO DO ANYTHING; WHEN
JULIA, MEANING, LIKE HER SISTER, TO BE AGATHA, BEGAN TO BE SCRUPULOUS ON
MISS CRAWFORD'S ACCOUNT.

"THIS IS NOT BEHAVING WELL BY THE ABSENT," SAID SHE. "HERE ARE NOT WOMEN
ENOUGH. AMELIA AND AGATHA MAY DO FOR MARIA AND ME, BUT HERE IS NOTHING
FOR YOUR SISTER, MR. CRAWFORD."

MR. CRAWFORD DESIRED THAT MIGHT NOT BE THOUGHT OF: HE WAS VERY SURE
HIS SISTER HAD NO WISH OF ACTING BUT AS SHE MIGHT BE USEFUL, AND THAT
SHE WOULD NOT ALLOW HERSELF TO BE CONSIDERED IN THE PRESENT CASE. BUT
THIS WAS IMMEDIATELY OPPOSED BY TOM BERTRAM, WHO ASSERTED THE PART OF
AMELIA TO BE IN EVERY RESPECT THE PROPERTY OF MISS CRAWFORD, IF SHE
WOULD ACCEPT IT. "IT FALLS AS NATURALLY, AS NECESSARILY TO HER,"
SAID HE, "AS AGATHA DOES TO ONE OR OTHER OF MY SISTERS. IT CAN BE NO
SACRIFICE ON THEIR SIDE, FOR IT IS HIGHLY COMIC."

A SHORT SILENCE FOLLOWED. EACH SISTER LOOKED ANXIOUS; FOR EACH FELT THE
BEST CLAIM TO AGATHA, AND WAS HOPING TO HAVE IT PRESSED ON HER BY THE
REST. HENRY CRAWFORD, WHO MEANWHILE HAD TAKEN UP THE PLAY, AND WITH
SEEMING CARELESSNESS WAS TURNING OVER THE FIRST ACT, SOON SETTLED THE
BUSINESS.

"I MUST ENTREAT MISS JULIA BERTRAM," SAID HE, "NOT TO ENGAGE IN THE
PART OF AGATHA, OR IT WILL BE THE RUIN OF ALL MY SOLEMNITY. YOU MUST
NOT, INDEED YOU MUST NOT" (TURNING TO HER). "I COULD NOT STAND YOUR
COUNTENANCE DRESSED UP IN WOE AND PALENESS. THE MANY LAUGHS WE HAVE HAD
TOGETHER WOULD INFALLIBLY COME ACROSS ME, AND FREDERICK AND HIS KNAPSACK
WOULD BE OBLIGED TO RUN AWAY."

PLEASANTLY, COURTEOUSLY, IT WAS SPOKEN; BUT THE MANNER WAS LOST IN THE
MATTER TO JULIA'S FEELINGS. SHE SAW A GLANCE AT MARIA WHICH CONFIRMED
THE INJURY TO HERSELF: IT WAS A SCHEME, A TRICK; SHE WAS SLIGHTED, MARIA
WAS PREFERRED; THE SMILE OF TRIUMPH WHICH MARIA WAS TRYING TO SUPPRESS
SHEWED HOW WELL IT WAS UNDERSTOOD; AND BEFORE JULIA COULD COMMAND
HERSELF ENOUGH TO SPEAK, HER BROTHER GAVE HIS WEIGHT AGAINST HER TOO,
BY SAYING, "OH YES! MARIA MUST BE AGATHA. MARIA WILL BE THE BEST AGATHA.
THOUGH JULIA FANCIES SHE PREFERS TRAGEDY, I WOULD NOT TRUST HER IN IT.
THERE IS NOTHING OF TRAGEDY ABOUT HER. SHE HAS NOT THE LOOK OF IT. HER
FEATURES ARE NOT TRAGIC FEATURES, AND SHE WALKS TOO QUICK, AND SPEAKS
TOO QUICK, AND WOULD NOT KEEP HER COUNTENANCE. SHE HAD BETTER DO THE OLD
COUNTRYWOMAN: THE COTTAGER'S WIFE; YOU HAD, INDEED, JULIA. COTTAGER'S
WIFE IS A VERY PRETTY PART, I ASSURE YOU. THE OLD LADY RELIEVES THE
HIGH-FLOWN BENEVOLENCE OF HER HUSBAND WITH A GOOD DEAL OF SPIRIT. YOU
SHALL BE COTTAGER'S WIFE."

"COTTAGER'S WIFE!" CRIED MR. YATES. "WHAT ARE YOU TALKING OF? THE MOST
TRIVIAL, PALTRY, INSIGNIFICANT PART; THE MEREST COMMONPLACE; NOT A
TOLERABLE SPEECH IN THE WHOLE. YOUR SISTER DO THAT! IT IS AN INSULT
TO PROPOSE IT. AT ECCLESFORD THE GOVERNESS WAS TO HAVE DONE IT. WE
ALL AGREED THAT IT COULD NOT BE OFFERED TO ANYBODY ELSE. A LITTLE MORE
JUSTICE, MR. MANAGER, IF YOU PLEASE. YOU DO NOT DESERVE THE OFFICE, IF
YOU CANNOT APPRECIATE THE TALENTS OF YOUR COMPANY A LITTLE BETTER."

"WHY, AS TO THAT, MY GOOD FRIEND, TILL I AND MY COMPANY HAVE REALLY
ACTED THERE MUST BE SOME GUESSWORK; BUT I MEAN NO DISPARAGEMENT TO
JULIA. WE CANNOT HAVE TWO AGATHAS, AND WE MUST HAVE ONE COTTAGER'S
WIFE; AND I AM SURE I SET HER THE EXAMPLE OF MODERATION MYSELF IN BEING
SATISFIED WITH THE OLD BUTLER. IF THE PART IS TRIFLING SHE WILL HAVE
MORE CREDIT IN MAKING SOMETHING OF IT; AND IF SHE IS SO DESPERATELY BENT
AGAINST EVERYTHING HUMOROUS, LET HER TAKE COTTAGER'S SPEECHES INSTEAD OF
COTTAGER'S WIFE'S, AND SO CHANGE THE PARTS ALL THROUGH; HE IS SOLEMN
AND PATHETIC ENOUGH, I AM SURE. IT COULD MAKE NO DIFFERENCE IN THE PLAY,
AND AS FOR COTTAGER HIMSELF, WHEN HE HAS GOT HIS WIFE'S SPEECHES, I
WOULD UNDERTAKE HIM WITH ALL MY HEART."

"WITH ALL YOUR PARTIALITY FOR COTTAGER'S WIFE," SAID HENRY CRAWFORD, "IT
WILL BE IMPOSSIBLE TO MAKE ANYTHING OF IT FIT FOR YOUR SISTER, AND WE
MUST NOT SUFFER HER GOOD-NATURE TO BE IMPOSED ON. WE MUST NOT ALLOW
HER TO ACCEPT THE PART. SHE MUST NOT BE LEFT TO HER OWN COMPLAISANCE.
HER TALENTS WILL BE WANTED IN AMELIA. AMELIA IS A CHARACTER MORE
DIFFICULT TO BE WELL REPRESENTED THAN EVEN AGATHA. I CONSIDER AMELIA
IS THE MOST DIFFICULT CHARACTER IN THE WHOLE PIECE. IT REQUIRES GREAT
POWERS, GREAT NICETY, TO GIVE HER PLAYFULNESS AND SIMPLICITY WITHOUT
EXTRAVAGANCE. I HAVE SEEN GOOD ACTRESSES FAIL IN THE PART. SIMPLICITY,
INDEED, IS BEYOND THE REACH OF ALMOST EVERY ACTRESS BY PROFESSION.
IT REQUIRES A DELICACY OF FEELING WHICH THEY HAVE NOT. IT REQUIRES A
GENTLEWOMAN--A JULIA BERTRAM. YOU WILL UNDERTAKE IT, I HOPE?" TURNING
TO HER WITH A LOOK OF ANXIOUS ENTREATY, WHICH SOFTENED HER A LITTLE; BUT
WHILE SHE HESITATED WHAT TO SAY, HER BROTHER AGAIN INTERPOSED WITH MISS
CRAWFORD'S BETTER CLAIM.

"NO, NO, JULIA MUST NOT BE AMELIA. IT IS NOT AT ALL THE PART FOR HER.
SHE WOULD NOT LIKE IT. SHE WOULD NOT DO WELL. SHE IS TOO TALL AND
ROBUST. AMELIA SHOULD BE A SMALL, LIGHT, GIRLISH, SKIPPING FIGURE. IT IS
FIT FOR MISS CRAWFORD, AND MISS CRAWFORD ONLY. SHE LOOKS THE PART, AND I
AM PERSUADED WILL DO IT ADMIRABLY."

WITHOUT ATTENDING TO THIS, HENRY CRAWFORD CONTINUED HIS SUPPLICATION.
"YOU MUST OBLIGE US," SAID HE, "INDEED YOU MUST. WHEN YOU HAVE STUDIED
THE CHARACTER, I AM SURE YOU WILL FEEL IT SUIT YOU. TRAGEDY MAY BE YOUR
CHOICE, BUT IT WILL CERTAINLY APPEAR THAT COMEDY CHUSES YOU. YOU
WILL BE TO VISIT ME IN PRISON WITH A BASKET OF PROVISIONS; YOU WILL
NOT REFUSE TO VISIT ME IN PRISON? I THINK I SEE YOU COMING IN WITH YOUR
BASKET."

THE INFLUENCE OF HIS VOICE WAS FELT. JULIA WAVERED; BUT WAS HE ONLY
TRYING TO SOOTHE AND PACIFY HER, AND MAKE HER OVERLOOK THE PREVIOUS
AFFRONT? SHE DISTRUSTED HIM. THE SLIGHT HAD BEEN MOST DETERMINED. HE
WAS, PERHAPS, BUT AT TREACHEROUS PLAY WITH HER. SHE LOOKED SUSPICIOUSLY
AT HER SISTER; MARIA'S COUNTENANCE WAS TO DECIDE IT: IF SHE WERE VEXED
AND ALARMED--BUT MARIA LOOKED ALL SERENITY AND SATISFACTION, AND JULIA
WELL KNEW THAT ON THIS GROUND MARIA COULD NOT BE HAPPY BUT AT HER
EXPENSE. WITH HASTY INDIGNATION, THEREFORE, AND A TREMULOUS VOICE, SHE
SAID TO HIM, "YOU DO NOT SEEM AFRAID OF NOT KEEPING YOUR COUNTENANCE
WHEN I COME IN WITH A BASKET OF PROVISIONS--THOUGH ONE MIGHT HAVE
SUPPOSED--BUT IT IS ONLY AS AGATHA THAT I WAS TO BE SO OVERPOWERING!"
SHE STOPPED--HENRY CRAWFORD LOOKED RATHER FOOLISH, AND AS IF HE DID NOT
KNOW WHAT TO SAY. TOM BERTRAM BEGAN AGAIN--

"MISS CRAWFORD MUST BE AMELIA. SHE WILL BE AN EXCELLENT AMELIA."

"DO NOT BE AFRAID OF MY WANTING THE CHARACTER," CRIED JULIA, WITH
ANGRY QUICKNESS: "I AM NOT TO BE AGATHA, AND I AM SURE I WILL DO
NOTHING ELSE; AND AS TO AMELIA, IT IS OF ALL PARTS IN THE WORLD THE
MOST DISGUSTING TO ME. I QUITE DETEST HER. AN ODIOUS, LITTLE, PERT,
UNNATURAL, IMPUDENT GIRL. I HAVE ALWAYS PROTESTED AGAINST COMEDY, AND
THIS IS COMEDY IN ITS WORST FORM." AND SO SAYING, SHE WALKED HASTILY
OUT OF THE ROOM, LEAVING AWKWARD FEELINGS TO MORE THAN ONE, BUT EXCITING
SMALL COMPASSION IN ANY EXCEPT FANNY, WHO HAD BEEN A QUIET AUDITOR OF
THE WHOLE, AND WHO COULD NOT THINK OF HER AS UNDER THE AGITATIONS OF
JEALOUSY WITHOUT GREAT PITY.

A SHORT SILENCE SUCCEEDED HER LEAVING THEM; BUT HER BROTHER SOON
RETURNED TO BUSINESS AND LOVERS' VOWS, AND WAS EAGERLY LOOKING OVER
THE PLAY, WITH MR. YATES'S HELP, TO ASCERTAIN WHAT SCENERY WOULD BE
NECESSARY--WHILE MARIA AND HENRY CRAWFORD CONVERSED TOGETHER IN AN
UNDER-VOICE, AND THE DECLARATION WITH WHICH SHE BEGAN OF, "I AM SURE I
WOULD GIVE UP THE PART TO JULIA MOST WILLINGLY, BUT THAT THOUGH I SHALL
PROBABLY DO IT VERY ILL, I FEEL PERSUADED SHE WOULD DO IT WORSE," WAS
DOUBTLESS RECEIVING ALL THE COMPLIMENTS IT CALLED FOR.

WHEN THIS HAD LASTED SOME TIME, THE DIVISION OF THE PARTY WAS COMPLETED
BY TOM BERTRAM AND MR. YATES WALKING OFF TOGETHER TO CONSULT FARTHER IN
THE ROOM NOW BEGINNING TO BE CALLED THE THEATRE, AND MISS BERTRAM'S
RESOLVING TO GO DOWN TO THE PARSONAGE HERSELF WITH THE OFFER OF AMELIA
TO MISS CRAWFORD; AND FANNY REMAINED ALONE.

THE FIRST USE SHE MADE OF HER SOLITUDE WAS TO TAKE UP THE VOLUME WHICH
HAD BEEN LEFT ON THE TABLE, AND BEGIN TO ACQUAINT HERSELF WITH THE PLAY
OF WHICH SHE HAD HEARD SO MUCH. HER CURIOSITY WAS ALL AWAKE, AND SHE RAN
THROUGH IT WITH AN EAGERNESS WHICH WAS SUSPENDED ONLY BY INTERVALS OF
ASTONISHMENT, THAT IT COULD BE CHOSEN IN THE PRESENT INSTANCE, THAT IT
COULD BE PROPOSED AND ACCEPTED IN A PRIVATE THEATRE! AGATHA AND AMELIA
APPEARED TO HER IN THEIR DIFFERENT WAYS SO TOTALLY IMPROPER FOR HOME
REPRESENTATION--THE SITUATION OF ONE, AND THE LANGUAGE OF THE OTHER,
SO UNFIT TO BE EXPRESSED BY ANY WOMAN OF MODESTY, THAT SHE COULD HARDLY
SUPPOSE HER COUSINS COULD BE AWARE OF WHAT THEY WERE ENGAGING IN; AND
LONGED TO HAVE THEM ROUSED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE BY THE REMONSTRANCE WHICH
EDMUND WOULD CERTAINLY MAKE.



CHAPTER XV

MISS CRAWFORD ACCEPTED THE PART VERY READILY; AND SOON AFTER MISS
BERTRAM'S RETURN FROM THE PARSONAGE, MR. RUSHWORTH ARRIVED, AND ANOTHER
CHARACTER WAS CONSEQUENTLY CAST. HE HAD THE OFFER OF COUNT CASSEL
AND ANHALT, AND AT FIRST DID NOT KNOW WHICH TO CHUSE, AND WANTED MISS
BERTRAM TO DIRECT HIM; BUT UPON BEING MADE TO UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENT
STYLE OF THE CHARACTERS, AND WHICH WAS WHICH, AND RECOLLECTING THAT HE
HAD ONCE SEEN THE PLAY IN LONDON, AND HAD THOUGHT ANHALT A VERY STUPID
FELLOW, HE SOON DECIDED FOR THE COUNT. MISS BERTRAM APPROVED THE
DECISION, FOR THE LESS HE HAD TO LEARN THE BETTER; AND THOUGH SHE COULD
NOT SYMPATHISE IN HIS WISH THAT THE COUNT AND AGATHA MIGHT BE TO ACT
TOGETHER, NOR WAIT VERY PATIENTLY WHILE HE WAS SLOWLY TURNING OVER THE
LEAVES WITH THE HOPE OF STILL DISCOVERING SUCH A SCENE, SHE VERY KINDLY
TOOK HIS PART IN HAND, AND CURTAILED EVERY SPEECH THAT ADMITTED BEING
SHORTENED; BESIDES POINTING OUT THE NECESSITY OF HIS BEING VERY MUCH
DRESSED, AND CHUSING HIS COLOURS. MR. RUSHWORTH LIKED THE IDEA OF HIS
FINERY VERY WELL, THOUGH AFFECTING TO DESPISE IT; AND WAS TOO MUCH
ENGAGED WITH WHAT HIS OWN APPEARANCE WOULD BE TO THINK OF THE OTHERS,
OR DRAW ANY OF THOSE CONCLUSIONS, OR FEEL ANY OF THAT DISPLEASURE WHICH
MARIA HAD BEEN HALF PREPARED FOR.

THUS MUCH WAS SETTLED BEFORE EDMUND, WHO HAD BEEN OUT ALL THE MORNING,
KNEW ANYTHING OF THE MATTER; BUT WHEN HE ENTERED THE DRAWING-ROOM BEFORE
DINNER, THE BUZZ OF DISCUSSION WAS HIGH BETWEEN TOM, MARIA, AND MR.
YATES; AND MR. RUSHWORTH STEPPED FORWARD WITH GREAT ALACRITY TO TELL HIM
THE AGREEABLE NEWS.

"WE HAVE GOT A PLAY," SAID HE. "IT IS TO BE LOVERS' VOWS; AND I AM TO BE
COUNT CASSEL, AND AM TO COME IN FIRST WITH A BLUE DRESS AND A PINK SATIN
CLOAK, AND AFTERWARDS AM TO HAVE ANOTHER FINE FANCY SUIT, BY WAY OF A
SHOOTING-DRESS. I DO NOT KNOW HOW I SHALL LIKE IT."

FANNY'S EYES FOLLOWED EDMUND, AND HER HEART BEAT FOR HIM AS SHE HEARD
THIS SPEECH, AND SAW HIS LOOK, AND FELT WHAT HIS SENSATIONS MUST BE.

"LOVERS' VOWS!" IN A TONE OF THE GREATEST AMAZEMENT, WAS HIS ONLY REPLY
TO MR. RUSHWORTH, AND HE TURNED TOWARDS HIS BROTHER AND SISTERS AS IF
HARDLY DOUBTING A CONTRADICTION.

"YES," CRIED MR. YATES. "AFTER ALL OUR DEBATINGS AND DIFFICULTIES, WE
FIND THERE IS NOTHING THAT WILL SUIT US ALTOGETHER SO WELL, NOTHING SO
UNEXCEPTIONABLE, AS LOVERS' VOWS. THE WONDER IS THAT IT SHOULD NOT HAVE
BEEN THOUGHT OF BEFORE. MY STUPIDITY WAS ABOMINABLE, FOR HERE WE HAVE
ALL THE ADVANTAGE OF WHAT I SAW AT ECCLESFORD; AND IT IS SO USEFUL TO
HAVE ANYTHING OF A MODEL! WE HAVE CAST ALMOST EVERY PART."

"BUT WHAT DO YOU DO FOR WOMEN?" SAID EDMUND GRAVELY, AND LOOKING AT
MARIA.

MARIA BLUSHED IN SPITE OF HERSELF AS SHE ANSWERED, "I TAKE THE PART
WHICH LADY RAVENSHAW WAS TO HAVE DONE, AND" (WITH A BOLDER EYE) "MISS
CRAWFORD IS TO BE AMELIA."

"I SHOULD NOT HAVE THOUGHT IT THE SORT OF PLAY TO BE SO EASILY FILLED
UP, WITH US," REPLIED EDMUND, TURNING AWAY TO THE FIRE, WHERE SAT
HIS MOTHER, AUNT, AND FANNY, AND SEATING HIMSELF WITH A LOOK OF GREAT
VEXATION.

MR. RUSHWORTH FOLLOWED HIM TO SAY, "I COME IN THREE TIMES, AND HAVE
TWO-AND-FORTY SPEECHES. THAT'S SOMETHING, IS NOT IT? BUT I DO NOT MUCH
LIKE THE IDEA OF BEING SO FINE. I SHALL HARDLY KNOW MYSELF IN A BLUE
DRESS AND A PINK SATIN CLOAK."

EDMUND COULD NOT ANSWER HIM. IN A FEW MINUTES MR. BERTRAM WAS CALLED
OUT OF THE ROOM TO SATISFY SOME DOUBTS OF THE CARPENTER; AND BEING
ACCOMPANIED BY MR. YATES, AND FOLLOWED SOON AFTERWARDS BY MR. RUSHWORTH,
EDMUND ALMOST IMMEDIATELY TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY OF SAYING, "I CANNOT,
BEFORE MR. YATES, SPEAK WHAT I FEEL AS TO THIS PLAY, WITHOUT REFLECTING
ON HIS FRIENDS AT ECCLESFORD; BUT I MUST NOW, MY DEAR MARIA, TELL YOU,
THAT I THINK IT EXCEEDINGLY UNFIT FOR PRIVATE REPRESENTATION, AND THAT I
HOPE YOU WILL GIVE IT UP. I CANNOT BUT SUPPOSE YOU WILL WHEN YOU HAVE
READ IT CAREFULLY OVER. READ ONLY THE FIRST ACT ALOUD TO EITHER YOUR
MOTHER OR AUNT, AND SEE HOW YOU CAN APPROVE IT. IT WILL NOT BE NECESSARY
TO SEND YOU TO YOUR FATHER'S JUDGMENT, I AM CONVINCED."

"WE SEE THINGS VERY DIFFERENTLY," CRIED MARIA. "I AM PERFECTLY
ACQUAINTED WITH THE PLAY, I ASSURE YOU; AND WITH A VERY FEW OMISSIONS,
AND SO FORTH, WHICH WILL BE MADE, OF COURSE, I CAN SEE NOTHING
OBJECTIONABLE IN IT; AND I AM NOT THE ONLY YOUNG WOMAN YOU FIND WHO
THINKS IT VERY FIT FOR PRIVATE REPRESENTATION."

"I AM SORRY FOR IT," WAS HIS ANSWER; "BUT IN THIS MATTER IT IS YOU WHO
ARE TO LEAD. YOU MUST SET THE EXAMPLE. IF OTHERS HAVE BLUNDERED, IT
IS YOUR PLACE TO PUT THEM RIGHT, AND SHEW THEM WHAT TRUE DELICACY IS.
IN ALL POINTS OF DECORUM YOUR CONDUCT MUST BE LAW TO THE REST OF THE
PARTY."

THIS PICTURE OF HER CONSEQUENCE HAD SOME EFFECT, FOR NO ONE LOVED BETTER
TO LEAD THAN MARIA; AND WITH FAR MORE GOOD-HUMOUR SHE ANSWERED, "I AM
MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU, EDMUND; YOU MEAN VERY WELL, I AM SURE: BUT I STILL
THINK YOU SEE THINGS TOO STRONGLY; AND I REALLY CANNOT UNDERTAKE TO
HARANGUE ALL THE REST UPON A SUBJECT OF THIS KIND. THERE WOULD BE THE
GREATEST INDECORUM, I THINK."

"DO YOU IMAGINE THAT I COULD HAVE SUCH AN IDEA IN MY HEAD? NO; LET YOUR
CONDUCT BE THE ONLY HARANGUE. SAY THAT, ON EXAMINING THE PART, YOU FEEL
YOURSELF UNEQUAL TO IT; THAT YOU FIND IT REQUIRING MORE EXERTION AND
CONFIDENCE THAN YOU CAN BE SUPPOSED TO HAVE. SAY THIS WITH FIRMNESS, AND
IT WILL BE QUITE ENOUGH. ALL WHO CAN DISTINGUISH WILL UNDERSTAND YOUR
MOTIVE. THE PLAY WILL BE GIVEN UP, AND YOUR DELICACY HONOURED AS IT
OUGHT."

"DO NOT ACT ANYTHING IMPROPER, MY DEAR," SAID LADY BERTRAM. "SIR THOMAS
WOULD NOT LIKE IT.--FANNY, RING THE BELL; I MUST HAVE MY DINNER.--TO BE
SURE, JULIA IS DRESSED BY THIS TIME."

"I AM CONVINCED, MADAM," SAID EDMUND, PREVENTING FANNY, "THAT SIR THOMAS
WOULD NOT LIKE IT."

"THERE, MY DEAR, DO YOU HEAR WHAT EDMUND SAYS?"

"IF I WERE TO DECLINE THE PART," SAID MARIA, WITH RENEWED ZEAL, "JULIA
WOULD CERTAINLY TAKE IT."

"WHAT!" CRIED EDMUND, "IF SHE KNEW YOUR REASONS!"

"OH! SHE MIGHT THINK THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN US--THE DIFFERENCE IN OUR
SITUATIONS--THAT SHE NEED NOT BE SO SCRUPULOUS AS I MIGHT FEEL
NECESSARY. I AM SURE SHE WOULD ARGUE SO. NO; YOU MUST EXCUSE ME; I
CANNOT RETRACT MY CONSENT; IT IS TOO FAR SETTLED, EVERYBODY WOULD BE SO
DISAPPOINTED, TOM WOULD BE QUITE ANGRY; AND IF WE ARE SO VERY NICE, WE
SHALL NEVER ACT ANYTHING."

"I WAS JUST GOING TO SAY THE VERY SAME THING," SAID MRS. NORRIS.
"IF EVERY PLAY IS TO BE OBJECTED TO, YOU WILL ACT NOTHING, AND THE
PREPARATIONS WILL BE ALL SO MUCH MONEY THROWN AWAY, AND I AM SURE THAT
WOULD BE A DISCREDIT TO US ALL. I DO NOT KNOW THE PLAY; BUT, AS MARIA
SAYS, IF THERE IS ANYTHING A LITTLE TOO WARM (AND IT IS SO WITH MOST OF
THEM) IT CAN BE EASILY LEFT OUT. WE MUST NOT BE OVER-PRECISE, EDMUND. AS
MR. RUSHWORTH IS TO ACT TOO, THERE CAN BE NO HARM. I ONLY WISH TOM HAD
KNOWN HIS OWN MIND WHEN THE CARPENTERS BEGAN, FOR THERE WAS THE LOSS
OF HALF A DAY'S WORK ABOUT THOSE SIDE-DOORS. THE CURTAIN WILL BE A GOOD
JOB, HOWEVER. THE MAIDS DO THEIR WORK VERY WELL, AND I THINK WE SHALL BE
ABLE TO SEND BACK SOME DOZENS OF THE RINGS. THERE IS NO OCCASION TO PUT
THEM SO VERY CLOSE TOGETHER. I AM OF SOME USE, I HOPE, IN PREVENTING
WASTE AND MAKING THE MOST OF THINGS. THERE SHOULD ALWAYS BE ONE
STEADY HEAD TO SUPERINTEND SO MANY YOUNG ONES. I FORGOT TO TELL TOM OF
SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED TO ME THIS VERY DAY. I HAD BEEN LOOKING ABOUT ME
IN THE POULTRY-YARD, AND WAS JUST COMING OUT, WHEN WHO SHOULD I SEE BUT
DICK JACKSON MAKING UP TO THE SERVANTS' HALL-DOOR WITH TWO BITS OF DEAL
BOARD IN HIS HAND, BRINGING THEM TO FATHER, YOU MAY BE SURE; MOTHER HAD
CHANCED TO SEND HIM OF A MESSAGE TO FATHER, AND THEN FATHER HAD BID
HIM BRING UP THEM TWO BITS OF BOARD, FOR HE COULD NOT NO HOW DO WITHOUT
THEM. I KNEW WHAT ALL THIS MEANT, FOR THE SERVANTS' DINNER-BELL
WAS RINGING AT THE VERY MOMENT OVER OUR HEADS; AND AS I HATE SUCH
ENCROACHING PEOPLE (THE JACKSONS ARE VERY ENCROACHING, I HAVE ALWAYS
SAID SO: JUST THE SORT OF PEOPLE TO GET ALL THEY CAN), I SAID TO THE BOY
DIRECTLY (A GREAT LUBBERLY FELLOW OF TEN YEARS OLD, YOU KNOW, WHO OUGHT
TO BE ASHAMED OF HIMSELF), 'I'LL TAKE THE BOARDS TO YOUR FATHER, DICK,
SO GET YOU HOME AGAIN AS FAST AS YOU CAN.' THE BOY LOOKED VERY SILLY,
AND TURNED AWAY WITHOUT OFFERING A WORD, FOR I BELIEVE I MIGHT SPEAK
PRETTY SHARP; AND I DARE SAY IT WILL CURE HIM OF COMING MARAUDING ABOUT
THE HOUSE FOR ONE WHILE. I HATE SUCH GREEDINESS--SO GOOD AS YOUR FATHER
IS TO THE FAMILY, EMPLOYING THE MAN ALL THE YEAR ROUND!"

NOBODY WAS AT THE TROUBLE OF AN ANSWER; THE OTHERS SOON RETURNED; AND
EDMUND FOUND THAT TO HAVE ENDEAVOURED TO SET THEM RIGHT MUST BE HIS ONLY
SATISFACTION.

DINNER PASSED HEAVILY. MRS. NORRIS RELATED AGAIN HER TRIUMPH OVER DICK
JACKSON, BUT NEITHER PLAY NOR PREPARATION WERE OTHERWISE MUCH TALKED
OF, FOR EDMUND'S DISAPPROBATION WAS FELT EVEN BY HIS BROTHER, THOUGH
HE WOULD NOT HAVE OWNED IT. MARIA, WANTING HENRY CRAWFORD'S ANIMATING
SUPPORT, THOUGHT THE SUBJECT BETTER AVOIDED. MR. YATES, WHO WAS TRYING
TO MAKE HIMSELF AGREEABLE TO JULIA, FOUND HER GLOOM LESS IMPENETRABLE ON
ANY TOPIC THAN THAT OF HIS REGRET AT HER SECESSION FROM THEIR COMPANY;
AND MR. RUSHWORTH, HAVING ONLY HIS OWN PART AND HIS OWN DRESS IN HIS
HEAD, HAD SOON TALKED AWAY ALL THAT COULD BE SAID OF EITHER.

BUT THE CONCERNS OF THE THEATRE WERE SUSPENDED ONLY FOR AN HOUR OR TWO:
THERE WAS STILL A GREAT DEAL TO BE SETTLED; AND THE SPIRITS OF EVENING
GIVING FRESH COURAGE, TOM, MARIA, AND MR. YATES, SOON AFTER THEIR BEING
REASSEMBLED IN THE DRAWING-ROOM, SEATED THEMSELVES IN COMMITTEE AT A
SEPARATE TABLE, WITH THE PLAY OPEN BEFORE THEM, AND WERE JUST GETTING
DEEP IN THE SUBJECT WHEN A MOST WELCOME INTERRUPTION WAS GIVEN BY THE
ENTRANCE OF MR. AND MISS CRAWFORD, WHO, LATE AND DARK AND DIRTY AS IT
WAS, COULD NOT HELP COMING, AND WERE RECEIVED WITH THE MOST GRATEFUL
JOY.

"WELL, HOW DO YOU GO ON?" AND "WHAT HAVE YOU SETTLED?" AND "OH! WE
CAN DO NOTHING WITHOUT YOU," FOLLOWED THE FIRST SALUTATIONS; AND HENRY
CRAWFORD WAS SOON SEATED WITH THE OTHER THREE AT THE TABLE, WHILE HIS
SISTER MADE HER WAY TO LADY BERTRAM, AND WITH PLEASANT ATTENTION WAS
COMPLIMENTING HER. "I MUST REALLY CONGRATULATE YOUR LADYSHIP," SAID
SHE, "ON THE PLAY BEING CHOSEN; FOR THOUGH YOU HAVE BORNE IT WITH
EXEMPLARY PATIENCE, I AM SURE YOU MUST BE SICK OF ALL OUR NOISE AND
DIFFICULTIES. THE ACTORS MAY BE GLAD, BUT THE BYSTANDERS MUST BE
INFINITELY MORE THANKFUL FOR A DECISION; AND I DO SINCERELY GIVE YOU
JOY, MADAM, AS WELL AS MRS. NORRIS, AND EVERYBODY ELSE WHO IS IN THE
SAME PREDICAMENT," GLANCING HALF FEARFULLY, HALF SLYLY, BEYOND FANNY TO
EDMUND.

SHE WAS VERY CIVILLY ANSWERED BY LADY BERTRAM, BUT EDMUND SAID NOTHING.
HIS BEING ONLY A BYSTANDER WAS NOT DISCLAIMED. AFTER CONTINUING IN CHAT
WITH THE PARTY ROUND THE FIRE A FEW MINUTES, MISS CRAWFORD RETURNED
TO THE PARTY ROUND THE TABLE; AND STANDING BY THEM, SEEMED TO
INTEREST HERSELF IN THEIR ARRANGEMENTS TILL, AS IF STRUCK BY A SUDDEN
RECOLLECTION, SHE EXCLAIMED, "MY GOOD FRIENDS, YOU ARE MOST COMPOSEDLY
AT WORK UPON THESE COTTAGES AND ALEHOUSES, INSIDE AND OUT; BUT PRAY LET
ME KNOW MY FATE IN THE MEANWHILE. WHO IS TO BE ANHALT? WHAT GENTLEMAN
AMONG YOU AM I TO HAVE THE PLEASURE OF MAKING LOVE TO?"

FOR A MOMENT NO ONE SPOKE; AND THEN MANY SPOKE TOGETHER TO TELL THE SAME
MELANCHOLY TRUTH, THAT THEY HAD NOT YET GOT ANY ANHALT. "MR. RUSHWORTH
WAS TO BE COUNT CASSEL, BUT NO ONE HAD YET UNDERTAKEN ANHALT."

"I HAD MY CHOICE OF THE PARTS," SAID MR. RUSHWORTH; "BUT I THOUGHT I
SHOULD LIKE THE COUNT BEST, THOUGH I DO NOT MUCH RELISH THE FINERY I AM
TO HAVE."

"YOU CHOSE VERY WISELY, I AM SURE," REPLIED MISS CRAWFORD, WITH A
BRIGHTENED LOOK; "ANHALT IS A HEAVY PART."

"THE COUNT HAS TWO-AND-FORTY SPEECHES," RETURNED MR. RUSHWORTH,
"WHICH IS NO TRIFLE."

"I AM NOT AT ALL SURPRISED," SAID MISS CRAWFORD, AFTER A SHORT PAUSE,
"AT THIS WANT OF AN ANHALT. AMELIA DESERVES NO BETTER. SUCH A FORWARD
YOUNG LADY MAY WELL FRIGHTEN THE MEN."

"I SHOULD BE BUT TOO HAPPY IN TAKING THE PART, IF IT WERE POSSIBLE,"
CRIED TOM; "BUT, UNLUCKILY, THE BUTLER AND ANHALT ARE IN TOGETHER. I
WILL NOT ENTIRELY GIVE IT UP, HOWEVER; I WILL TRY WHAT CAN BE DONE--I
WILL LOOK IT OVER AGAIN."

"YOUR BROTHER SHOULD TAKE THE PART," SAID MR. YATES, IN A LOW VOICE.
"DO NOT YOU THINK HE WOULD?"

"I SHALL NOT ASK HIM," REPLIED TOM, IN A COLD, DETERMINED MANNER.

MISS CRAWFORD TALKED OF SOMETHING ELSE, AND SOON AFTERWARDS REJOINED THE
PARTY AT THE FIRE.

"THEY DO NOT WANT ME AT ALL," SAID SHE, SEATING HERSELF. "I ONLY PUZZLE
THEM, AND OBLIGE THEM TO MAKE CIVIL SPEECHES. MR. EDMUND BERTRAM, AS
YOU DO NOT ACT YOURSELF, YOU WILL BE A DISINTERESTED ADVISER; AND,
THEREFORE, I APPLY TO YOU. WHAT SHALL WE DO FOR AN ANHALT? IS IT
PRACTICABLE FOR ANY OF THE OTHERS TO DOUBLE IT? WHAT IS YOUR ADVICE?"

"MY ADVICE," SAID HE CALMLY, "IS THAT YOU CHANGE THE PLAY."

"I SHOULD HAVE NO OBJECTION," SHE REPLIED; "FOR THOUGH I SHOULD NOT
PARTICULARLY DISLIKE THE PART OF AMELIA IF WELL SUPPORTED, THAT IS, IF
EVERYTHING WENT WELL, I SHALL BE SORRY TO BE AN INCONVENIENCE; BUT
AS THEY DO NOT CHUSE TO HEAR YOUR ADVICE AT THAT TABLE" (LOOKING
ROUND), "IT CERTAINLY WILL NOT BE TAKEN."

EDMUND SAID NO MORE.

"IF ANY PART COULD TEMPT YOU TO ACT, I SUPPOSE IT WOULD BE ANHALT,"
OBSERVED THE LADY ARCHLY, AFTER A SHORT PAUSE; "FOR HE IS A CLERGYMAN,
YOU KNOW."

"THAT CIRCUMSTANCE WOULD BY NO MEANS TEMPT ME," HE REPLIED, "FOR I
SHOULD BE SORRY TO MAKE THE CHARACTER RIDICULOUS BY BAD ACTING. IT
MUST BE VERY DIFFICULT TO KEEP ANHALT FROM APPEARING A FORMAL, SOLEMN
LECTURER; AND THE MAN WHO CHUSES THE PROFESSION ITSELF IS, PERHAPS, ONE
OF THE LAST WHO WOULD WISH TO REPRESENT IT ON THE STAGE."

MISS CRAWFORD WAS SILENCED, AND WITH SOME FEELINGS OF RESENTMENT AND
MORTIFICATION, MOVED HER CHAIR CONSIDERABLY NEARER THE TEA-TABLE, AND
GAVE ALL HER ATTENTION TO MRS. NORRIS, WHO WAS PRESIDING THERE.

"FANNY," CRIED TOM BERTRAM, FROM THE OTHER TABLE, WHERE THE CONFERENCE
WAS EAGERLY CARRYING ON, AND THE CONVERSATION INCESSANT, "WE WANT YOUR
SERVICES."

FANNY WAS UP IN A MOMENT, EXPECTING SOME ERRAND; FOR THE HABIT OF
EMPLOYING HER IN THAT WAY WAS NOT YET OVERCOME, IN SPITE OF ALL THAT
EDMUND COULD DO.

"OH! WE DO NOT WANT TO DISTURB YOU FROM YOUR SEAT. WE DO NOT WANT YOUR
PRESENT SERVICES. WE SHALL ONLY WANT YOU IN OUR PLAY. YOU MUST BE
COTTAGER'S WIFE."

"ME!" CRIED FANNY, SITTING DOWN AGAIN WITH A MOST FRIGHTENED LOOK.
"INDEED YOU MUST EXCUSE ME. I COULD NOT ACT ANYTHING IF YOU WERE TO GIVE
ME THE WORLD. NO, INDEED, I CANNOT ACT."

"INDEED, BUT YOU MUST, FOR WE CANNOT EXCUSE YOU. IT NEED NOT FRIGHTEN
YOU: IT IS A NOTHING OF A PART, A MERE NOTHING, NOT ABOVE HALF A DOZEN
SPEECHES ALTOGETHER, AND IT WILL NOT MUCH SIGNIFY IF NOBODY HEARS A WORD
YOU SAY; SO YOU MAY BE AS CREEP-MOUSE AS YOU LIKE, BUT WE MUST HAVE YOU
TO LOOK AT."

"IF YOU ARE AFRAID OF HALF A DOZEN SPEECHES," CRIED MR. RUSHWORTH, "WHAT
WOULD YOU DO WITH SUCH A PART AS MINE? I HAVE FORTY-TWO TO LEARN."

"IT IS NOT THAT I AM AFRAID OF LEARNING BY HEART," SAID FANNY, SHOCKED
TO FIND HERSELF AT THAT MOMENT THE ONLY SPEAKER IN THE ROOM, AND TO FEEL
THAT ALMOST EVERY EYE WAS UPON HER; "BUT I REALLY CANNOT ACT."

"YES, YES, YOU CAN ACT WELL ENOUGH FOR US. LEARN YOUR PART, AND WE
WILL TEACH YOU ALL THE REST. YOU HAVE ONLY TWO SCENES, AND AS I SHALL
BE COTTAGER, I'LL PUT YOU IN AND PUSH YOU ABOUT, AND YOU WILL DO IT VERY
WELL, I'LL ANSWER FOR IT."

"NO, INDEED, MR. BERTRAM, YOU MUST EXCUSE ME. YOU CANNOT HAVE AN IDEA.
IT WOULD BE ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME. IF I WERE TO UNDERTAKE IT, I
SHOULD ONLY DISAPPOINT YOU."

"PHOO! PHOO! DO NOT BE SO SHAMEFACED. YOU'LL DO IT VERY WELL. EVERY
ALLOWANCE WILL BE MADE FOR YOU. WE DO NOT EXPECT PERFECTION. YOU MUST
GET A BROWN GOWN, AND A WHITE APRON, AND A MOB CAP, AND WE MUST MAKE
YOU A FEW WRINKLES, AND A LITTLE OF THE CROWSFOOT AT THE CORNER OF YOUR
EYES, AND YOU WILL BE A VERY PROPER, LITTLE OLD WOMAN."

"YOU MUST EXCUSE ME, INDEED YOU MUST EXCUSE ME," CRIED FANNY, GROWING
MORE AND MORE RED FROM EXCESSIVE AGITATION, AND LOOKING DISTRESSFULLY
AT EDMUND, WHO WAS KINDLY OBSERVING HER; BUT UNWILLING TO EXASPERATE
HIS BROTHER BY INTERFERENCE, GAVE HER ONLY AN ENCOURAGING SMILE. HER
ENTREATY HAD NO EFFECT ON TOM: HE ONLY SAID AGAIN WHAT HE HAD SAID
BEFORE; AND IT WAS NOT MERELY TOM, FOR THE REQUISITION WAS NOW BACKED BY
MARIA, AND MR. CRAWFORD, AND MR. YATES, WITH AN URGENCY WHICH DIFFERED
FROM HIS BUT IN BEING MORE GENTLE OR MORE CEREMONIOUS, AND WHICH
ALTOGETHER WAS QUITE OVERPOWERING TO FANNY; AND BEFORE SHE COULD BREATHE
AFTER IT, MRS. NORRIS COMPLETED THE WHOLE BY THUS ADDRESSING HER IN A
WHISPER AT ONCE ANGRY AND AUDIBLE--"WHAT A PIECE OF WORK HERE IS ABOUT
NOTHING: I AM QUITE ASHAMED OF YOU, FANNY, TO MAKE SUCH A DIFFICULTY OF
OBLIGING YOUR COUSINS IN A TRIFLE OF THIS SORT--SO KIND AS THEY ARE TO
YOU! TAKE THE PART WITH A GOOD GRACE, AND LET US HEAR NO MORE OF THE
MATTER, I ENTREAT."

"DO NOT URGE HER, MADAM," SAID EDMUND. "IT IS NOT FAIR TO URGE HER
IN THIS MANNER. YOU SEE SHE DOES NOT LIKE TO ACT. LET HER CHUSE FOR
HERSELF, AS WELL AS THE REST OF US. HER JUDGMENT MAY BE QUITE AS SAFELY
TRUSTED. DO NOT URGE HER ANY MORE."

"I AM NOT GOING TO URGE HER," REPLIED MRS. NORRIS SHARPLY; "BUT I SHALL
THINK HER A VERY OBSTINATE, UNGRATEFUL GIRL, IF SHE DOES NOT DO WHAT HER
AUNT AND COUSINS WISH HER--VERY UNGRATEFUL, INDEED, CONSIDERING WHO AND
WHAT SHE IS."

EDMUND WAS TOO ANGRY TO SPEAK; BUT MISS CRAWFORD, LOOKING FOR A MOMENT
WITH ASTONISHED EYES AT MRS. NORRIS, AND THEN AT FANNY, WHOSE TEARS WERE
BEGINNING TO SHEW THEMSELVES, IMMEDIATELY SAID, WITH SOME KEENNESS, "I
DO NOT LIKE MY SITUATION: THIS PLACE IS TOO HOT FOR ME," AND MOVED
AWAY HER CHAIR TO THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE TABLE, CLOSE TO FANNY, SAYING
TO HER, IN A KIND, LOW WHISPER, AS SHE PLACED HERSELF, "NEVER MIND,
MY DEAR MISS PRICE, THIS IS A CROSS EVENING: EVERYBODY IS CROSS AND
TEASING, BUT DO NOT LET US MIND THEM"; AND WITH POINTED ATTENTION
CONTINUED TO TALK TO HER AND ENDEAVOUR TO RAISE HER SPIRITS, IN SPITE OF
BEING OUT OF SPIRITS HERSELF. BY A LOOK AT HER BROTHER SHE PREVENTED ANY
FARTHER ENTREATY FROM THE THEATRICAL BOARD, AND THE REALLY GOOD FEELINGS
BY WHICH SHE WAS ALMOST PURELY GOVERNED WERE RAPIDLY RESTORING HER TO
ALL THE LITTLE SHE HAD LOST IN EDMUND'S FAVOUR.

FANNY DID NOT LOVE MISS CRAWFORD; BUT SHE FELT VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO HER
FOR HER PRESENT KINDNESS; AND WHEN, FROM TAKING NOTICE OF HER WORK,
AND WISHING SHE COULD WORK AS WELL, AND BEGGING FOR THE PATTERN, AND
SUPPOSING FANNY WAS NOW PREPARING FOR HER APPEARANCE, AS OF COURSE SHE
WOULD COME OUT WHEN HER COUSIN WAS MARRIED, MISS CRAWFORD PROCEEDED TO
INQUIRE IF SHE HAD HEARD LATELY FROM HER BROTHER AT SEA, AND SAID THAT
SHE HAD QUITE A CURIOSITY TO SEE HIM, AND IMAGINED HIM A VERY FINE YOUNG
MAN, AND ADVISED FANNY TO GET HIS PICTURE DRAWN BEFORE HE WENT TO SEA
AGAIN--SHE COULD NOT HELP ADMITTING IT TO BE VERY AGREEABLE FLATTERY, OR
HELP LISTENING, AND ANSWERING WITH MORE ANIMATION THAN SHE HAD INTENDED.

THE CONSULTATION UPON THE PLAY STILL WENT ON, AND MISS CRAWFORD'S
ATTENTION WAS FIRST CALLED FROM FANNY BY TOM BERTRAM'S TELLING HER,
WITH INFINITE REGRET, THAT HE FOUND IT ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO
UNDERTAKE THE PART OF ANHALT IN ADDITION TO THE BUTLER: HE HAD BEEN MOST
ANXIOUSLY TRYING TO MAKE IT OUT TO BE FEASIBLE, BUT IT WOULD NOT DO;
HE MUST GIVE IT UP. "BUT THERE WILL NOT BE THE SMALLEST DIFFICULTY IN
FILLING IT," HE ADDED. "WE HAVE BUT TO SPEAK THE WORD; WE MAY PICK AND
CHUSE. I COULD NAME, AT THIS MOMENT, AT LEAST SIX YOUNG MEN WITHIN SIX
MILES OF US, WHO ARE WILD TO BE ADMITTED INTO OUR COMPANY, AND THERE ARE
ONE OR TWO THAT WOULD NOT DISGRACE US: I SHOULD NOT BE AFRAID TO TRUST
EITHER OF THE OLIVERS OR CHARLES MADDOX. TOM OLIVER IS A VERY CLEVER
FELLOW, AND CHARLES MADDOX IS AS GENTLEMANLIKE A MAN AS YOU WILL SEE
ANYWHERE, SO I WILL TAKE MY HORSE EARLY TO-MORROW MORNING AND RIDE OVER
TO STOKE, AND SETTLE WITH ONE OF THEM."

WHILE HE SPOKE, MARIA WAS LOOKING APPREHENSIVELY ROUND AT EDMUND IN FULL
EXPECTATION THAT HE MUST OPPOSE SUCH AN ENLARGEMENT OF THE PLAN AS THIS:
SO CONTRARY TO ALL THEIR FIRST PROTESTATIONS; BUT EDMUND SAID NOTHING.
AFTER A MOMENT'S THOUGHT, MISS CRAWFORD CALMLY REPLIED, "AS FAR AS I
AM CONCERNED, I CAN HAVE NO OBJECTION TO ANYTHING THAT YOU ALL THINK
ELIGIBLE. HAVE I EVER SEEN EITHER OF THE GENTLEMEN? YES, MR. CHARLES
MADDOX DINED AT MY SISTER'S ONE DAY, DID NOT HE, HENRY? A QUIET-LOOKING
YOUNG MAN. I REMEMBER HIM. LET HIM BE APPLIED TO, IF YOU PLEASE, FOR
IT WILL BE LESS UNPLEASANT TO ME THAN TO HAVE A PERFECT STRANGER."

CHARLES MADDOX WAS TO BE THE MAN. TOM REPEATED HIS RESOLUTION OF GOING
TO HIM EARLY ON THE MORROW; AND THOUGH JULIA, WHO HAD SCARCELY OPENED
HER LIPS BEFORE, OBSERVED, IN A SARCASTIC MANNER, AND WITH A GLANCE
FIRST AT MARIA AND THEN AT EDMUND, THAT "THE MANSFIELD THEATRICALS WOULD
ENLIVEN THE WHOLE NEIGHBOURHOOD EXCEEDINGLY," EDMUND STILL HELD HIS
PEACE, AND SHEWED HIS FEELINGS ONLY BY A DETERMINED GRAVITY.

"I AM NOT VERY SANGUINE AS TO OUR PLAY," SAID MISS CRAWFORD, IN AN
UNDERVOICE TO FANNY, AFTER SOME CONSIDERATION; "AND I CAN TELL MR.
MADDOX THAT I SHALL SHORTEN SOME OF HIS SPEECHES, AND A GREAT MANY OF
MY OWN, BEFORE WE REHEARSE TOGETHER. IT WILL BE VERY DISAGREEABLE,
AND BY NO MEANS WHAT I EXPECTED."



CHAPTER XVI

IT WAS NOT IN MISS CRAWFORD'S POWER TO TALK FANNY INTO ANY REAL
FORGETFULNESS OF WHAT HAD PASSED. WHEN THE EVENING WAS OVER, SHE WENT TO
BED FULL OF IT, HER NERVES STILL AGITATED BY THE SHOCK OF SUCH AN ATTACK
FROM HER COUSIN TOM, SO PUBLIC AND SO PERSEVERED IN, AND HER SPIRITS
SINKING UNDER HER AUNT'S UNKIND REFLECTION AND REPROACH. TO BE CALLED
INTO NOTICE IN SUCH A MANNER, TO HEAR THAT IT WAS BUT THE PRELUDE TO
SOMETHING SO INFINITELY WORSE, TO BE TOLD THAT SHE MUST DO WHAT WAS
SO IMPOSSIBLE AS TO ACT; AND THEN TO HAVE THE CHARGE OF OBSTINACY AND
INGRATITUDE FOLLOW IT, ENFORCED WITH SUCH A HINT AT THE DEPENDENCE
OF HER SITUATION, HAD BEEN TOO DISTRESSING AT THE TIME TO MAKE THE
REMEMBRANCE WHEN SHE WAS ALONE MUCH LESS SO, ESPECIALLY WITH THE
SUPERADDED DREAD OF WHAT THE MORROW MIGHT PRODUCE IN CONTINUATION OF THE
SUBJECT. MISS CRAWFORD HAD PROTECTED HER ONLY FOR THE TIME; AND IF
SHE WERE APPLIED TO AGAIN AMONG THEMSELVES WITH ALL THE AUTHORITATIVE
URGENCY THAT TOM AND MARIA WERE CAPABLE OF, AND EDMUND PERHAPS AWAY,
WHAT SHOULD SHE DO? SHE FELL ASLEEP BEFORE SHE COULD ANSWER THE
QUESTION, AND FOUND IT QUITE AS PUZZLING WHEN SHE AWOKE THE NEXT
MORNING. THE LITTLE WHITE ATTIC, WHICH HAD CONTINUED HER SLEEPING-ROOM
EVER SINCE HER FIRST ENTERING THE FAMILY, PROVING INCOMPETENT TO SUGGEST
ANY REPLY, SHE HAD RECOURSE, AS SOON AS SHE WAS DRESSED, TO ANOTHER
APARTMENT MORE SPACIOUS AND MORE MEET FOR WALKING ABOUT IN AND THINKING,
AND OF WHICH SHE HAD NOW FOR SOME TIME BEEN ALMOST EQUALLY MISTRESS. IT
HAD BEEN THEIR SCHOOL-ROOM; SO CALLED TILL THE MISS BERTRAMS WOULD NOT
ALLOW IT TO BE CALLED SO ANY LONGER, AND INHABITED AS SUCH TO A LATER
PERIOD. THERE MISS LEE HAD LIVED, AND THERE THEY HAD READ AND WRITTEN,
AND TALKED AND LAUGHED, TILL WITHIN THE LAST THREE YEARS, WHEN SHE HAD
QUITTED THEM. THE ROOM HAD THEN BECOME USELESS, AND FOR SOME TIME WAS
QUITE DESERTED, EXCEPT BY FANNY, WHEN SHE VISITED HER PLANTS, OR WANTED
ONE OF THE BOOKS, WHICH SHE WAS STILL GLAD TO KEEP THERE, FROM THE
DEFICIENCY OF SPACE AND ACCOMMODATION IN HER LITTLE CHAMBER ABOVE: BUT
GRADUALLY, AS HER VALUE FOR THE COMFORTS OF IT INCREASED, SHE HAD ADDED
TO HER POSSESSIONS, AND SPENT MORE OF HER TIME THERE; AND HAVING NOTHING
TO OPPOSE HER, HAD SO NATURALLY AND SO ARTLESSLY WORKED HERSELF INTO IT,
THAT IT WAS NOW GENERALLY ADMITTED TO BE HERS. THE EAST ROOM, AS IT HAD
BEEN CALLED EVER SINCE MARIA BERTRAM WAS SIXTEEN, WAS NOW CONSIDERED
FANNY'S, ALMOST AS DECIDEDLY AS THE WHITE ATTIC: THE SMALLNESS OF THE
ONE MAKING THE USE OF THE OTHER SO EVIDENTLY REASONABLE THAT THE MISS
BERTRAMS, WITH EVERY SUPERIORITY IN THEIR OWN APARTMENTS WHICH THEIR OWN
SENSE OF SUPERIORITY COULD DEMAND, WERE ENTIRELY APPROVING IT; AND MRS.
NORRIS, HAVING STIPULATED FOR THERE NEVER BEING A FIRE IN IT ON FANNY'S
ACCOUNT, WAS TOLERABLY RESIGNED TO HER HAVING THE USE OF WHAT NOBODY
ELSE WANTED, THOUGH THE TERMS IN WHICH SHE SOMETIMES SPOKE OF THE
INDULGENCE SEEMED TO IMPLY THAT IT WAS THE BEST ROOM IN THE HOUSE.

THE ASPECT WAS SO FAVOURABLE THAT EVEN WITHOUT A FIRE IT WAS HABITABLE
IN MANY AN EARLY SPRING AND LATE AUTUMN MORNING TO SUCH A WILLING MIND
AS FANNY'S; AND WHILE THERE WAS A GLEAM OF SUNSHINE SHE HOPED NOT TO BE
DRIVEN FROM IT ENTIRELY, EVEN WHEN WINTER CAME. THE COMFORT OF IT IN
HER HOURS OF LEISURE WAS EXTREME. SHE COULD GO THERE AFTER ANYTHING
UNPLEASANT BELOW, AND FIND IMMEDIATE CONSOLATION IN SOME PURSUIT, OR
SOME TRAIN OF THOUGHT AT HAND. HER PLANTS, HER BOOKS--OF WHICH SHE HAD
BEEN A COLLECTOR FROM THE FIRST HOUR OF HER COMMANDING A SHILLING--HER
WRITING-DESK, AND HER WORKS OF CHARITY AND INGENUITY, WERE ALL WITHIN
HER REACH; OR IF INDISPOSED FOR EMPLOYMENT, IF NOTHING BUT MUSING WOULD
DO, SHE COULD SCARCELY SEE AN OBJECT IN THAT ROOM WHICH HAD NOT AN
INTERESTING REMEMBRANCE CONNECTED WITH IT. EVERYTHING WAS A FRIEND, OR
BORE HER THOUGHTS TO A FRIEND; AND THOUGH THERE HAD BEEN SOMETIMES MUCH
OF SUFFERING TO HER; THOUGH HER MOTIVES HAD OFTEN BEEN MISUNDERSTOOD,
HER FEELINGS DISREGARDED, AND HER COMPREHENSION UNDERVALUED; THOUGH SHE
HAD KNOWN THE PAINS OF TYRANNY, OF RIDICULE, AND NEGLECT, YET ALMOST
EVERY RECURRENCE OF EITHER HAD LED TO SOMETHING CONSOLATORY: HER AUNT
BERTRAM HAD SPOKEN FOR HER, OR MISS LEE HAD BEEN ENCOURAGING, OR, WHAT
WAS YET MORE FREQUENT OR MORE DEAR, EDMUND HAD BEEN HER CHAMPION AND HER
FRIEND: HE HAD SUPPORTED HER CAUSE OR EXPLAINED HER MEANING, HE HAD TOLD
HER NOT TO CRY, OR HAD GIVEN HER SOME PROOF OF AFFECTION WHICH MADE
HER TEARS DELIGHTFUL; AND THE WHOLE WAS NOW SO BLENDED TOGETHER, SO
HARMONISED BY DISTANCE, THAT EVERY FORMER AFFLICTION HAD ITS CHARM. THE
ROOM WAS MOST DEAR TO HER, AND SHE WOULD NOT HAVE CHANGED ITS FURNITURE
FOR THE HANDSOMEST IN THE HOUSE, THOUGH WHAT HAD BEEN ORIGINALLY PLAIN
HAD SUFFERED ALL THE ILL-USAGE OF CHILDREN; AND ITS GREATEST ELEGANCIES
AND ORNAMENTS WERE A FADED FOOTSTOOL OF JULIA'S WORK, TOO ILL DONE
FOR THE DRAWING-ROOM, THREE TRANSPARENCIES, MADE IN A RAGE FOR
TRANSPARENCIES, FOR THE THREE LOWER PANES OF ONE WINDOW, WHERE TINTERN
ABBEY HELD ITS STATION BETWEEN A CAVE IN ITALY AND A MOONLIGHT LAKE IN
CUMBERLAND, A COLLECTION OF FAMILY PROFILES, THOUGHT UNWORTHY OF BEING
ANYWHERE ELSE, OVER THE MANTELPIECE, AND BY THEIR SIDE, AND PINNED
AGAINST THE WALL, A SMALL SKETCH OF A SHIP SENT FOUR YEARS AGO FROM THE
MEDITERRANEAN BY WILLIAM, WITH H.M.S. ANTWERP AT THE BOTTOM, IN LETTERS
AS TALL AS THE MAINMAST.

TO THIS NEST OF COMFORTS FANNY NOW WALKED DOWN TO TRY ITS INFLUENCE ON
AN AGITATED, DOUBTING SPIRIT, TO SEE IF BY LOOKING AT EDMUND'S PROFILE
SHE COULD CATCH ANY OF HIS COUNSEL, OR BY GIVING AIR TO HER GERANIUMS
SHE MIGHT INHALE A BREEZE OF MENTAL STRENGTH HERSELF. BUT SHE HAD MORE
THAN FEARS OF HER OWN PERSEVERANCE TO REMOVE: SHE HAD BEGUN TO FEEL
UNDECIDED AS TO WHAT SHE OUGHT TO DO; AND AS SHE WALKED ROUND THE
ROOM HER DOUBTS WERE INCREASING. WAS SHE RIGHT IN REFUSING WHAT WAS
SO WARMLY ASKED, SO STRONGLY WISHED FOR--WHAT MIGHT BE SO ESSENTIAL TO A
SCHEME ON WHICH SOME OF THOSE TO WHOM SHE OWED THE GREATEST COMPLAISANCE
HAD SET THEIR HEARTS? WAS IT NOT ILL-NATURE, SELFISHNESS, AND A FEAR OF
EXPOSING HERSELF? AND WOULD EDMUND'S JUDGMENT, WOULD HIS PERSUASION OF
SIR THOMAS'S DISAPPROBATION OF THE WHOLE, BE ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY HER IN A
DETERMINED DENIAL IN SPITE OF ALL THE REST? IT WOULD BE SO HORRIBLE TO
HER TO ACT THAT SHE WAS INCLINED TO SUSPECT THE TRUTH AND PURITY OF HER
OWN SCRUPLES; AND AS SHE LOOKED AROUND HER, THE CLAIMS OF HER COUSINS
TO BEING OBLIGED WERE STRENGTHENED BY THE SIGHT OF PRESENT UPON PRESENT
THAT SHE HAD RECEIVED FROM THEM. THE TABLE BETWEEN THE WINDOWS WAS
COVERED WITH WORK-BOXES AND NETTING-BOXES WHICH HAD BEEN GIVEN HER AT
DIFFERENT TIMES, PRINCIPALLY BY TOM; AND SHE GREW BEWILDERED AS TO THE
AMOUNT OF THE DEBT WHICH ALL THESE KIND REMEMBRANCES PRODUCED. A TAP AT
THE DOOR ROUSED HER IN THE MIDST OF THIS ATTEMPT TO FIND HER WAY TO HER
DUTY, AND HER GENTLE "COME IN" WAS ANSWERED BY THE APPEARANCE OF ONE,
BEFORE WHOM ALL HER DOUBTS WERE WONT TO BE LAID. HER EYES BRIGHTENED AT
THE SIGHT OF EDMUND.

"CAN I SPEAK WITH YOU, FANNY, FOR A FEW MINUTES?" SAID HE.

"YES, CERTAINLY."

"I WANT TO CONSULT. I WANT YOUR OPINION."

"MY OPINION!" SHE CRIED, SHRINKING FROM SUCH A COMPLIMENT, HIGHLY AS IT
GRATIFIED HER.

"YES, YOUR ADVICE AND OPINION. I DO NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO. THIS ACTING
SCHEME GETS WORSE AND WORSE, YOU SEE. THEY HAVE CHOSEN ALMOST AS BAD A
PLAY AS THEY COULD, AND NOW, TO COMPLETE THE BUSINESS, ARE GOING TO ASK
THE HELP OF A YOUNG MAN VERY SLIGHTLY KNOWN TO ANY OF US. THIS IS THE
END OF ALL THE PRIVACY AND PROPRIETY WHICH WAS TALKED ABOUT AT FIRST.
I KNOW NO HARM OF CHARLES MADDOX; BUT THE EXCESSIVE INTIMACY WHICH
MUST SPRING FROM HIS BEING ADMITTED AMONG US IN THIS MANNER IS HIGHLY
OBJECTIONABLE, THE MORE THAN INTIMACY--THE FAMILIARITY. I CANNOT
THINK OF IT WITH ANY PATIENCE; AND IT DOES APPEAR TO ME AN EVIL OF SUCH
MAGNITUDE AS MUST, IF POSSIBLE, BE PREVENTED. DO NOT YOU SEE IT IN
THE SAME LIGHT?"

"YES; BUT WHAT CAN BE DONE? YOUR BROTHER IS SO DETERMINED."

"THERE IS BUT ONE THING TO BE DONE, FANNY. I MUST TAKE ANHALT MYSELF.
I AM WELL AWARE THAT NOTHING ELSE WILL QUIET TOM."

FANNY COULD NOT ANSWER HIM.

"IT IS NOT AT ALL WHAT I LIKE," HE CONTINUED. "NO MAN CAN LIKE BEING
DRIVEN INTO THE APPEARANCE OF SUCH INCONSISTENCY. AFTER BEING KNOWN TO
OPPOSE THE SCHEME FROM THE BEGINNING, THERE IS ABSURDITY IN THE FACE OF
MY JOINING THEM NOW, WHEN THEY ARE EXCEEDING THEIR FIRST PLAN IN EVERY
RESPECT; BUT I CAN THINK OF NO OTHER ALTERNATIVE. CAN YOU, FANNY?"

"NO," SAID FANNY SLOWLY, "NOT IMMEDIATELY, BUT--"

"BUT WHAT? I SEE YOUR JUDGMENT IS NOT WITH ME. THINK IT A LITTLE OVER.
PERHAPS YOU ARE NOT SO MUCH AWARE AS I AM OF THE MISCHIEF THAT MAY, OF
THE UNPLEASANTNESS THAT MUST ARISE FROM A YOUNG MAN'S BEING RECEIVED
IN THIS MANNER: DOMESTICATED AMONG US; AUTHORISED TO COME AT ALL HOURS,
AND PLACED SUDDENLY ON A FOOTING WHICH MUST DO AWAY ALL RESTRAINTS. TO
THINK ONLY OF THE LICENCE WHICH EVERY REHEARSAL MUST TEND TO CREATE. IT
IS ALL VERY BAD! PUT YOURSELF IN MISS CRAWFORD'S PLACE, FANNY. CONSIDER
WHAT IT WOULD BE TO ACT AMELIA WITH A STRANGER. SHE HAS A RIGHT TO BE
FELT FOR, BECAUSE SHE EVIDENTLY FEELS FOR HERSELF. I HEARD ENOUGH OF
WHAT SHE SAID TO YOU LAST NIGHT TO UNDERSTAND HER UNWILLINGNESS TO BE
ACTING WITH A STRANGER; AND AS SHE PROBABLY ENGAGED IN THE PART WITH
DIFFERENT EXPECTATIONS--PERHAPS WITHOUT CONSIDERING THE SUBJECT ENOUGH
TO KNOW WHAT WAS LIKELY TO BE--IT WOULD BE UNGENEROUS, IT WOULD BE
REALLY WRONG TO EXPOSE HER TO IT. HER FEELINGS OUGHT TO BE RESPECTED.
DOES IT NOT STRIKE YOU SO, FANNY? YOU HESITATE."

"I AM SORRY FOR MISS CRAWFORD; BUT I AM MORE SORRY TO SEE YOU DRAWN IN
TO DO WHAT YOU HAD RESOLVED AGAINST, AND WHAT YOU ARE KNOWN TO THINK
WILL BE DISAGREEABLE TO MY UNCLE. IT WILL BE SUCH A TRIUMPH TO THE
OTHERS!"

"THEY WILL NOT HAVE MUCH CAUSE OF TRIUMPH WHEN THEY SEE HOW INFAMOUSLY I
ACT. BUT, HOWEVER, TRIUMPH THERE CERTAINLY WILL BE, AND I MUST BRAVE IT.
BUT IF I CAN BE THE MEANS OF RESTRAINING THE PUBLICITY OF THE BUSINESS,
OF LIMITING THE EXHIBITION, OF CONCENTRATING OUR FOLLY, I SHALL BE
WELL REPAID. AS I AM NOW, I HAVE NO INFLUENCE, I CAN DO NOTHING: I HAVE
OFFENDED THEM, AND THEY WILL NOT HEAR ME; BUT WHEN I HAVE PUT THEM IN
GOOD-HUMOUR BY THIS CONCESSION, I AM NOT WITHOUT HOPES OF PERSUADING
THEM TO CONFINE THE REPRESENTATION WITHIN A MUCH SMALLER CIRCLE THAN
THEY ARE NOW IN THE HIGH ROAD FOR. THIS WILL BE A MATERIAL GAIN. MY
OBJECT IS TO CONFINE IT TO MRS. RUSHWORTH AND THE GRANTS. WILL NOT THIS
BE WORTH GAINING?"

"YES, IT WILL BE A GREAT POINT."

"BUT STILL IT HAS NOT YOUR APPROBATION. CAN YOU MENTION ANY OTHER
MEASURE BY WHICH I HAVE A CHANCE OF DOING EQUAL GOOD?"

"NO, I CANNOT THINK OF ANYTHING ELSE."

"GIVE ME YOUR APPROBATION, THEN, FANNY. I AM NOT COMFORTABLE WITHOUT
IT."

"OH, COUSIN!"

"IF YOU ARE AGAINST ME, I OUGHT TO DISTRUST MYSELF, AND YET--BUT IT IS
ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE TO LET TOM GO ON IN THIS WAY, RIDING ABOUT THE
COUNTRY IN QUEST OF ANYBODY WHO CAN BE PERSUADED TO ACT--NO MATTER WHOM:
THE LOOK OF A GENTLEMAN IS TO BE ENOUGH. I THOUGHT YOU WOULD HAVE
ENTERED MORE INTO MISS CRAWFORD'S FEELINGS."

"NO DOUBT SHE WILL BE VERY GLAD. IT MUST BE A GREAT RELIEF TO HER," SAID
FANNY, TRYING FOR GREATER WARMTH OF MANNER.

"SHE NEVER APPEARED MORE AMIABLE THAN IN HER BEHAVIOUR TO YOU LAST
NIGHT. IT GAVE HER A VERY STRONG CLAIM ON MY GOODWILL."

"SHE WAS VERY KIND, INDEED, AND I AM GLAD TO HAVE HER SPARED"...

SHE COULD NOT FINISH THE GENEROUS EFFUSION. HER CONSCIENCE STOPT HER IN
THE MIDDLE, BUT EDMUND WAS SATISFIED.

"I SHALL WALK DOWN IMMEDIATELY AFTER BREAKFAST," SAID HE, "AND AM SURE
OF GIVING PLEASURE THERE. AND NOW, DEAR FANNY, I WILL NOT INTERRUPT YOU
ANY LONGER. YOU WANT TO BE READING. BUT I COULD NOT BE EASY TILL I HAD
SPOKEN TO YOU, AND COME TO A DECISION. SLEEPING OR WAKING, MY HEAD HAS
BEEN FULL OF THIS MATTER ALL NIGHT. IT IS AN EVIL, BUT I AM CERTAINLY
MAKING IT LESS THAN IT MIGHT BE. IF TOM IS UP, I SHALL GO TO HIM
DIRECTLY AND GET IT OVER, AND WHEN WE MEET AT BREAKFAST WE SHALL BE ALL
IN HIGH GOOD-HUMOUR AT THE PROSPECT OF ACTING THE FOOL TOGETHER WITH
SUCH UNANIMITY. YOU, IN THE MEANWHILE, WILL BE TAKING A TRIP INTO
CHINA, I SUPPOSE. HOW DOES LORD MACARTNEY GO ON?"--OPENING A VOLUME ON
THE TABLE AND THEN TAKING UP SOME OTHERS. "AND HERE ARE CRABBE'S TALES,
AND THE IDLER, AT HAND TO RELIEVE YOU, IF YOU TIRE OF YOUR GREAT BOOK. I
ADMIRE YOUR LITTLE ESTABLISHMENT EXCEEDINGLY; AND AS SOON AS I AM
GONE, YOU WILL EMPTY YOUR HEAD OF ALL THIS NONSENSE OF ACTING, AND SIT
COMFORTABLY DOWN TO YOUR TABLE. BUT DO NOT STAY HERE TO BE COLD."

HE WENT; BUT THERE WAS NO READING, NO CHINA, NO COMPOSURE FOR FANNY. HE
HAD TOLD HER THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY, THE MOST INCONCEIVABLE, THE MOST
UNWELCOME NEWS; AND SHE COULD THINK OF NOTHING ELSE. TO BE ACTING! AFTER
ALL HIS OBJECTIONS--OBJECTIONS SO JUST AND SO PUBLIC! AFTER ALL THAT SHE
HAD HEARD HIM SAY, AND SEEN HIM LOOK, AND KNOWN HIM TO BE FEELING. COULD
IT BE POSSIBLE? EDMUND SO INCONSISTENT! WAS HE NOT DECEIVING HIMSELF?
WAS HE NOT WRONG? ALAS! IT WAS ALL MISS CRAWFORD'S DOING. SHE HAD SEEN
HER INFLUENCE IN EVERY SPEECH, AND WAS MISERABLE. THE DOUBTS AND ALARMS
AS TO HER OWN CONDUCT, WHICH HAD PREVIOUSLY DISTRESSED HER, AND
WHICH HAD ALL SLEPT WHILE SHE LISTENED TO HIM, WERE BECOME OF LITTLE
CONSEQUENCE NOW. THIS DEEPER ANXIETY SWALLOWED THEM UP. THINGS SHOULD
TAKE THEIR COURSE; SHE CARED NOT HOW IT ENDED. HER COUSINS MIGHT ATTACK,
BUT COULD HARDLY TEASE HER. SHE WAS BEYOND THEIR REACH; AND IF AT LAST
OBLIGED TO YIELD--NO MATTER--IT WAS ALL MISERY NOW.



CHAPTER XVII

IT WAS, INDEED, A TRIUMPHANT DAY TO MR. BERTRAM AND MARIA. SUCH A
VICTORY OVER EDMUND'S DISCRETION HAD BEEN BEYOND THEIR HOPES, AND WAS
MOST DELIGHTFUL. THERE WAS NO LONGER ANYTHING TO DISTURB THEM IN THEIR
DARLING PROJECT, AND THEY CONGRATULATED EACH OTHER IN PRIVATE ON THE
JEALOUS WEAKNESS TO WHICH THEY ATTRIBUTED THE CHANGE, WITH ALL THE GLEE
OF FEELINGS GRATIFIED IN EVERY WAY. EDMUND MIGHT STILL LOOK GRAVE, AND
SAY HE DID NOT LIKE THE SCHEME IN GENERAL, AND MUST DISAPPROVE THE PLAY
IN PARTICULAR; THEIR POINT WAS GAINED: HE WAS TO ACT, AND HE WAS DRIVEN
TO IT BY THE FORCE OF SELFISH INCLINATIONS ONLY. EDMUND HAD DESCENDED
FROM THAT MORAL ELEVATION WHICH HE HAD MAINTAINED BEFORE, AND THEY WERE
BOTH AS MUCH THE BETTER AS THE HAPPIER FOR THE DESCENT.

THEY BEHAVED VERY WELL, HOWEVER, TO HIM ON THE OCCASION, BETRAYING NO
EXULTATION BEYOND THE LINES ABOUT THE CORNERS OF THE MOUTH, AND SEEMED
TO THINK IT AS GREAT AN ESCAPE TO BE QUIT OF THE INTRUSION OF CHARLES
MADDOX, AS IF THEY HAD BEEN FORCED INTO ADMITTING HIM AGAINST THEIR
INCLINATION. "TO HAVE IT QUITE IN THEIR OWN FAMILY CIRCLE WAS WHAT
THEY HAD PARTICULARLY WISHED. A STRANGER AMONG THEM WOULD HAVE BEEN THE
DESTRUCTION OF ALL THEIR COMFORT"; AND WHEN EDMUND, PURSUING THAT IDEA,
GAVE A HINT OF HIS HOPE AS TO THE LIMITATION OF THE AUDIENCE, THEY WERE
READY, IN THE COMPLAISANCE OF THE MOMENT, TO PROMISE ANYTHING. IT WAS
ALL GOOD-HUMOUR AND ENCOURAGEMENT. MRS. NORRIS OFFERED TO CONTRIVE HIS
DRESS, MR. YATES ASSURED HIM THAT ANHALT'S LAST SCENE WITH THE BARON
ADMITTED A GOOD DEAL OF ACTION AND EMPHASIS, AND MR. RUSHWORTH UNDERTOOK
TO COUNT HIS SPEECHES.

"PERHAPS," SAID TOM, "FANNY MAY BE MORE DISPOSED TO OBLIGE US NOW.
PERHAPS YOU MAY PERSUADE HER."

"NO, SHE IS QUITE DETERMINED. SHE CERTAINLY WILL NOT ACT."

"OH! VERY WELL." AND NOT ANOTHER WORD WAS SAID; BUT FANNY FELT HERSELF
AGAIN IN DANGER, AND HER INDIFFERENCE TO THE DANGER WAS BEGINNING TO
FAIL HER ALREADY.

THERE WERE NOT FEWER SMILES AT THE PARSONAGE THAN AT THE PARK ON THIS
CHANGE IN EDMUND; MISS CRAWFORD LOOKED VERY LOVELY IN HERS, AND ENTERED
WITH SUCH AN INSTANTANEOUS RENEWAL OF CHEERFULNESS INTO THE WHOLE
AFFAIR AS COULD HAVE BUT ONE EFFECT ON HIM. "HE WAS CERTAINLY RIGHT IN
RESPECTING SUCH FEELINGS; HE WAS GLAD HE HAD DETERMINED ON IT." AND THE
MORNING WORE AWAY IN SATISFACTIONS VERY SWEET, IF NOT VERY SOUND. ONE
ADVANTAGE RESULTED FROM IT TO FANNY: AT THE EARNEST REQUEST OF MISS
CRAWFORD, MRS. GRANT HAD, WITH HER USUAL GOOD-HUMOUR, AGREED TO
UNDERTAKE THE PART FOR WHICH FANNY HAD BEEN WANTED; AND THIS WAS ALL
THAT OCCURRED TO GLADDEN HER HEART DURING THE DAY; AND EVEN THIS, WHEN
IMPARTED BY EDMUND, BROUGHT A PANG WITH IT, FOR IT WAS MISS CRAWFORD TO
WHOM SHE WAS OBLIGED--IT WAS MISS CRAWFORD WHOSE KIND EXERTIONS WERE TO
EXCITE HER GRATITUDE, AND WHOSE MERIT IN MAKING THEM WAS SPOKEN OF
WITH A GLOW OF ADMIRATION. SHE WAS SAFE; BUT PEACE AND SAFETY WERE
UNCONNECTED HERE. HER MIND HAD BEEN NEVER FARTHER FROM PEACE. SHE COULD
NOT FEEL THAT SHE HAD DONE WRONG HERSELF, BUT SHE WAS DISQUIETED
IN EVERY OTHER WAY. HER HEART AND HER JUDGMENT WERE EQUALLY AGAINST
EDMUND'S DECISION: SHE COULD NOT ACQUIT HIS UNSTEADINESS, AND HIS
HAPPINESS UNDER IT MADE HER WRETCHED. SHE WAS FULL OF JEALOUSY AND
AGITATION. MISS CRAWFORD CAME WITH LOOKS OF GAIETY WHICH SEEMED AN
INSULT, WITH FRIENDLY EXPRESSIONS TOWARDS HERSELF WHICH SHE COULD HARDLY
ANSWER CALMLY. EVERYBODY AROUND HER WAS GAY AND BUSY, PROSPEROUS AND
IMPORTANT; EACH HAD THEIR OBJECT OF INTEREST, THEIR PART, THEIR DRESS,
THEIR FAVOURITE SCENE, THEIR FRIENDS AND CONFEDERATES: ALL WERE FINDING
EMPLOYMENT IN CONSULTATIONS AND COMPARISONS, OR DIVERSION IN THE PLAYFUL
CONCEITS THEY SUGGESTED. SHE ALONE WAS SAD AND INSIGNIFICANT: SHE HAD
NO SHARE IN ANYTHING; SHE MIGHT GO OR STAY; SHE MIGHT BE IN THE MIDST
OF THEIR NOISE, OR RETREAT FROM IT TO THE SOLITUDE OF THE EAST ROOM,
WITHOUT BEING SEEN OR MISSED. SHE COULD ALMOST THINK ANYTHING WOULD
HAVE BEEN PREFERABLE TO THIS. MRS. GRANT WAS OF CONSEQUENCE: HER
GOOD-NATURE HAD HONOURABLE MENTION; HER TASTE AND HER TIME WERE
CONSIDERED; HER PRESENCE WAS WANTED; SHE WAS SOUGHT FOR, AND ATTENDED,
AND PRAISED; AND FANNY WAS AT FIRST IN SOME DANGER OF ENVYING HER THE
CHARACTER SHE HAD ACCEPTED. BUT REFLECTION BROUGHT BETTER FEELINGS, AND
SHEWED HER THAT MRS. GRANT WAS ENTITLED TO RESPECT, WHICH COULD NEVER
HAVE BELONGED TO HER; AND THAT, HAD SHE RECEIVED EVEN THE GREATEST,
SHE COULD NEVER HAVE BEEN EASY IN JOINING A SCHEME WHICH, CONSIDERING
ONLY HER UNCLE, SHE MUST CONDEMN ALTOGETHER.

FANNY'S HEART WAS NOT ABSOLUTELY THE ONLY SADDENED ONE AMONGST THEM,
AS SHE SOON BEGAN TO ACKNOWLEDGE TO HERSELF. JULIA WAS A SUFFERER TOO,
THOUGH NOT QUITE SO BLAMELESSLY.

HENRY CRAWFORD HAD TRIFLED WITH HER FEELINGS; BUT SHE HAD VERY LONG
ALLOWED AND EVEN SOUGHT HIS ATTENTIONS, WITH A JEALOUSY OF HER SISTER SO
REASONABLE AS OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN THEIR CURE; AND NOW THAT THE CONVICTION
OF HIS PREFERENCE FOR MARIA HAD BEEN FORCED ON HER, SHE SUBMITTED TO IT
WITHOUT ANY ALARM FOR MARIA'S SITUATION, OR ANY ENDEAVOUR AT RATIONAL
TRANQUILLITY FOR HERSELF. SHE EITHER SAT IN GLOOMY SILENCE, WRAPT IN
SUCH GRAVITY AS NOTHING COULD SUBDUE, NO CURIOSITY TOUCH, NO WIT AMUSE;
OR ALLOWING THE ATTENTIONS OF MR. YATES, WAS TALKING WITH FORCED GAIETY
TO HIM ALONE, AND RIDICULING THE ACTING OF THE OTHERS.

FOR A DAY OR TWO AFTER THE AFFRONT WAS GIVEN, HENRY CRAWFORD HAD
ENDEAVOURED TO DO IT AWAY BY THE USUAL ATTACK OF GALLANTRY AND
COMPLIMENT, BUT HE HAD NOT CARED ENOUGH ABOUT IT TO PERSEVERE AGAINST A
FEW REPULSES; AND BECOMING SOON TOO BUSY WITH HIS PLAY TO HAVE TIME FOR
MORE THAN ONE FLIRTATION, HE GREW INDIFFERENT TO THE QUARREL, OR RATHER
THOUGHT IT A LUCKY OCCURRENCE, AS QUIETLY PUTTING AN END TO WHAT MIGHT
ERE LONG HAVE RAISED EXPECTATIONS IN MORE THAN MRS. GRANT. SHE WAS NOT
PLEASED TO SEE JULIA EXCLUDED FROM THE PLAY, AND SITTING BY DISREGARDED;
BUT AS IT WAS NOT A MATTER WHICH REALLY INVOLVED HER HAPPINESS, AS HENRY
MUST BE THE BEST JUDGE OF HIS OWN, AND AS HE DID ASSURE HER, WITH A
MOST PERSUASIVE SMILE, THAT NEITHER HE NOR JULIA HAD EVER HAD A SERIOUS
THOUGHT OF EACH OTHER, SHE COULD ONLY RENEW HER FORMER CAUTION AS TO
THE ELDER SISTER, ENTREAT HIM NOT TO RISK HIS TRANQUILLITY BY TOO
MUCH ADMIRATION THERE, AND THEN GLADLY TAKE HER SHARE IN ANYTHING THAT
BROUGHT CHEERFULNESS TO THE YOUNG PEOPLE IN GENERAL, AND THAT DID SO
PARTICULARLY PROMOTE THE PLEASURE OF THE TWO SO DEAR TO HER.

"I RATHER WONDER JULIA IS NOT IN LOVE WITH HENRY," WAS HER OBSERVATION
TO MARY.

"I DARE SAY SHE IS," REPLIED MARY COLDLY. "I IMAGINE BOTH SISTERS ARE."

"BOTH! NO, NO, THAT MUST NOT BE. DO NOT GIVE HIM A HINT OF IT. THINK OF
MR. RUSHWORTH!"

"YOU HAD BETTER TELL MISS BERTRAM TO THINK OF MR. RUSHWORTH. IT MAY
DO HER SOME GOOD. I OFTEN THINK OF MR. RUSHWORTH'S PROPERTY AND
INDEPENDENCE, AND WISH THEM IN OTHER HANDS; BUT I NEVER THINK OF HIM. A
MAN MIGHT REPRESENT THE COUNTY WITH SUCH AN ESTATE; A MAN MIGHT ESCAPE A
PROFESSION AND REPRESENT THE COUNTY."

"I DARE SAY HE WILL BE IN PARLIAMENT SOON. WHEN SIR THOMAS COMES, I
DARE SAY HE WILL BE IN FOR SOME BOROUGH, BUT THERE HAS BEEN NOBODY TO
PUT HIM IN THE WAY OF DOING ANYTHING YET."

"SIR THOMAS IS TO ACHIEVE MANY MIGHTY THINGS WHEN HE COMES HOME," SAID
MARY, AFTER A PAUSE. "DO YOU REMEMBER HAWKINS BROWNE'S 'ADDRESS TO
TOBACCO,' IN IMITATION OF POPE?--

     BLEST LEAF! WHOSE AROMATIC GALES DISPENSE
     TO TEMPLARS MODESTY, TO PARSONS SENSE.

I WILL PARODY THEM--

     BLEST KNIGHT! WHOSE DICTATORIAL LOOKS DISPENSE
     TO CHILDREN AFFLUENCE, TO RUSHWORTH SENSE.

WILL NOT THAT DO, MRS. GRANT? EVERYTHING SEEMS TO DEPEND UPON SIR
THOMAS'S RETURN."

"YOU WILL FIND HIS CONSEQUENCE VERY JUST AND REASONABLE WHEN YOU SEE HIM
IN HIS FAMILY, I ASSURE YOU. I DO NOT THINK WE DO SO WELL WITHOUT HIM.
HE HAS A FINE DIGNIFIED MANNER, WHICH SUITS THE HEAD OF SUCH A HOUSE,
AND KEEPS EVERYBODY IN THEIR PLACE. LADY BERTRAM SEEMS MORE OF A CIPHER
NOW THAN WHEN HE IS AT HOME; AND NOBODY ELSE CAN KEEP MRS. NORRIS IN
ORDER. BUT, MARY, DO NOT FANCY THAT MARIA BERTRAM CARES FOR HENRY. I
AM SURE JULIA DOES NOT, OR SHE WOULD NOT HAVE FLIRTED AS SHE DID LAST
NIGHT WITH MR. YATES; AND THOUGH HE AND MARIA ARE VERY GOOD FRIENDS, I
THINK SHE LIKES SOTHERTON TOO WELL TO BE INCONSTANT."

"I WOULD NOT GIVE MUCH FOR MR. RUSHWORTH'S CHANCE IF HENRY STEPT IN
BEFORE THE ARTICLES WERE SIGNED."

"IF YOU HAVE SUCH A SUSPICION, SOMETHING MUST BE DONE; AND AS SOON AS
THE PLAY IS ALL OVER, WE WILL TALK TO HIM SERIOUSLY AND MAKE HIM KNOW
HIS OWN MIND; AND IF HE MEANS NOTHING, WE WILL SEND HIM OFF, THOUGH HE
IS HENRY, FOR A TIME."

JULIA DID SUFFER, HOWEVER, THOUGH MRS. GRANT DISCERNED IT NOT, AND
THOUGH IT ESCAPED THE NOTICE OF MANY OF HER OWN FAMILY LIKEWISE. SHE HAD
LOVED, SHE DID LOVE STILL, AND SHE HAD ALL THE SUFFERING WHICH A WARM
TEMPER AND A HIGH SPIRIT WERE LIKELY TO ENDURE UNDER THE DISAPPOINTMENT
OF A DEAR, THOUGH IRRATIONAL HOPE, WITH A STRONG SENSE OF ILL-USAGE.
HER HEART WAS SORE AND ANGRY, AND SHE WAS CAPABLE ONLY OF ANGRY
CONSOLATIONS. THE SISTER WITH WHOM SHE WAS USED TO BE ON EASY TERMS WAS
NOW BECOME HER GREATEST ENEMY: THEY WERE ALIENATED FROM EACH OTHER;
AND JULIA WAS NOT SUPERIOR TO THE HOPE OF SOME DISTRESSING END TO THE
ATTENTIONS WHICH WERE STILL CARRYING ON THERE, SOME PUNISHMENT TO
MARIA FOR CONDUCT SO SHAMEFUL TOWARDS HERSELF AS WELL AS TOWARDS MR.
RUSHWORTH. WITH NO MATERIAL FAULT OF TEMPER, OR DIFFERENCE OF OPINION,
TO PREVENT THEIR BEING VERY GOOD FRIENDS WHILE THEIR INTERESTS WERE
THE SAME, THE SISTERS, UNDER SUCH A TRIAL AS THIS, HAD NOT AFFECTION OR
PRINCIPLE ENOUGH TO MAKE THEM MERCIFUL OR JUST, TO GIVE THEM HONOUR OR
COMPASSION. MARIA FELT HER TRIUMPH, AND PURSUED HER PURPOSE, CARELESS OF
JULIA; AND JULIA COULD NEVER SEE MARIA DISTINGUISHED BY HENRY CRAWFORD
WITHOUT TRUSTING THAT IT WOULD CREATE JEALOUSY, AND BRING A PUBLIC
DISTURBANCE AT LAST.

FANNY SAW AND PITIED MUCH OF THIS IN JULIA; BUT THERE WAS NO OUTWARD
FELLOWSHIP BETWEEN THEM. JULIA MADE NO COMMUNICATION, AND FANNY TOOK
NO LIBERTIES. THEY WERE TWO SOLITARY SUFFERERS, OR CONNECTED ONLY BY
FANNY'S CONSCIOUSNESS.

THE INATTENTION OF THE TWO BROTHERS AND THE AUNT TO JULIA'S
DISCOMPOSURE, AND THEIR BLINDNESS TO ITS TRUE CAUSE, MUST BE IMPUTED TO
THE FULLNESS OF THEIR OWN MINDS. THEY WERE TOTALLY PREOCCUPIED. TOM WAS
ENGROSSED BY THE CONCERNS OF HIS THEATRE, AND SAW NOTHING THAT DID NOT
IMMEDIATELY RELATE TO IT. EDMUND, BETWEEN HIS THEATRICAL AND HIS REAL
PART, BETWEEN MISS CRAWFORD'S CLAIMS AND HIS OWN CONDUCT, BETWEEN LOVE
AND CONSISTENCY, WAS EQUALLY UNOBSERVANT; AND MRS. NORRIS WAS TOO BUSY
IN CONTRIVING AND DIRECTING THE GENERAL LITTLE MATTERS OF THE COMPANY,
SUPERINTENDING THEIR VARIOUS DRESSES WITH ECONOMICAL EXPEDIENT, FOR
WHICH NOBODY THANKED HER, AND SAVING, WITH DELIGHTED INTEGRITY, HALF
A CROWN HERE AND THERE TO THE ABSENT SIR THOMAS, TO HAVE LEISURE FOR
WATCHING THE BEHAVIOUR, OR GUARDING THE HAPPINESS OF HIS DAUGHTERS.



CHAPTER XVIII

EVERYTHING WAS NOW IN A REGULAR TRAIN: THEATRE, ACTORS, ACTRESSES, AND
DRESSES, WERE ALL GETTING FORWARD; BUT THOUGH NO OTHER GREAT IMPEDIMENTS
AROSE, FANNY FOUND, BEFORE MANY DAYS WERE PAST, THAT IT WAS NOT ALL
UNINTERRUPTED ENJOYMENT TO THE PARTY THEMSELVES, AND THAT SHE HAD NOT TO
WITNESS THE CONTINUANCE OF SUCH UNANIMITY AND DELIGHT AS HAD BEEN ALMOST
TOO MUCH FOR HER AT FIRST. EVERYBODY BEGAN TO HAVE THEIR VEXATION.
EDMUND HAD MANY. ENTIRELY AGAINST HIS JUDGMENT, A SCENE-PAINTER
ARRIVED FROM TOWN, AND WAS AT WORK, MUCH TO THE INCREASE OF THE
EXPENSES, AND, WHAT WAS WORSE, OF THE ECLAT OF THEIR PROCEEDINGS; AND
HIS BROTHER, INSTEAD OF BEING REALLY GUIDED BY HIM AS TO THE PRIVACY OF
THE REPRESENTATION, WAS GIVING AN INVITATION TO EVERY FAMILY WHO CAME
IN HIS WAY. TOM HIMSELF BEGAN TO FRET OVER THE SCENE-PAINTER'S SLOW
PROGRESS, AND TO FEEL THE MISERIES OF WAITING. HE HAD LEARNED HIS
PART--ALL HIS PARTS, FOR HE TOOK EVERY TRIFLING ONE THAT COULD BE UNITED
WITH THE BUTLER, AND BEGAN TO BE IMPATIENT TO BE ACTING; AND EVERY DAY
THUS UNEMPLOYED WAS TENDING TO INCREASE HIS SENSE OF THE INSIGNIFICANCE
OF ALL HIS PARTS TOGETHER, AND MAKE HIM MORE READY TO REGRET THAT SOME
OTHER PLAY HAD NOT BEEN CHOSEN.

FANNY, BEING ALWAYS A VERY COURTEOUS LISTENER, AND OFTEN THE ONLY
LISTENER AT HAND, CAME IN FOR THE COMPLAINTS AND THE DISTRESSES OF
MOST OF THEM. SHE KNEW THAT MR. YATES WAS IN GENERAL THOUGHT TO RANT
DREADFULLY; THAT MR. YATES WAS DISAPPOINTED IN HENRY CRAWFORD; THAT
TOM BERTRAM SPOKE SO QUICK HE WOULD BE UNINTELLIGIBLE; THAT MRS. GRANT
SPOILED EVERYTHING BY LAUGHING; THAT EDMUND WAS BEHINDHAND WITH HIS
PART, AND THAT IT WAS MISERY TO HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH MR. RUSHWORTH,
WHO WAS WANTING A PROMPTER THROUGH EVERY SPEECH. SHE KNEW, ALSO, THAT
POOR MR. RUSHWORTH COULD SELDOM GET ANYBODY TO REHEARSE WITH HIM: HIS
COMPLAINT CAME BEFORE HER AS WELL AS THE REST; AND SO DECIDED TO HER
EYE WAS HER COUSIN MARIA'S AVOIDANCE OF HIM, AND SO NEEDLESSLY OFTEN THE
REHEARSAL OF THE FIRST SCENE BETWEEN HER AND MR. CRAWFORD, THAT SHE HAD
SOON ALL THE TERROR OF OTHER COMPLAINTS FROM HIM. SO FAR FROM BEING
ALL SATISFIED AND ALL ENJOYING, SHE FOUND EVERYBODY REQUIRING SOMETHING
THEY HAD NOT, AND GIVING OCCASION OF DISCONTENT TO THE OTHERS. EVERYBODY
HAD A PART EITHER TOO LONG OR TOO SHORT; NOBODY WOULD ATTEND AS THEY
OUGHT; NOBODY WOULD REMEMBER ON WHICH SIDE THEY WERE TO COME IN; NOBODY
BUT THE COMPLAINER WOULD OBSERVE ANY DIRECTIONS.

FANNY BELIEVED HERSELF TO DERIVE AS MUCH INNOCENT ENJOYMENT FROM THE
PLAY AS ANY OF THEM; HENRY CRAWFORD ACTED WELL, AND IT WAS A PLEASURE TO
HER TO CREEP INTO THE THEATRE, AND ATTEND THE REHEARSAL OF THE FIRST
ACT, IN SPITE OF THE FEELINGS IT EXCITED IN SOME SPEECHES FOR MARIA.
MARIA, SHE ALSO THOUGHT, ACTED WELL, TOO WELL; AND AFTER THE FIRST
REHEARSAL OR TWO, FANNY BEGAN TO BE THEIR ONLY AUDIENCE; AND SOMETIMES
AS PROMPTER, SOMETIMES AS SPECTATOR, WAS OFTEN VERY USEFUL. AS FAR AS
SHE COULD JUDGE, MR. CRAWFORD WAS CONSIDERABLY THE BEST ACTOR OF ALL: HE
HAD MORE CONFIDENCE THAN EDMUND, MORE JUDGMENT THAN TOM, MORE TALENT AND
TASTE THAN MR. YATES. SHE DID NOT LIKE HIM AS A MAN, BUT SHE MUST ADMIT
HIM TO BE THE BEST ACTOR, AND ON THIS POINT THERE WERE NOT MANY WHO
DIFFERED FROM HER. MR. YATES, INDEED, EXCLAIMED AGAINST HIS TAMENESS AND
INSIPIDITY; AND THE DAY CAME AT LAST, WHEN MR. RUSHWORTH TURNED TO HER
WITH A BLACK LOOK, AND SAID, "DO YOU THINK THERE IS ANYTHING SO VERY
FINE IN ALL THIS? FOR THE LIFE AND SOUL OF ME, I CANNOT ADMIRE HIM; AND,
BETWEEN OURSELVES, TO SEE SUCH AN UNDERSIZED, LITTLE, MEAN-LOOKING MAN,
SET UP FOR A FINE ACTOR, IS VERY RIDICULOUS IN MY OPINION."

FROM THIS MOMENT THERE WAS A RETURN OF HIS FORMER JEALOUSY, WHICH MARIA,
FROM INCREASING HOPES OF CRAWFORD, WAS AT LITTLE PAINS TO REMOVE; AND
THE CHANCES OF MR. RUSHWORTH'S EVER ATTAINING TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF HIS
TWO-AND-FORTY SPEECHES BECAME MUCH LESS. AS TO HIS EVER MAKING ANYTHING
TOLERABLE OF THEM, NOBODY HAD THE SMALLEST IDEA OF THAT EXCEPT
HIS MOTHER; SHE, INDEED, REGRETTED THAT HIS PART WAS NOT MORE
CONSIDERABLE, AND DEFERRED COMING OVER TO MANSFIELD TILL THEY WERE
FORWARD ENOUGH IN THEIR REHEARSAL TO COMPREHEND ALL HIS SCENES; BUT THE
OTHERS ASPIRED AT NOTHING BEYOND HIS REMEMBERING THE CATCHWORD, AND THE
FIRST LINE OF HIS SPEECH, AND BEING ABLE TO FOLLOW THE PROMPTER THROUGH
THE REST. FANNY, IN HER PITY AND KINDHEARTEDNESS, WAS AT GREAT PAINS TO
TEACH HIM HOW TO LEARN, GIVING HIM ALL THE HELPS AND DIRECTIONS IN HER
POWER, TRYING TO MAKE AN ARTIFICIAL MEMORY FOR HIM, AND LEARNING EVERY
WORD OF HIS PART HERSELF, BUT WITHOUT HIS BEING MUCH THE FORWARDER.

MANY UNCOMFORTABLE, ANXIOUS, APPREHENSIVE FEELINGS SHE CERTAINLY HAD;
BUT WITH ALL THESE, AND OTHER CLAIMS ON HER TIME AND ATTENTION, SHE WAS
AS FAR FROM FINDING HERSELF WITHOUT EMPLOYMENT OR UTILITY AMONGST THEM,
AS WITHOUT A COMPANION IN UNEASINESS; QUITE AS FAR FROM HAVING NO
DEMAND ON HER LEISURE AS ON HER COMPASSION. THE GLOOM OF HER FIRST
ANTICIPATIONS WAS PROVED TO HAVE BEEN UNFOUNDED. SHE WAS OCCASIONALLY
USEFUL TO ALL; SHE WAS PERHAPS AS MUCH AT PEACE AS ANY.

THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF NEEDLEWORK TO BE DONE, MOREOVER, IN WHICH HER
HELP WAS WANTED; AND THAT MRS. NORRIS THOUGHT HER QUITE AS WELL OFF
AS THE REST, WAS EVIDENT BY THE MANNER IN WHICH SHE CLAIMED IT--"COME,
FANNY," SHE CRIED, "THESE ARE FINE TIMES FOR YOU, BUT YOU MUST NOT BE
ALWAYS WALKING FROM ONE ROOM TO THE OTHER, AND DOING THE LOOKINGS-ON AT
YOUR EASE, IN THIS WAY; I WANT YOU HERE. I HAVE BEEN SLAVING MYSELF TILL
I CAN HARDLY STAND, TO CONTRIVE MR. RUSHWORTH'S CLOAK WITHOUT SENDING
FOR ANY MORE SATIN; AND NOW I THINK YOU MAY GIVE ME YOUR HELP IN PUTTING
IT TOGETHER. THERE ARE BUT THREE SEAMS; YOU MAY DO THEM IN A TRICE. IT
WOULD BE LUCKY FOR ME IF I HAD NOTHING BUT THE EXECUTIVE PART TO DO.
YOU ARE BEST OFF, I CAN TELL YOU: BUT IF NOBODY DID MORE THAN YOU,
WE SHOULD NOT GET ON VERY FAST."

FANNY TOOK THE WORK VERY QUIETLY, WITHOUT ATTEMPTING ANY DEFENCE; BUT
HER KINDER AUNT BERTRAM OBSERVED ON HER BEHALF--

"ONE CANNOT WONDER, SISTER, THAT FANNY SHOULD BE DELIGHTED: IT IS
ALL NEW TO HER, YOU KNOW; YOU AND I USED TO BE VERY FOND OF A PLAY
OURSELVES, AND SO AM I STILL; AND AS SOON AS I AM A LITTLE MORE AT
LEISURE, I MEAN TO LOOK IN AT THEIR REHEARSALS TOO. WHAT IS THE PLAY
ABOUT, FANNY? YOU HAVE NEVER TOLD ME."

"OH! SISTER, PRAY DO NOT ASK HER NOW; FOR FANNY IS NOT ONE OF THOSE WHO
CAN TALK AND WORK AT THE SAME TIME. IT IS ABOUT LOVERS' VOWS."

"I BELIEVE," SAID FANNY TO HER AUNT BERTRAM, "THERE WILL BE THREE ACTS
REHEARSED TO-MORROW EVENING, AND THAT WILL GIVE YOU AN OPPORTUNITY OF
SEEING ALL THE ACTORS AT ONCE."

"YOU HAD BETTER STAY TILL THE CURTAIN IS HUNG," INTERPOSED MRS. NORRIS;
"THE CURTAIN WILL BE HUNG IN A DAY OR TWO--THERE IS VERY LITTLE SENSE IN
A PLAY WITHOUT A CURTAIN--AND I AM MUCH MISTAKEN IF YOU DO NOT FIND IT
DRAW UP INTO VERY HANDSOME FESTOONS."

LADY BERTRAM SEEMED QUITE RESIGNED TO WAITING. FANNY DID NOT SHARE HER
AUNT'S COMPOSURE: SHE THOUGHT OF THE MORROW A GREAT DEAL, FOR IF THE
THREE ACTS WERE REHEARSED, EDMUND AND MISS CRAWFORD WOULD THEN BE ACTING
TOGETHER FOR THE FIRST TIME; THE THIRD ACT WOULD BRING A SCENE BETWEEN
THEM WHICH INTERESTED HER MOST PARTICULARLY, AND WHICH SHE WAS LONGING
AND DREADING TO SEE HOW THEY WOULD PERFORM. THE WHOLE SUBJECT OF IT WAS
LOVE--A MARRIAGE OF LOVE WAS TO BE DESCRIBED BY THE GENTLEMAN, AND VERY
LITTLE SHORT OF A DECLARATION OF LOVE BE MADE BY THE LADY.

SHE HAD READ AND READ THE SCENE AGAIN WITH MANY PAINFUL, MANY WONDERING
EMOTIONS, AND LOOKED FORWARD TO THEIR REPRESENTATION OF IT AS A
CIRCUMSTANCE ALMOST TOO INTERESTING. SHE DID NOT BELIEVE THEY HAD YET
REHEARSED IT, EVEN IN PRIVATE.

THE MORROW CAME, THE PLAN FOR THE EVENING CONTINUED, AND FANNY'S
CONSIDERATION OF IT DID NOT BECOME LESS AGITATED. SHE WORKED VERY
DILIGENTLY UNDER HER AUNT'S DIRECTIONS, BUT HER DILIGENCE AND HER
SILENCE CONCEALED A VERY ABSENT, ANXIOUS MIND; AND ABOUT NOON SHE
MADE HER ESCAPE WITH HER WORK TO THE EAST ROOM, THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE NO
CONCERN IN ANOTHER, AND, AS SHE DEEMED IT, MOST UNNECESSARY REHEARSAL OF
THE FIRST ACT, WHICH HENRY CRAWFORD WAS JUST PROPOSING, DESIROUS AT
ONCE OF HAVING HER TIME TO HERSELF, AND OF AVOIDING THE SIGHT OF MR.
RUSHWORTH. A GLIMPSE, AS SHE PASSED THROUGH THE HALL, OF THE TWO LADIES
WALKING UP FROM THE PARSONAGE MADE NO CHANGE IN HER WISH OF RETREAT, AND
SHE WORKED AND MEDITATED IN THE EAST ROOM, UNDISTURBED, FOR A QUARTER OF
AN HOUR, WHEN A GENTLE TAP AT THE DOOR WAS FOLLOWED BY THE ENTRANCE OF
MISS CRAWFORD.

"AM I RIGHT? YES; THIS IS THE EAST ROOM. MY DEAR MISS PRICE, I BEG YOUR
PARDON, BUT I HAVE MADE MY WAY TO YOU ON PURPOSE TO ENTREAT YOUR HELP."

FANNY, QUITE SURPRISED, ENDEAVOURED TO SHEW HERSELF MISTRESS OF THE ROOM
BY HER CIVILITIES, AND LOOKED AT THE BRIGHT BARS OF HER EMPTY GRATE WITH
CONCERN.

"THANK YOU; I AM QUITE WARM, VERY WARM. ALLOW ME TO STAY HERE A LITTLE
WHILE, AND DO HAVE THE GOODNESS TO HEAR ME MY THIRD ACT. I HAVE BROUGHT
MY BOOK, AND IF YOU WOULD BUT REHEARSE IT WITH ME, I SHOULD BE SO
OBLIGED! I CAME HERE TO-DAY INTENDING TO REHEARSE IT WITH EDMUND--BY
OURSELVES--AGAINST THE EVENING, BUT HE IS NOT IN THE WAY; AND IF HE
WERE, I DO NOT THINK I COULD GO THROUGH IT WITH HIM, TILL I HAVE
HARDENED MYSELF A LITTLE; FOR REALLY THERE IS A SPEECH OR TWO. YOU WILL
BE SO GOOD, WON'T YOU?"

FANNY WAS MOST CIVIL IN HER ASSURANCES, THOUGH SHE COULD NOT GIVE THEM
IN A VERY STEADY VOICE.

"HAVE YOU EVER HAPPENED TO LOOK AT THE PART I MEAN?" CONTINUED MISS
CRAWFORD, OPENING HER BOOK. "HERE IT IS. I DID NOT THINK MUCH OF IT AT
FIRST--BUT, UPON MY WORD. THERE, LOOK AT THAT SPEECH, AND THAT, AND
THAT. HOW AM I EVER TO LOOK HIM IN THE FACE AND SAY SUCH THINGS? COULD
YOU DO IT? BUT THEN HE IS YOUR COUSIN, WHICH MAKES ALL THE DIFFERENCE.
YOU MUST REHEARSE IT WITH ME, THAT I MAY FANCY YOU HIM, AND GET ON BY
DEGREES. YOU HAVE A LOOK OF HIS SOMETIMES."

"HAVE I? I WILL DO MY BEST WITH THE GREATEST READINESS; BUT I MUST
READ THE PART, FOR I CAN SAY VERY LITTLE OF IT."

"NONE OF IT, I SUPPOSE. YOU ARE TO HAVE THE BOOK, OF COURSE. NOW FOR
IT. WE MUST HAVE TWO CHAIRS AT HAND FOR YOU TO BRING FORWARD TO THE
FRONT OF THE STAGE. THERE--VERY GOOD SCHOOL-ROOM CHAIRS, NOT MADE FOR A
THEATRE, I DARE SAY; MUCH MORE FITTED FOR LITTLE GIRLS TO SIT AND KICK
THEIR FEET AGAINST WHEN THEY ARE LEARNING A LESSON. WHAT WOULD YOUR
GOVERNESS AND YOUR UNCLE SAY TO SEE THEM USED FOR SUCH A PURPOSE? COULD
SIR THOMAS LOOK IN UPON US JUST NOW, HE WOULD BLESS HIMSELF, FOR WE
ARE REHEARSING ALL OVER THE HOUSE. YATES IS STORMING AWAY IN THE
DINING-ROOM. I HEARD HIM AS I CAME UPSTAIRS, AND THE THEATRE IS ENGAGED
OF COURSE BY THOSE INDEFATIGABLE REHEARSERS, AGATHA AND FREDERICK. IF
THEY ARE NOT PERFECT, I SHALL BE SURPRISED. BY THE BYE, I LOOKED IN
UPON THEM FIVE MINUTES AGO, AND IT HAPPENED TO BE EXACTLY AT ONE OF THE
TIMES WHEN THEY WERE TRYING NOT TO EMBRACE, AND MR. RUSHWORTH WAS WITH
ME. I THOUGHT HE BEGAN TO LOOK A LITTLE QUEER, SO I TURNED IT OFF AS
WELL AS I COULD, BY WHISPERING TO HIM, 'WE SHALL HAVE AN EXCELLENT
AGATHA; THERE IS SOMETHING SO MATERNAL IN HER MANNER, SO COMPLETELY
MATERNAL IN HER VOICE AND COUNTENANCE.' WAS NOT THAT WELL DONE OF ME?
HE BRIGHTENED UP DIRECTLY. NOW FOR MY SOLILOQUY."

SHE BEGAN, AND FANNY JOINED IN WITH ALL THE MODEST FEELING WHICH THE
IDEA OF REPRESENTING EDMUND WAS SO STRONGLY CALCULATED TO INSPIRE; BUT
WITH LOOKS AND VOICE SO TRULY FEMININE AS TO BE NO VERY GOOD PICTURE OF
A MAN. WITH SUCH AN ANHALT, HOWEVER, MISS CRAWFORD HAD COURAGE ENOUGH;
AND THEY HAD GOT THROUGH HALF THE SCENE, WHEN A TAP AT THE DOOR BROUGHT
A PAUSE, AND THE ENTRANCE OF EDMUND, THE NEXT MOMENT, SUSPENDED IT ALL.

SURPRISE, CONSCIOUSNESS, AND PLEASURE APPEARED IN EACH OF THE THREE
ON THIS UNEXPECTED MEETING; AND AS EDMUND WAS COME ON THE VERY SAME
BUSINESS THAT HAD BROUGHT MISS CRAWFORD, CONSCIOUSNESS AND PLEASURE WERE
LIKELY TO BE MORE THAN MOMENTARY IN THEM. HE TOO HAD HIS BOOK, AND WAS
SEEKING FANNY, TO ASK HER TO REHEARSE WITH HIM, AND HELP HIM TO PREPARE
FOR THE EVENING, WITHOUT KNOWING MISS CRAWFORD TO BE IN THE HOUSE;
AND GREAT WAS THE JOY AND ANIMATION OF BEING THUS THROWN TOGETHER, OF
COMPARING SCHEMES, AND SYMPATHISING IN PRAISE OF FANNY'S KIND OFFICES.

SHE COULD NOT EQUAL THEM IN THEIR WARMTH. HER SPIRITS SANK UNDER THE
GLOW OF THEIRS, AND SHE FELT HERSELF BECOMING TOO NEARLY NOTHING TO
BOTH TO HAVE ANY COMFORT IN HAVING BEEN SOUGHT BY EITHER. THEY MUST NOW
REHEARSE TOGETHER. EDMUND PROPOSED, URGED, ENTREATED IT, TILL THE LADY,
NOT VERY UNWILLING AT FIRST, COULD REFUSE NO LONGER, AND FANNY WAS
WANTED ONLY TO PROMPT AND OBSERVE THEM. SHE WAS INVESTED, INDEED, WITH
THE OFFICE OF JUDGE AND CRITIC, AND EARNESTLY DESIRED TO EXERCISE IT AND
TELL THEM ALL THEIR FAULTS; BUT FROM DOING SO EVERY FEELING WITHIN HER
SHRANK--SHE COULD NOT, WOULD NOT, DARED NOT ATTEMPT IT: HAD SHE BEEN
OTHERWISE QUALIFIED FOR CRITICISM, HER CONSCIENCE MUST HAVE RESTRAINED
HER FROM VENTURING AT DISAPPROBATION. SHE BELIEVED HERSELF TO FEEL TOO
MUCH OF IT IN THE AGGREGATE FOR HONESTY OR SAFETY IN PARTICULARS. TO
PROMPT THEM MUST BE ENOUGH FOR HER; AND IT WAS SOMETIMES MORE THAN
ENOUGH; FOR SHE COULD NOT ALWAYS PAY ATTENTION TO THE BOOK. IN WATCHING
THEM SHE FORGOT HERSELF; AND, AGITATED BY THE INCREASING SPIRIT OF
EDMUND'S MANNER, HAD ONCE CLOSED THE PAGE AND TURNED AWAY EXACTLY AS HE
WANTED HELP. IT WAS IMPUTED TO VERY REASONABLE WEARINESS, AND SHE WAS
THANKED AND PITIED; BUT SHE DESERVED THEIR PITY MORE THAN SHE HOPED THEY
WOULD EVER SURMISE. AT LAST THE SCENE WAS OVER, AND FANNY FORCED HERSELF
TO ADD HER PRAISE TO THE COMPLIMENTS EACH WAS GIVING THE OTHER; AND WHEN
AGAIN ALONE AND ABLE TO RECALL THE WHOLE, SHE WAS INCLINED TO BELIEVE
THEIR PERFORMANCE WOULD, INDEED, HAVE SUCH NATURE AND FEELING IN IT AS
MUST ENSURE THEIR CREDIT, AND MAKE IT A VERY SUFFERING EXHIBITION TO
HERSELF. WHATEVER MIGHT BE ITS EFFECT, HOWEVER, SHE MUST STAND THE BRUNT
OF IT AGAIN THAT VERY DAY.

THE FIRST REGULAR REHEARSAL OF THE THREE FIRST ACTS WAS CERTAINLY TO
TAKE PLACE IN THE EVENING: MRS. GRANT AND THE CRAWFORDS WERE ENGAGED TO
RETURN FOR THAT PURPOSE AS SOON AS THEY COULD AFTER DINNER; AND EVERY
ONE CONCERNED WAS LOOKING FORWARD WITH EAGERNESS. THERE SEEMED A GENERAL
DIFFUSION OF CHEERFULNESS ON THE OCCASION. TOM WAS ENJOYING SUCH AN
ADVANCE TOWARDS THE END; EDMUND WAS IN SPIRITS FROM THE MORNING'S
REHEARSAL, AND LITTLE VEXATIONS SEEMED EVERYWHERE SMOOTHED AWAY. ALL
WERE ALERT AND IMPATIENT; THE LADIES MOVED SOON, THE GENTLEMEN SOON
FOLLOWED THEM, AND WITH THE EXCEPTION OF LADY BERTRAM, MRS. NORRIS, AND
JULIA, EVERYBODY WAS IN THE THEATRE AT AN EARLY HOUR; AND HAVING LIGHTED
IT UP AS WELL AS ITS UNFINISHED STATE ADMITTED, WERE WAITING ONLY THE
ARRIVAL OF MRS. GRANT AND THE CRAWFORDS TO BEGIN.

THEY DID NOT WAIT LONG FOR THE CRAWFORDS, BUT THERE WAS NO MRS. GRANT.
SHE COULD NOT COME. DR. GRANT, PROFESSING AN INDISPOSITION, FOR WHICH HE
HAD LITTLE CREDIT WITH HIS FAIR SISTER-IN-LAW, COULD NOT SPARE HIS WIFE.

"DR. GRANT IS ILL," SAID SHE, WITH MOCK SOLEMNITY. "HE HAS BEEN ILL EVER
SINCE HE DID NOT EAT ANY OF THE PHEASANT TODAY. HE FANCIED IT TOUGH,
SENT AWAY HIS PLATE, AND HAS BEEN SUFFERING EVER SINCE".

HERE WAS DISAPPOINTMENT! MRS. GRANT'S NON-ATTENDANCE WAS SAD INDEED.
HER PLEASANT MANNERS AND CHEERFUL CONFORMITY MADE HER ALWAYS VALUABLE
AMONGST THEM; BUT NOW SHE WAS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY. THEY COULD NOT
ACT, THEY COULD NOT REHEARSE WITH ANY SATISFACTION WITHOUT HER. THE
COMFORT OF THE WHOLE EVENING WAS DESTROYED. WHAT WAS TO BE DONE? TOM, AS
COTTAGER, WAS IN DESPAIR. AFTER A PAUSE OF PERPLEXITY, SOME EYES BEGAN
TO BE TURNED TOWARDS FANNY, AND A VOICE OR TWO TO SAY, "IF MISS PRICE
WOULD BE SO GOOD AS TO READ THE PART." SHE WAS IMMEDIATELY SURROUNDED
BY SUPPLICATIONS; EVERYBODY ASKED IT; EVEN EDMUND SAID, "DO, FANNY, IF
IT IS NOT VERY DISAGREEABLE TO YOU."

BUT FANNY STILL HUNG BACK. SHE COULD NOT ENDURE THE IDEA OF IT. WHY WAS
NOT MISS CRAWFORD TO BE APPLIED TO AS WELL? OR WHY HAD NOT SHE RATHER
GONE TO HER OWN ROOM, AS SHE HAD FELT TO BE SAFEST, INSTEAD OF ATTENDING
THE REHEARSAL AT ALL? SHE HAD KNOWN IT WOULD IRRITATE AND DISTRESS HER;
SHE HAD KNOWN IT HER DUTY TO KEEP AWAY. SHE WAS PROPERLY PUNISHED.

"YOU HAVE ONLY TO READ THE PART," SAID HENRY CRAWFORD, WITH RENEWED
ENTREATY.

"AND I DO BELIEVE SHE CAN SAY EVERY WORD OF IT," ADDED MARIA, "FOR SHE
COULD PUT MRS. GRANT RIGHT THE OTHER DAY IN TWENTY PLACES. FANNY, I AM
SURE YOU KNOW THE PART."

FANNY COULD NOT SAY SHE DID NOT; AND AS THEY ALL PERSEVERED, AS
EDMUND REPEATED HIS WISH, AND WITH A LOOK OF EVEN FOND DEPENDENCE ON
HER GOOD-NATURE, SHE MUST YIELD. SHE WOULD DO HER BEST. EVERYBODY WAS
SATISFIED; AND SHE WAS LEFT TO THE TREMORS OF A MOST PALPITATING HEART,
WHILE THE OTHERS PREPARED TO BEGIN.

THEY DID BEGIN; AND BEING TOO MUCH ENGAGED IN THEIR OWN NOISE TO BE
STRUCK BY AN UNUSUAL NOISE IN THE OTHER PART OF THE HOUSE, HAD PROCEEDED
SOME WAY WHEN THE DOOR OF THE ROOM WAS THROWN OPEN, AND JULIA, APPEARING
AT IT, WITH A FACE ALL AGHAST, EXCLAIMED, "MY FATHER IS COME! HE IS IN
THE HALL AT THIS MOMENT."



CHAPTER XIX

HOW IS THE CONSTERNATION OF THE PARTY TO BE DESCRIBED? TO THE GREATER
NUMBER IT WAS A MOMENT OF ABSOLUTE HORROR. SIR THOMAS IN THE HOUSE! ALL
FELT THE INSTANTANEOUS CONVICTION. NOT A HOPE OF IMPOSITION OR MISTAKE
WAS HARBOURED ANYWHERE. JULIA'S LOOKS WERE AN EVIDENCE OF THE FACT THAT
MADE IT INDISPUTABLE; AND AFTER THE FIRST STARTS AND EXCLAMATIONS, NOT A
WORD WAS SPOKEN FOR HALF A MINUTE: EACH WITH AN ALTERED COUNTENANCE WAS
LOOKING AT SOME OTHER, AND ALMOST EACH WAS FEELING IT A STROKE THE MOST
UNWELCOME, MOST ILL-TIMED, MOST APPALLING! MR. YATES MIGHT CONSIDER
IT ONLY AS A VEXATIOUS INTERRUPTION FOR THE EVENING, AND MR. RUSHWORTH
MIGHT IMAGINE IT A BLESSING; BUT EVERY OTHER HEART WAS SINKING UNDER
SOME DEGREE OF SELF-CONDEMNATION OR UNDEFINED ALARM, EVERY OTHER HEART
WAS SUGGESTING, "WHAT WILL BECOME OF US? WHAT IS TO BE DONE NOW?" IT
WAS A TERRIBLE PAUSE; AND TERRIBLE TO EVERY EAR WERE THE CORROBORATING
SOUNDS OF OPENING DOORS AND PASSING FOOTSTEPS.

JULIA WAS THE FIRST TO MOVE AND SPEAK AGAIN. JEALOUSY AND BITTERNESS
HAD BEEN SUSPENDED: SELFISHNESS WAS LOST IN THE COMMON CAUSE; BUT AT THE
MOMENT OF HER APPEARANCE, FREDERICK WAS LISTENING WITH LOOKS OF DEVOTION
TO AGATHA'S NARRATIVE, AND PRESSING HER HAND TO HIS HEART; AND AS SOON
AS SHE COULD NOTICE THIS, AND SEE THAT, IN SPITE OF THE SHOCK OF HER
WORDS, HE STILL KEPT HIS STATION AND RETAINED HER SISTER'S HAND, HER
WOUNDED HEART SWELLED AGAIN WITH INJURY, AND LOOKING AS RED AS SHE HAD
BEEN WHITE BEFORE, SHE TURNED OUT OF THE ROOM, SAYING, "I NEED NOT BE
AFRAID OF APPEARING BEFORE HIM."

HER GOING ROUSED THE REST; AND AT THE SAME MOMENT THE TWO BROTHERS
STEPPED FORWARD, FEELING THE NECESSITY OF DOING SOMETHING. A VERY FEW
WORDS BETWEEN THEM WERE SUFFICIENT. THE CASE ADMITTED NO DIFFERENCE OF
OPINION: THEY MUST GO TO THE DRAWING-ROOM DIRECTLY. MARIA JOINED THEM
WITH THE SAME INTENT, JUST THEN THE STOUTEST OF THE THREE; FOR THE
VERY CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH HAD DRIVEN JULIA AWAY WAS TO HER THE SWEETEST
SUPPORT. HENRY CRAWFORD'S RETAINING HER HAND AT SUCH A MOMENT, A MOMENT
OF SUCH PECULIAR PROOF AND IMPORTANCE, WAS WORTH AGES OF DOUBT AND
ANXIETY. SHE HAILED IT AS AN EARNEST OF THE MOST SERIOUS DETERMINATION,
AND WAS EQUAL EVEN TO ENCOUNTER HER FATHER. THEY WALKED OFF, UTTERLY
HEEDLESS OF MR. RUSHWORTH'S REPEATED QUESTION OF, "SHALL I GO TOO? HAD
NOT I BETTER GO TOO? WILL NOT IT BE RIGHT FOR ME TO GO TOO?" BUT THEY
WERE NO SOONER THROUGH THE DOOR THAN HENRY CRAWFORD UNDERTOOK TO ANSWER
THE ANXIOUS INQUIRY, AND, ENCOURAGING HIM BY ALL MEANS TO PAY HIS
RESPECTS TO SIR THOMAS WITHOUT DELAY, SENT HIM AFTER THE OTHERS WITH
DELIGHTED HASTE.

FANNY WAS LEFT WITH ONLY THE CRAWFORDS AND MR. YATES. SHE HAD BEEN QUITE
OVERLOOKED BY HER COUSINS; AND AS HER OWN OPINION OF HER CLAIMS ON SIR
THOMAS'S AFFECTION WAS MUCH TOO HUMBLE TO GIVE HER ANY IDEA OF CLASSING
HERSELF WITH HIS CHILDREN, SHE WAS GLAD TO REMAIN BEHIND AND GAIN A
LITTLE BREATHING-TIME. HER AGITATION AND ALARM EXCEEDED ALL THAT WAS
ENDURED BY THE REST, BY THE RIGHT OF A DISPOSITION WHICH NOT EVEN
INNOCENCE COULD KEEP FROM SUFFERING. SHE WAS NEARLY FAINTING: ALL HER
FORMER HABITUAL DREAD OF HER UNCLE WAS RETURNING, AND WITH IT COMPASSION
FOR HIM AND FOR ALMOST EVERY ONE OF THE PARTY ON THE DEVELOPMENT BEFORE
HIM, WITH SOLICITUDE ON EDMUND'S ACCOUNT INDESCRIBABLE. SHE HAD FOUND
A SEAT, WHERE IN EXCESSIVE TREMBLING SHE WAS ENDURING ALL THESE FEARFUL
THOUGHTS, WHILE THE OTHER THREE, NO LONGER UNDER ANY RESTRAINT, WERE
GIVING VENT TO THEIR FEELINGS OF VEXATION, LAMENTING OVER SUCH AN
UNLOOKED-FOR PREMATURE ARRIVAL AS A MOST UNTOWARD EVENT, AND WITHOUT
MERCY WISHING POOR SIR THOMAS HAD BEEN TWICE AS LONG ON HIS PASSAGE, OR
WERE STILL IN ANTIGUA.

THE CRAWFORDS WERE MORE WARM ON THE SUBJECT THAN MR. YATES, FROM BETTER
UNDERSTANDING THE FAMILY, AND JUDGING MORE CLEARLY OF THE MISCHIEF THAT
MUST ENSUE. THE RUIN OF THE PLAY WAS TO THEM A CERTAINTY: THEY FELT
THE TOTAL DESTRUCTION OF THE SCHEME TO BE INEVITABLY AT HAND; WHILE MR.
YATES CONSIDERED IT ONLY AS A TEMPORARY INTERRUPTION, A DISASTER FOR THE
EVENING, AND COULD EVEN SUGGEST THE POSSIBILITY OF THE REHEARSAL BEING
RENEWED AFTER TEA, WHEN THE BUSTLE OF RECEIVING SIR THOMAS WERE OVER,
AND HE MIGHT BE AT LEISURE TO BE AMUSED BY IT. THE CRAWFORDS LAUGHED
AT THE IDEA; AND HAVING SOON AGREED ON THE PROPRIETY OF THEIR WALKING
QUIETLY HOME AND LEAVING THE FAMILY TO THEMSELVES, PROPOSED MR. YATES'S
ACCOMPANYING THEM AND SPENDING THE EVENING AT THE PARSONAGE. BUT MR.
YATES, HAVING NEVER BEEN WITH THOSE WHO THOUGHT MUCH OF PARENTAL CLAIMS,
OR FAMILY CONFIDENCE, COULD NOT PERCEIVE THAT ANYTHING OF THE KIND WAS
NECESSARY; AND THEREFORE, THANKING THEM, SAID, "HE PREFERRED REMAINING
WHERE HE WAS, THAT HE MIGHT PAY HIS RESPECTS TO THE OLD GENTLEMAN
HANDSOMELY SINCE HE WAS COME; AND BESIDES, HE DID NOT THINK IT WOULD
BE FAIR BY THE OTHERS TO HAVE EVERYBODY RUN AWAY."

FANNY WAS JUST BEGINNING TO COLLECT HERSELF, AND TO FEEL THAT IF SHE
STAID LONGER BEHIND IT MIGHT SEEM DISRESPECTFUL, WHEN THIS POINT WAS
SETTLED, AND BEING COMMISSIONED WITH THE BROTHER AND SISTER'S APOLOGY,
SAW THEM PREPARING TO GO AS SHE QUITTED THE ROOM HERSELF TO PERFORM THE
DREADFUL DUTY OF APPEARING BEFORE HER UNCLE.

TOO SOON DID SHE FIND HERSELF AT THE DRAWING-ROOM DOOR; AND AFTER
PAUSING A MOMENT FOR WHAT SHE KNEW WOULD NOT COME, FOR A COURAGE WHICH
THE OUTSIDE OF NO DOOR HAD EVER SUPPLIED TO HER, SHE TURNED THE LOCK IN
DESPERATION, AND THE LIGHTS OF THE DRAWING-ROOM, AND ALL THE COLLECTED
FAMILY, WERE BEFORE HER. AS SHE ENTERED, HER OWN NAME CAUGHT HER EAR.
SIR THOMAS WAS AT THAT MOMENT LOOKING ROUND HIM, AND SAYING, "BUT WHERE
IS FANNY? WHY DO NOT I SEE MY LITTLE FANNY?"--AND ON PERCEIVING HER,
CAME FORWARD WITH A KINDNESS WHICH ASTONISHED AND PENETRATED HER,
CALLING HER HIS DEAR FANNY, KISSING HER AFFECTIONATELY, AND OBSERVING
WITH DECIDED PLEASURE HOW MUCH SHE WAS GROWN! FANNY KNEW NOT HOW TO
FEEL, NOR WHERE TO LOOK. SHE WAS QUITE OPPRESSED. HE HAD NEVER BEEN SO
KIND, SO VERY KIND TO HER IN HIS LIFE. HIS MANNER SEEMED CHANGED, HIS
VOICE WAS QUICK FROM THE AGITATION OF JOY; AND ALL THAT HAD BEEN AWFUL
IN HIS DIGNITY SEEMED LOST IN TENDERNESS. HE LED HER NEARER THE LIGHT
AND LOOKED AT HER AGAIN--INQUIRED PARTICULARLY AFTER HER HEALTH, AND
THEN, CORRECTING HIMSELF, OBSERVED THAT HE NEED NOT INQUIRE, FOR
HER APPEARANCE SPOKE SUFFICIENTLY ON THAT POINT. A FINE BLUSH HAVING
SUCCEEDED THE PREVIOUS PALENESS OF HER FACE, HE WAS JUSTIFIED IN HIS
BELIEF OF HER EQUAL IMPROVEMENT IN HEALTH AND BEAUTY. HE INQUIRED NEXT
AFTER HER FAMILY, ESPECIALLY WILLIAM: AND HIS KINDNESS ALTOGETHER WAS
SUCH AS MADE HER REPROACH HERSELF FOR LOVING HIM SO LITTLE, AND THINKING
HIS RETURN A MISFORTUNE; AND WHEN, ON HAVING COURAGE TO LIFT HER EYES TO
HIS FACE, SHE SAW THAT HE WAS GROWN THINNER, AND HAD THE BURNT, FAGGED,
WORN LOOK OF FATIGUE AND A HOT CLIMATE, EVERY TENDER FEELING WAS
INCREASED, AND SHE WAS MISERABLE IN CONSIDERING HOW MUCH UNSUSPECTED
VEXATION WAS PROBABLY READY TO BURST ON HIM.

SIR THOMAS WAS INDEED THE LIFE OF THE PARTY, WHO AT HIS SUGGESTION
NOW SEATED THEMSELVES ROUND THE FIRE. HE HAD THE BEST RIGHT TO BE THE
TALKER; AND THE DELIGHT OF HIS SENSATIONS IN BEING AGAIN IN HIS OWN
HOUSE, IN THE CENTRE OF HIS FAMILY, AFTER SUCH A SEPARATION, MADE HIM
COMMUNICATIVE AND CHATTY IN A VERY UNUSUAL DEGREE; AND HE WAS READY TO
GIVE EVERY INFORMATION AS TO HIS VOYAGE, AND ANSWER EVERY QUESTION
OF HIS TWO SONS ALMOST BEFORE IT WAS PUT. HIS BUSINESS IN ANTIGUA HAD
LATTERLY BEEN PROSPEROUSLY RAPID, AND HE CAME DIRECTLY FROM LIVERPOOL,
HAVING HAD AN OPPORTUNITY OF MAKING HIS PASSAGE THITHER IN A PRIVATE
VESSEL, INSTEAD OF WAITING FOR THE PACKET; AND ALL THE LITTLE
PARTICULARS OF HIS PROCEEDINGS AND EVENTS, HIS ARRIVALS AND DEPARTURES,
WERE MOST PROMPTLY DELIVERED, AS HE SAT BY LADY BERTRAM AND LOOKED WITH
HEARTFELT SATISFACTION ON THE FACES AROUND HIM--INTERRUPTING HIMSELF
MORE THAN ONCE, HOWEVER, TO REMARK ON HIS GOOD FORTUNE IN FINDING THEM
ALL AT HOME--COMING UNEXPECTEDLY AS HE DID--ALL COLLECTED TOGETHER
EXACTLY AS HE COULD HAVE WISHED, BUT DARED NOT DEPEND ON. MR. RUSHWORTH
WAS NOT FORGOTTEN: A MOST FRIENDLY RECEPTION AND WARMTH OF HAND-SHAKING
HAD ALREADY MET HIM, AND WITH POINTED ATTENTION HE WAS NOW INCLUDED IN
THE OBJECTS MOST INTIMATELY CONNECTED WITH MANSFIELD. THERE WAS NOTHING
DISAGREEABLE IN MR. RUSHWORTH'S APPEARANCE, AND SIR THOMAS WAS LIKING
HIM ALREADY.

BY NOT ONE OF THE CIRCLE WAS HE LISTENED TO WITH SUCH UNBROKEN,
UNALLOYED ENJOYMENT AS BY HIS WIFE, WHO WAS REALLY EXTREMELY HAPPY TO
SEE HIM, AND WHOSE FEELINGS WERE SO WARMED BY HIS SUDDEN ARRIVAL AS TO
PLACE HER NEARER AGITATION THAN SHE HAD BEEN FOR THE LAST TWENTY YEARS.
SHE HAD BEEN ALMOST FLUTTERED FOR A FEW MINUTES, AND STILL REMAINED SO
SENSIBLY ANIMATED AS TO PUT AWAY HER WORK, MOVE PUG FROM HER SIDE, AND
GIVE ALL HER ATTENTION AND ALL THE REST OF HER SOFA TO HER HUSBAND. SHE
HAD NO ANXIETIES FOR ANYBODY TO CLOUD HER PLEASURE: HER OWN TIME HAD
BEEN IRREPROACHABLY SPENT DURING HIS ABSENCE: SHE HAD DONE A GREAT
DEAL OF CARPET-WORK, AND MADE MANY YARDS OF FRINGE; AND SHE WOULD HAVE
ANSWERED AS FREELY FOR THE GOOD CONDUCT AND USEFUL PURSUITS OF ALL
THE YOUNG PEOPLE AS FOR HER OWN. IT WAS SO AGREEABLE TO HER TO SEE
HIM AGAIN, AND HEAR HIM TALK, TO HAVE HER EAR AMUSED AND HER WHOLE
COMPREHENSION FILLED BY HIS NARRATIVES, THAT SHE BEGAN PARTICULARLY
TO FEEL HOW DREADFULLY SHE MUST HAVE MISSED HIM, AND HOW IMPOSSIBLE IT
WOULD HAVE BEEN FOR HER TO BEAR A LENGTHENED ABSENCE.

MRS. NORRIS WAS BY NO MEANS TO BE COMPARED IN HAPPINESS TO HER
SISTER. NOT THAT SHE WAS INCOMMODED BY MANY FEARS OF SIR THOMAS'S
DISAPPROBATION WHEN THE PRESENT STATE OF HIS HOUSE SHOULD BE KNOWN, FOR
HER JUDGMENT HAD BEEN SO BLINDED THAT, EXCEPT BY THE INSTINCTIVE CAUTION
WITH WHICH SHE HAD WHISKED AWAY MR. RUSHWORTH'S PINK SATIN CLOAK AS HER
BROTHER-IN-LAW ENTERED, SHE COULD HARDLY BE SAID TO SHEW ANY SIGN OF
ALARM; BUT SHE WAS VEXED BY THE MANNER OF HIS RETURN. IT HAD LEFT HER
NOTHING TO DO. INSTEAD OF BEING SENT FOR OUT OF THE ROOM, AND SEEING
HIM FIRST, AND HAVING TO SPREAD THE HAPPY NEWS THROUGH THE HOUSE, SIR
THOMAS, WITH A VERY REASONABLE DEPENDENCE, PERHAPS, ON THE NERVES OF HIS
WIFE AND CHILDREN, HAD SOUGHT NO CONFIDANT BUT THE BUTLER, AND HAD BEEN
FOLLOWING HIM ALMOST INSTANTANEOUSLY INTO THE DRAWING-ROOM. MRS. NORRIS
FELT HERSELF DEFRAUDED OF AN OFFICE ON WHICH SHE HAD ALWAYS DEPENDED,
WHETHER HIS ARRIVAL OR HIS DEATH WERE TO BE THE THING UNFOLDED; AND WAS
NOW TRYING TO BE IN A BUSTLE WITHOUT HAVING ANYTHING TO BUSTLE ABOUT,
AND LABOURING TO BE IMPORTANT WHERE NOTHING WAS WANTED BUT TRANQUILLITY
AND SILENCE. WOULD SIR THOMAS HAVE CONSENTED TO EAT, SHE MIGHT HAVE GONE
TO THE HOUSEKEEPER WITH TROUBLESOME DIRECTIONS, AND INSULTED THE FOOTMEN
WITH INJUNCTIONS OF DESPATCH; BUT SIR THOMAS RESOLUTELY DECLINED ALL
DINNER: HE WOULD TAKE NOTHING, NOTHING TILL TEA CAME--HE WOULD RATHER
WAIT FOR TEA. STILL MRS. NORRIS WAS AT INTERVALS URGING SOMETHING
DIFFERENT; AND IN THE MOST INTERESTING MOMENT OF HIS PASSAGE TO ENGLAND,
WHEN THE ALARM OF A FRENCH PRIVATEER WAS AT THE HEIGHT, SHE BURST
THROUGH HIS RECITAL WITH THE PROPOSAL OF SOUP. "SURE, MY DEAR SIR
THOMAS, A BASIN OF SOUP WOULD BE A MUCH BETTER THING FOR YOU THAN TEA.
DO HAVE A BASIN OF SOUP."

SIR THOMAS COULD NOT BE PROVOKED. "STILL THE SAME ANXIETY FOR
EVERYBODY'S COMFORT, MY DEAR MRS. NORRIS," WAS HIS ANSWER. "BUT INDEED I
WOULD RATHER HAVE NOTHING BUT TEA."

"WELL, THEN, LADY BERTRAM, SUPPOSE YOU SPEAK FOR TEA DIRECTLY; SUPPOSE
YOU HURRY BADDELEY A LITTLE; HE SEEMS BEHINDHAND TO-NIGHT." SHE CARRIED
THIS POINT, AND SIR THOMAS'S NARRATIVE PROCEEDED.

AT LENGTH THERE WAS A PAUSE. HIS IMMEDIATE COMMUNICATIONS WERE
EXHAUSTED, AND IT SEEMED ENOUGH TO BE LOOKING JOYFULLY AROUND HIM, NOW
AT ONE, NOW AT ANOTHER OF THE BELOVED CIRCLE; BUT THE PAUSE WAS NOT
LONG: IN THE ELATION OF HER SPIRITS LADY BERTRAM BECAME TALKATIVE, AND
WHAT WERE THE SENSATIONS OF HER CHILDREN UPON HEARING HER SAY, "HOW
DO YOU THINK THE YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE BEEN AMUSING THEMSELVES LATELY, SIR
THOMAS? THEY HAVE BEEN ACTING. WE HAVE BEEN ALL ALIVE WITH ACTING."

"INDEED! AND WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN ACTING?"

"OH! THEY'LL TELL YOU ALL ABOUT IT."

"THE ALL WILL SOON BE TOLD," CRIED TOM HASTILY, AND WITH AFFECTED
UNCONCERN; "BUT IT IS NOT WORTH WHILE TO BORE MY FATHER WITH IT NOW. YOU
WILL HEAR ENOUGH OF IT TO-MORROW, SIR. WE HAVE JUST BEEN TRYING, BY WAY
OF DOING SOMETHING, AND AMUSING MY MOTHER, JUST WITHIN THE LAST WEEK,
TO GET UP A FEW SCENES, A MERE TRIFLE. WE HAVE HAD SUCH INCESSANT RAINS
ALMOST SINCE OCTOBER BEGAN, THAT WE HAVE BEEN NEARLY CONFINED TO THE
HOUSE FOR DAYS TOGETHER. I HAVE HARDLY TAKEN OUT A GUN SINCE THE 3RD.
TOLERABLE SPORT THE FIRST THREE DAYS, BUT THERE HAS BEEN NO ATTEMPTING
ANYTHING SINCE. THE FIRST DAY I WENT OVER MANSFIELD WOOD, AND EDMUND
TOOK THE COPSES BEYOND EASTON, AND WE BROUGHT HOME SIX BRACE BETWEEN
US, AND MIGHT EACH HAVE KILLED SIX TIMES AS MANY, BUT WE RESPECT YOUR
PHEASANTS, SIR, I ASSURE YOU, AS MUCH AS YOU COULD DESIRE. I DO NOT
THINK YOU WILL FIND YOUR WOODS BY ANY MEANS WORSE STOCKED THAN THEY
WERE. I NEVER SAW MANSFIELD WOOD SO FULL OF PHEASANTS IN MY LIFE
AS THIS YEAR. I HOPE YOU WILL TAKE A DAY'S SPORT THERE YOURSELF, SIR,
SOON."

FOR THE PRESENT THE DANGER WAS OVER, AND FANNY'S SICK FEELINGS SUBSIDED;
BUT WHEN TEA WAS SOON AFTERWARDS BROUGHT IN, AND SIR THOMAS, GETTING UP,
SAID THAT HE FOUND THAT HE COULD NOT BE ANY LONGER IN THE HOUSE WITHOUT
JUST LOOKING INTO HIS OWN DEAR ROOM, EVERY AGITATION WAS RETURNING. HE
WAS GONE BEFORE ANYTHING HAD BEEN SAID TO PREPARE HIM FOR THE CHANGE HE
MUST FIND THERE; AND A PAUSE OF ALARM FOLLOWED HIS DISAPPEARANCE. EDMUND
WAS THE FIRST TO SPEAK--

"SOMETHING MUST BE DONE," SAID HE.

"IT IS TIME TO THINK OF OUR VISITORS," SAID MARIA, STILL FEELING HER
HAND PRESSED TO HENRY CRAWFORD'S HEART, AND CARING LITTLE FOR ANYTHING
ELSE. "WHERE DID YOU LEAVE MISS CRAWFORD, FANNY?"

FANNY TOLD OF THEIR DEPARTURE, AND DELIVERED THEIR MESSAGE.

"THEN POOR YATES IS ALL ALONE," CRIED TOM. "I WILL GO AND FETCH HIM. HE
WILL BE NO BAD ASSISTANT WHEN IT ALL COMES OUT."

TO THE THEATRE HE WENT, AND REACHED IT JUST IN TIME TO WITNESS THE FIRST
MEETING OF HIS FATHER AND HIS FRIEND. SIR THOMAS HAD BEEN A GOOD DEAL
SURPRISED TO FIND CANDLES BURNING IN HIS ROOM; AND ON CASTING HIS EYE
ROUND IT, TO SEE OTHER SYMPTOMS OF RECENT HABITATION AND A GENERAL AIR
OF CONFUSION IN THE FURNITURE. THE REMOVAL OF THE BOOKCASE FROM BEFORE
THE BILLIARD-ROOM DOOR STRUCK HIM ESPECIALLY, BUT HE HAD SCARCELY MORE
THAN TIME TO FEEL ASTONISHED AT ALL THIS, BEFORE THERE WERE SOUNDS FROM
THE BILLIARD-ROOM TO ASTONISH HIM STILL FARTHER. SOME ONE WAS TALKING
THERE IN A VERY LOUD ACCENT; HE DID NOT KNOW THE VOICE--MORE THAN
TALKING--ALMOST HALLOOING. HE STEPPED TO THE DOOR, REJOICING AT THAT
MOMENT IN HAVING THE MEANS OF IMMEDIATE COMMUNICATION, AND, OPENING IT,
FOUND HIMSELF ON THE STAGE OF A THEATRE, AND OPPOSED TO A RANTING YOUNG
MAN, WHO APPEARED LIKELY TO KNOCK HIM DOWN BACKWARDS. AT THE VERY MOMENT
OF YATES PERCEIVING SIR THOMAS, AND GIVING PERHAPS THE VERY BEST START
HE HAD EVER GIVEN IN THE WHOLE COURSE OF HIS REHEARSALS, TOM BERTRAM
ENTERED AT THE OTHER END OF THE ROOM; AND NEVER HAD HE FOUND GREATER
DIFFICULTY IN KEEPING HIS COUNTENANCE. HIS FATHER'S LOOKS OF SOLEMNITY
AND AMAZEMENT ON THIS HIS FIRST APPEARANCE ON ANY STAGE, AND THE GRADUAL
METAMORPHOSIS OF THE IMPASSIONED BARON WILDENHEIM INTO THE WELL-BRED AND
EASY MR. YATES, MAKING HIS BOW AND APOLOGY TO SIR THOMAS BERTRAM, WAS
SUCH AN EXHIBITION, SUCH A PIECE OF TRUE ACTING, AS HE WOULD NOT HAVE
LOST UPON ANY ACCOUNT. IT WOULD BE THE LAST--IN ALL PROBABILITY--THE
LAST SCENE ON THAT STAGE; BUT HE WAS SURE THERE COULD NOT BE A FINER.
THE HOUSE WOULD CLOSE WITH THE GREATEST ECLAT.

THERE WAS LITTLE TIME, HOWEVER, FOR THE INDULGENCE OF ANY IMAGES OF
MERRIMENT. IT WAS NECESSARY FOR HIM TO STEP FORWARD, TOO, AND ASSIST
THE INTRODUCTION, AND WITH MANY AWKWARD SENSATIONS HE DID HIS BEST. SIR
THOMAS RECEIVED MR. YATES WITH ALL THE APPEARANCE OF CORDIALITY WHICH
WAS DUE TO HIS OWN CHARACTER, BUT WAS REALLY AS FAR FROM PLEASED
WITH THE NECESSITY OF THE ACQUAINTANCE AS WITH THE MANNER OF ITS
COMMENCEMENT. MR. YATES'S FAMILY AND CONNEXIONS WERE SUFFICIENTLY KNOWN
TO HIM TO RENDER HIS INTRODUCTION AS THE "PARTICULAR FRIEND," ANOTHER OF
THE HUNDRED PARTICULAR FRIENDS OF HIS SON, EXCEEDINGLY UNWELCOME; AND IT
NEEDED ALL THE FELICITY OF BEING AGAIN AT HOME, AND ALL THE FORBEARANCE
IT COULD SUPPLY, TO SAVE SIR THOMAS FROM ANGER ON FINDING HIMSELF THUS
BEWILDERED IN HIS OWN HOUSE, MAKING PART OF A RIDICULOUS EXHIBITION IN
THE MIDST OF THEATRICAL NONSENSE, AND FORCED IN SO UNTOWARD A MOMENT TO
ADMIT THE ACQUAINTANCE OF A YOUNG MAN WHOM HE FELT SURE OF DISAPPROVING,
AND WHOSE EASY INDIFFERENCE AND VOLUBILITY IN THE COURSE OF THE FIRST
FIVE MINUTES SEEMED TO MARK HIM THE MOST AT HOME OF THE TWO.

TOM UNDERSTOOD HIS FATHER'S THOUGHTS, AND HEARTILY WISHING HE MIGHT BE
ALWAYS AS WELL DISPOSED TO GIVE THEM BUT PARTIAL EXPRESSION, BEGAN TO
SEE, MORE CLEARLY THAN HE HAD EVER DONE BEFORE, THAT THERE MIGHT BE SOME
GROUND OF OFFENCE, THAT THERE MIGHT BE SOME REASON FOR THE GLANCE HIS
FATHER GAVE TOWARDS THE CEILING AND STUCCO OF THE ROOM; AND THAT WHEN HE
INQUIRED WITH MILD GRAVITY AFTER THE FATE OF THE BILLIARD-TABLE, HE WAS
NOT PROCEEDING BEYOND A VERY ALLOWABLE CURIOSITY. A FEW MINUTES WERE
ENOUGH FOR SUCH UNSATISFACTORY SENSATIONS ON EACH SIDE; AND SIR
THOMAS HAVING EXERTED HIMSELF SO FAR AS TO SPEAK A FEW WORDS OF
CALM APPROBATION IN REPLY TO AN EAGER APPEAL OF MR. YATES, AS TO THE
HAPPINESS OF THE ARRANGEMENT, THE THREE GENTLEMEN RETURNED TO THE
DRAWING-ROOM TOGETHER, SIR THOMAS WITH AN INCREASE OF GRAVITY WHICH WAS
NOT LOST ON ALL.

"I COME FROM YOUR THEATRE," SAID HE COMPOSEDLY, AS HE SAT DOWN; "I FOUND
MYSELF IN IT RATHER UNEXPECTEDLY. ITS VICINITY TO MY OWN ROOM--BUT IN
EVERY RESPECT, INDEED, IT TOOK ME BY SURPRISE, AS I HAD NOT THE SMALLEST
SUSPICION OF YOUR ACTING HAVING ASSUMED SO SERIOUS A CHARACTER. IT
APPEARS A NEAT JOB, HOWEVER, AS FAR AS I COULD JUDGE BY CANDLELIGHT,
AND DOES MY FRIEND CHRISTOPHER JACKSON CREDIT." AND THEN HE WOULD
HAVE CHANGED THE SUBJECT, AND SIPPED HIS COFFEE IN PEACE OVER DOMESTIC
MATTERS OF A CALMER HUE; BUT MR. YATES, WITHOUT DISCERNMENT TO CATCH SIR
THOMAS'S MEANING, OR DIFFIDENCE, OR DELICACY, OR DISCRETION ENOUGH TO
ALLOW HIM TO LEAD THE DISCOURSE WHILE HE MINGLED AMONG THE OTHERS WITH
THE LEAST OBTRUSIVENESS HIMSELF, WOULD KEEP HIM ON THE TOPIC OF THE
THEATRE, WOULD TORMENT HIM WITH QUESTIONS AND REMARKS RELATIVE TO IT,
AND FINALLY WOULD MAKE HIM HEAR THE WHOLE HISTORY OF HIS DISAPPOINTMENT
AT ECCLESFORD. SIR THOMAS LISTENED MOST POLITELY, BUT FOUND MUCH TO
OFFEND HIS IDEAS OF DECORUM, AND CONFIRM HIS ILL-OPINION OF MR. YATES'S
HABITS OF THINKING, FROM THE BEGINNING TO THE END OF THE STORY; AND WHEN
IT WAS OVER, COULD GIVE HIM NO OTHER ASSURANCE OF SYMPATHY THAN WHAT A
SLIGHT BOW CONVEYED.

"THIS WAS, IN FACT, THE ORIGIN OF OUR ACTING," SAID TOM, AFTER
A MOMENT'S THOUGHT. "MY FRIEND YATES BROUGHT THE INFECTION FROM
ECCLESFORD, AND IT SPREAD--AS THOSE THINGS ALWAYS SPREAD, YOU KNOW,
SIR--THE FASTER, PROBABLY, FROM YOUR HAVING SO OFTEN ENCOURAGED THE
SORT OF THING IN US FORMERLY. IT WAS LIKE TREADING OLD GROUND AGAIN."

MR. YATES TOOK THE SUBJECT FROM HIS FRIEND AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, AND
IMMEDIATELY GAVE SIR THOMAS AN ACCOUNT OF WHAT THEY HAD DONE AND WERE
DOING: TOLD HIM OF THE GRADUAL INCREASE OF THEIR VIEWS, THE HAPPY
CONCLUSION OF THEIR FIRST DIFFICULTIES, AND PRESENT PROMISING STATE OF
AFFAIRS; RELATING EVERYTHING WITH SO BLIND AN INTEREST AS MADE HIM NOT
ONLY TOTALLY UNCONSCIOUS OF THE UNEASY MOVEMENTS OF MANY OF HIS
FRIENDS AS THEY SAT, THE CHANGE OF COUNTENANCE, THE FIDGET, THE HEM! OF
UNQUIETNESS, BUT PREVENTED HIM EVEN FROM SEEING THE EXPRESSION OF THE
FACE ON WHICH HIS OWN EYES WERE FIXED--FROM SEEING SIR THOMAS'S DARK
BROW CONTRACT AS HE LOOKED WITH INQUIRING EARNESTNESS AT HIS DAUGHTERS
AND EDMUND, DWELLING PARTICULARLY ON THE LATTER, AND SPEAKING A
LANGUAGE, A REMONSTRANCE, A REPROOF, WHICH HE FELT AT HIS HEART. NOT
LESS ACUTELY WAS IT FELT BY FANNY, WHO HAD EDGED BACK HER CHAIR BEHIND
HER AUNT'S END OF THE SOFA, AND, SCREENED FROM NOTICE HERSELF, SAW ALL
THAT WAS PASSING BEFORE HER. SUCH A LOOK OF REPROACH AT EDMUND FROM HIS
FATHER SHE COULD NEVER HAVE EXPECTED TO WITNESS; AND TO FEEL THAT IT
WAS IN ANY DEGREE DESERVED WAS AN AGGRAVATION INDEED. SIR THOMAS'S
LOOK IMPLIED, "ON YOUR JUDGMENT, EDMUND, I DEPENDED; WHAT HAVE YOU
BEEN ABOUT?" SHE KNELT IN SPIRIT TO HER UNCLE, AND HER BOSOM SWELLED TO
UTTER, "OH, NOT TO HIM! LOOK SO TO ALL THE OTHERS, BUT NOT TO HIM!"

MR. YATES WAS STILL TALKING. "TO OWN THE TRUTH, SIR THOMAS, WE WERE IN
THE MIDDLE OF A REHEARSAL WHEN YOU ARRIVED THIS EVENING. WE WERE GOING
THROUGH THE THREE FIRST ACTS, AND NOT UNSUCCESSFULLY UPON THE WHOLE. OUR
COMPANY IS NOW SO DISPERSED, FROM THE CRAWFORDS BEING GONE HOME, THAT
NOTHING MORE CAN BE DONE TO-NIGHT; BUT IF YOU WILL GIVE US THE HONOUR OF
YOUR COMPANY TO-MORROW EVENING, I SHOULD NOT BE AFRAID OF THE RESULT. WE
BESPEAK YOUR INDULGENCE, YOU UNDERSTAND, AS YOUNG PERFORMERS; WE BESPEAK
YOUR INDULGENCE."

"MY INDULGENCE SHALL BE GIVEN, SIR," REPLIED SIR THOMAS GRAVELY, "BUT
WITHOUT ANY OTHER REHEARSAL." AND WITH A RELENTING SMILE, HE ADDED, "I
COME HOME TO BE HAPPY AND INDULGENT." THEN TURNING AWAY TOWARDS ANY
OR ALL OF THE REST, HE TRANQUILLY SAID, "MR. AND MISS CRAWFORD WERE
MENTIONED IN MY LAST LETTERS FROM MANSFIELD. DO YOU FIND THEM AGREEABLE
ACQUAINTANCE?"

TOM WAS THE ONLY ONE AT ALL READY WITH AN ANSWER, BUT HE BEING ENTIRELY
WITHOUT PARTICULAR REGARD FOR EITHER, WITHOUT JEALOUSY EITHER IN LOVE
OR ACTING, COULD SPEAK VERY HANDSOMELY OF BOTH. "MR. CRAWFORD WAS A
MOST PLEASANT, GENTLEMAN-LIKE MAN; HIS SISTER A SWEET, PRETTY, ELEGANT,
LIVELY GIRL."

MR. RUSHWORTH COULD BE SILENT NO LONGER. "I DO NOT SAY HE IS NOT
GENTLEMAN-LIKE, CONSIDERING; BUT YOU SHOULD TELL YOUR FATHER HE IS NOT
ABOVE FIVE FEET EIGHT, OR HE WILL BE EXPECTING A WELL-LOOKING MAN."

SIR THOMAS DID NOT QUITE UNDERSTAND THIS, AND LOOKED WITH SOME SURPRISE
AT THE SPEAKER.

"IF I MUST SAY WHAT I THINK," CONTINUED MR. RUSHWORTH, "IN MY OPINION IT
IS VERY DISAGREEABLE TO BE ALWAYS REHEARSING. IT IS HAVING TOO MUCH OF A
GOOD THING. I AM NOT SO FOND OF ACTING AS I WAS AT FIRST. I THINK WE ARE
A GREAT DEAL BETTER EMPLOYED, SITTING COMFORTABLY HERE AMONG OURSELVES,
AND DOING NOTHING."

SIR THOMAS LOOKED AGAIN, AND THEN REPLIED WITH AN APPROVING SMILE, "I AM
HAPPY TO FIND OUR SENTIMENTS ON THIS SUBJECT SO MUCH THE SAME. IT GIVES
ME SINCERE SATISFACTION. THAT I SHOULD BE CAUTIOUS AND QUICK-SIGHTED,
AND FEEL MANY SCRUPLES WHICH MY CHILDREN DO NOT FEEL, IS PERFECTLY
NATURAL; AND EQUALLY SO THAT MY VALUE FOR DOMESTIC TRANQUILLITY, FOR A
HOME WHICH SHUTS OUT NOISY PLEASURES, SHOULD MUCH EXCEED THEIRS. BUT AT
YOUR TIME OF LIFE TO FEEL ALL THIS, IS A MOST FAVOURABLE CIRCUMSTANCE
FOR YOURSELF, AND FOR EVERYBODY CONNECTED WITH YOU; AND I AM SENSIBLE OF
THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING AN ALLY OF SUCH WEIGHT."

SIR THOMAS MEANT TO BE GIVING MR. RUSHWORTH'S OPINION IN BETTER WORDS
THAN HE COULD FIND HIMSELF. HE WAS AWARE THAT HE MUST NOT EXPECT A
GENIUS IN MR. RUSHWORTH; BUT AS A WELL-JUDGING, STEADY YOUNG MAN, WITH
BETTER NOTIONS THAN HIS ELOCUTION WOULD DO JUSTICE TO, HE INTENDED TO
VALUE HIM VERY HIGHLY. IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR MANY OF THE OTHERS NOT TO
SMILE. MR. RUSHWORTH HARDLY KNEW WHAT TO DO WITH SO MUCH MEANING; BUT BY
LOOKING, AS HE REALLY FELT, MOST EXCEEDINGLY PLEASED WITH SIR THOMAS'S
GOOD OPINION, AND SAYING SCARCELY ANYTHING, HE DID HIS BEST TOWARDS
PRESERVING THAT GOOD OPINION A LITTLE LONGER.



CHAPTER XX

EDMUND'S FIRST OBJECT THE NEXT MORNING WAS TO SEE HIS FATHER ALONE, AND
GIVE HIM A FAIR STATEMENT OF THE WHOLE ACTING SCHEME, DEFENDING HIS OWN
SHARE IN IT AS FAR ONLY AS HE COULD THEN, IN A SOBERER MOMENT, FEEL HIS
MOTIVES TO DESERVE, AND ACKNOWLEDGING, WITH PERFECT INGENUOUSNESS, THAT
HIS CONCESSION HAD BEEN ATTENDED WITH SUCH PARTIAL GOOD AS TO MAKE HIS
JUDGMENT IN IT VERY DOUBTFUL. HE WAS ANXIOUS, WHILE VINDICATING HIMSELF,
TO SAY NOTHING UNKIND OF THE OTHERS: BUT THERE WAS ONLY ONE AMONGST
THEM WHOSE CONDUCT HE COULD MENTION WITHOUT SOME NECESSITY OF DEFENCE
OR PALLIATION. "WE HAVE ALL BEEN MORE OR LESS TO BLAME," SAID HE, "EVERY
ONE OF US, EXCEPTING FANNY. FANNY IS THE ONLY ONE WHO HAS JUDGED RIGHTLY
THROUGHOUT; WHO HAS BEEN CONSISTENT. HER FEELINGS HAVE BEEN STEADILY
AGAINST IT FROM FIRST TO LAST. SHE NEVER CEASED TO THINK OF WHAT WAS DUE
TO YOU. YOU WILL FIND FANNY EVERYTHING YOU COULD WISH."

SIR THOMAS SAW ALL THE IMPROPRIETY OF SUCH A SCHEME AMONG SUCH A PARTY,
AND AT SUCH A TIME, AS STRONGLY AS HIS SON HAD EVER SUPPOSED HE MUST; HE
FELT IT TOO MUCH, INDEED, FOR MANY WORDS; AND HAVING SHAKEN HANDS WITH
EDMUND, MEANT TO TRY TO LOSE THE DISAGREEABLE IMPRESSION, AND FORGET HOW
MUCH HE HAD BEEN FORGOTTEN HIMSELF AS SOON AS HE COULD, AFTER THE HOUSE
HAD BEEN CLEARED OF EVERY OBJECT ENFORCING THE REMEMBRANCE, AND RESTORED
TO ITS PROPER STATE. HE DID NOT ENTER INTO ANY REMONSTRANCE WITH HIS
OTHER CHILDREN: HE WAS MORE WILLING TO BELIEVE THEY FELT THEIR ERROR
THAN TO RUN THE RISK OF INVESTIGATION. THE REPROOF OF AN IMMEDIATE
CONCLUSION OF EVERYTHING, THE SWEEP OF EVERY PREPARATION, WOULD BE
SUFFICIENT.

THERE WAS ONE PERSON, HOWEVER, IN THE HOUSE, WHOM HE COULD NOT LEAVE
TO LEARN HIS SENTIMENTS MERELY THROUGH HIS CONDUCT. HE COULD NOT HELP
GIVING MRS. NORRIS A HINT OF HIS HAVING HOPED THAT HER ADVICE MIGHT
HAVE BEEN INTERPOSED TO PREVENT WHAT HER JUDGMENT MUST CERTAINLY HAVE
DISAPPROVED. THE YOUNG PEOPLE HAD BEEN VERY INCONSIDERATE IN FORMING THE
PLAN; THEY OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN CAPABLE OF A BETTER DECISION THEMSELVES;
BUT THEY WERE YOUNG; AND, EXCEPTING EDMUND, HE BELIEVED, OF UNSTEADY
CHARACTERS; AND WITH GREATER SURPRISE, THEREFORE, HE MUST REGARD HER
ACQUIESCENCE IN THEIR WRONG MEASURES, HER COUNTENANCE OF THEIR UNSAFE
AMUSEMENTS, THAN THAT SUCH MEASURES AND SUCH AMUSEMENTS SHOULD HAVE
BEEN SUGGESTED. MRS. NORRIS WAS A LITTLE CONFOUNDED AND AS NEARLY
BEING SILENCED AS EVER SHE HAD BEEN IN HER LIFE; FOR SHE WAS ASHAMED TO
CONFESS HAVING NEVER SEEN ANY OF THE IMPROPRIETY WHICH WAS SO GLARING
TO SIR THOMAS, AND WOULD NOT HAVE ADMITTED THAT HER INFLUENCE WAS
INSUFFICIENT--THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE TALKED IN VAIN. HER ONLY RESOURCE WAS
TO GET OUT OF THE SUBJECT AS FAST AS POSSIBLE, AND TURN THE CURRENT
OF SIR THOMAS'S IDEAS INTO A HAPPIER CHANNEL. SHE HAD A GREAT DEAL TO
INSINUATE IN HER OWN PRAISE AS TO GENERAL ATTENTION TO THE INTEREST
AND COMFORT OF HIS FAMILY, MUCH EXERTION AND MANY SACRIFICES TO GLANCE
AT IN THE FORM OF HURRIED WALKS AND SUDDEN REMOVALS FROM HER OWN
FIRESIDE, AND MANY EXCELLENT HINTS OF DISTRUST AND ECONOMY TO LADY
BERTRAM AND EDMUND TO DETAIL, WHEREBY A MOST CONSIDERABLE SAVING HAD
ALWAYS ARISEN, AND MORE THAN ONE BAD SERVANT BEEN DETECTED. BUT HER
CHIEF STRENGTH LAY IN SOTHERTON. HER GREATEST SUPPORT AND GLORY WAS
IN HAVING FORMED THE CONNEXION WITH THE RUSHWORTHS. THERE SHE
WAS IMPREGNABLE. SHE TOOK TO HERSELF ALL THE CREDIT OF BRINGING MR.
RUSHWORTH'S ADMIRATION OF MARIA TO ANY EFFECT. "IF I HAD NOT BEEN
ACTIVE," SAID SHE, "AND MADE A POINT OF BEING INTRODUCED TO HIS MOTHER,
AND THEN PREVAILED ON MY SISTER TO PAY THE FIRST VISIT, I AM AS CERTAIN
AS I SIT HERE THAT NOTHING WOULD HAVE COME OF IT; FOR MR. RUSHWORTH
IS THE SORT OF AMIABLE MODEST YOUNG MAN WHO WANTS A GREAT DEAL OF
ENCOURAGEMENT, AND THERE WERE GIRLS ENOUGH ON THE CATCH FOR HIM IF WE
HAD BEEN IDLE. BUT I LEFT NO STONE UNTURNED. I WAS READY TO MOVE HEAVEN
AND EARTH TO PERSUADE MY SISTER, AND AT LAST I DID PERSUADE HER. YOU
KNOW THE DISTANCE TO SOTHERTON; IT WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF WINTER, AND THE
ROADS ALMOST IMPASSABLE, BUT I DID PERSUADE HER."

"I KNOW HOW GREAT, HOW JUSTLY GREAT, YOUR INFLUENCE IS WITH LADY BERTRAM
AND HER CHILDREN, AND AM THE MORE CONCERNED THAT IT SHOULD NOT HAVE
BEEN."

"MY DEAR SIR THOMAS, IF YOU HAD SEEN THE STATE OF THE ROADS THAT DAY!
I THOUGHT WE SHOULD NEVER HAVE GOT THROUGH THEM, THOUGH WE HAD THE FOUR
HORSES OF COURSE; AND POOR OLD COACHMAN WOULD ATTEND US, OUT OF HIS
GREAT LOVE AND KINDNESS, THOUGH HE WAS HARDLY ABLE TO SIT THE BOX ON
ACCOUNT OF THE RHEUMATISM WHICH I HAD BEEN DOCTORING HIM FOR EVER SINCE
MICHAELMAS. I CURED HIM AT LAST; BUT HE WAS VERY BAD ALL THE WINTER--AND
THIS WAS SUCH A DAY, I COULD NOT HELP GOING TO HIM UP IN HIS ROOM BEFORE
WE SET OFF TO ADVISE HIM NOT TO VENTURE: HE WAS PUTTING ON HIS WIG; SO
I SAID, 'COACHMAN, YOU HAD MUCH BETTER NOT GO; YOUR LADY AND I SHALL BE
VERY SAFE; YOU KNOW HOW STEADY STEPHEN IS, AND CHARLES HAS BEEN UPON THE
LEADERS SO OFTEN NOW, THAT I AM SURE THERE IS NO FEAR.' BUT, HOWEVER, I
SOON FOUND IT WOULD NOT DO; HE WAS BENT UPON GOING, AND AS I HATE TO BE
WORRYING AND OFFICIOUS, I SAID NO MORE; BUT MY HEART QUITE ACHED FOR HIM
AT EVERY JOLT, AND WHEN WE GOT INTO THE ROUGH LANES ABOUT STOKE, WHERE,
WHAT WITH FROST AND SNOW UPON BEDS OF STONES, IT WAS WORSE THAN ANYTHING
YOU CAN IMAGINE, I WAS QUITE IN AN AGONY ABOUT HIM. AND THEN THE POOR
HORSES TOO! TO SEE THEM STRAINING AWAY! YOU KNOW HOW I ALWAYS FEEL FOR
THE HORSES. AND WHEN WE GOT TO THE BOTTOM OF SANDCROFT HILL, WHAT DO YOU
THINK I DID? YOU WILL LAUGH AT ME; BUT I GOT OUT AND WALKED UP. I DID
INDEED. IT MIGHT NOT BE SAVING THEM MUCH, BUT IT WAS SOMETHING, AND I
COULD NOT BEAR TO SIT AT MY EASE AND BE DRAGGED UP AT THE EXPENSE OF
THOSE NOBLE ANIMALS. I CAUGHT A DREADFUL COLD, BUT THAT I DID NOT
REGARD. MY OBJECT WAS ACCOMPLISHED IN THE VISIT."

"I HOPE WE SHALL ALWAYS THINK THE ACQUAINTANCE WORTH ANY TROUBLE THAT
MIGHT BE TAKEN TO ESTABLISH IT. THERE IS NOTHING VERY STRIKING IN MR.
RUSHWORTH'S MANNERS, BUT I WAS PLEASED LAST NIGHT WITH WHAT APPEARED TO
BE HIS OPINION ON ONE SUBJECT: HIS DECIDED PREFERENCE OF A QUIET FAMILY
PARTY TO THE BUSTLE AND CONFUSION OF ACTING. HE SEEMED TO FEEL EXACTLY
AS ONE COULD WISH."

"YES, INDEED, AND THE MORE YOU KNOW OF HIM THE BETTER YOU WILL LIKE HIM.
HE IS NOT A SHINING CHARACTER, BUT HE HAS A THOUSAND GOOD QUALITIES; AND
IS SO DISPOSED TO LOOK UP TO YOU, THAT I AM QUITE LAUGHED AT ABOUT IT,
FOR EVERYBODY CONSIDERS IT AS MY DOING. 'UPON MY WORD, MRS. NORRIS,'
SAID MRS. GRANT THE OTHER DAY, 'IF MR. RUSHWORTH WERE A SON OF YOUR OWN,
HE COULD NOT HOLD SIR THOMAS IN GREATER RESPECT.'"

SIR THOMAS GAVE UP THE POINT, FOILED BY HER EVASIONS, DISARMED BY HER
FLATTERY; AND WAS OBLIGED TO REST SATISFIED WITH THE CONVICTION THAT
WHERE THE PRESENT PLEASURE OF THOSE SHE LOVED WAS AT STAKE, HER KINDNESS
DID SOMETIMES OVERPOWER HER JUDGMENT.

IT WAS A BUSY MORNING WITH HIM. CONVERSATION WITH ANY OF THEM OCCUPIED
BUT A SMALL PART OF IT. HE HAD TO REINSTATE HIMSELF IN ALL THE WONTED
CONCERNS OF HIS MANSFIELD LIFE: TO SEE HIS STEWARD AND HIS BAILIFF; TO
EXAMINE AND COMPUTE, AND, IN THE INTERVALS OF BUSINESS, TO WALK INTO
HIS STABLES AND HIS GARDENS, AND NEAREST PLANTATIONS; BUT ACTIVE AND
METHODICAL, HE HAD NOT ONLY DONE ALL THIS BEFORE HE RESUMED HIS SEAT AS
MASTER OF THE HOUSE AT DINNER, HE HAD ALSO SET THE CARPENTER TO WORK IN
PULLING DOWN WHAT HAD BEEN SO LATELY PUT UP IN THE BILLIARD-ROOM,
AND GIVEN THE SCENE-PAINTER HIS DISMISSAL LONG ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY THE
PLEASING BELIEF OF HIS BEING THEN AT LEAST AS FAR OFF AS NORTHAMPTON.
THE SCENE-PAINTER WAS GONE, HAVING SPOILT ONLY THE FLOOR OF ONE ROOM,
RUINED ALL THE COACHMAN'S SPONGES, AND MADE FIVE OF THE UNDER-SERVANTS
IDLE AND DISSATISFIED; AND SIR THOMAS WAS IN HOPES THAT ANOTHER DAY OR
TWO WOULD SUFFICE TO WIPE AWAY EVERY OUTWARD MEMENTO OF WHAT HAD BEEN,
EVEN TO THE DESTRUCTION OF EVERY UNBOUND COPY OF LOVERS' VOWS IN THE
HOUSE, FOR HE WAS BURNING ALL THAT MET HIS EYE.

MR. YATES WAS BEGINNING NOW TO UNDERSTAND SIR THOMAS'S INTENTIONS,
THOUGH AS FAR AS EVER FROM UNDERSTANDING THEIR SOURCE. HE AND HIS FRIEND
HAD BEEN OUT WITH THEIR GUNS THE CHIEF OF THE MORNING, AND TOM HAD TAKEN
THE OPPORTUNITY OF EXPLAINING, WITH PROPER APOLOGIES FOR HIS FATHER'S
PARTICULARITY, WHAT WAS TO BE EXPECTED. MR. YATES FELT IT AS ACUTELY AS
MIGHT BE SUPPOSED. TO BE A SECOND TIME DISAPPOINTED IN THE SAME WAY WAS
AN INSTANCE OF VERY SEVERE ILL-LUCK; AND HIS INDIGNATION WAS SUCH,
THAT HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR DELICACY TOWARDS HIS FRIEND, AND HIS FRIEND'S
YOUNGEST SISTER, HE BELIEVED HE SHOULD CERTAINLY ATTACK THE BARONET
ON THE ABSURDITY OF HIS PROCEEDINGS, AND ARGUE HIM INTO A LITTLE MORE
RATIONALITY. HE BELIEVED THIS VERY STOUTLY WHILE HE WAS IN MANSFIELD
WOOD, AND ALL THE WAY HOME; BUT THERE WAS A SOMETHING IN SIR THOMAS,
WHEN THEY SAT ROUND THE SAME TABLE, WHICH MADE MR. YATES THINK IT
WISER TO LET HIM PURSUE HIS OWN WAY, AND FEEL THE FOLLY OF IT WITHOUT
OPPOSITION. HE HAD KNOWN MANY DISAGREEABLE FATHERS BEFORE, AND OFTEN
BEEN STRUCK WITH THE INCONVENIENCES THEY OCCASIONED, BUT NEVER, IN
THE WHOLE COURSE OF HIS LIFE, HAD HE SEEN ONE OF THAT CLASS SO
UNINTELLIGIBLY MORAL, SO INFAMOUSLY TYRANNICAL AS SIR THOMAS. HE WAS
NOT A MAN TO BE ENDURED BUT FOR HIS CHILDREN'S SAKE, AND HE MIGHT BE
THANKFUL TO HIS FAIR DAUGHTER JULIA THAT MR. YATES DID YET MEAN TO STAY
A FEW DAYS LONGER UNDER HIS ROOF.

THE EVENING PASSED WITH EXTERNAL SMOOTHNESS, THOUGH ALMOST EVERY
MIND WAS RUFFLED; AND THE MUSIC WHICH SIR THOMAS CALLED FOR FROM HIS
DAUGHTERS HELPED TO CONCEAL THE WANT OF REAL HARMONY. MARIA WAS IN A
GOOD DEAL OF AGITATION. IT WAS OF THE UTMOST CONSEQUENCE TO HER THAT
CRAWFORD SHOULD NOW LOSE NO TIME IN DECLARING HIMSELF, AND SHE WAS
DISTURBED THAT EVEN A DAY SHOULD BE GONE BY WITHOUT SEEMING TO ADVANCE
THAT POINT. SHE HAD BEEN EXPECTING TO SEE HIM THE WHOLE MORNING, AND
ALL THE EVENING, TOO, WAS STILL EXPECTING HIM. MR. RUSHWORTH HAD SET OFF
EARLY WITH THE GREAT NEWS FOR SOTHERTON; AND SHE HAD FONDLY HOPED FOR
SUCH AN IMMEDIATE ECLAIRCISSEMENT AS MIGHT SAVE HIM THE TROUBLE OF
EVER COMING BACK AGAIN. BUT THEY HAD SEEN NO ONE FROM THE PARSONAGE,
NOT A CREATURE, AND HAD HEARD NO TIDINGS BEYOND A FRIENDLY NOTE OF
CONGRATULATION AND INQUIRY FROM MRS. GRANT TO LADY BERTRAM. IT WAS THE
FIRST DAY FOR MANY, MANY WEEKS, IN WHICH THE FAMILIES HAD BEEN WHOLLY
DIVIDED. FOUR-AND-TWENTY HOURS HAD NEVER PASSED BEFORE, SINCE AUGUST
BEGAN, WITHOUT BRINGING THEM TOGETHER IN SOME WAY OR OTHER. IT WAS A
SAD, ANXIOUS DAY; AND THE MORROW, THOUGH DIFFERING IN THE SORT OF EVIL,
DID BY NO MEANS BRING LESS. A FEW MOMENTS OF FEVERISH ENJOYMENT WERE
FOLLOWED BY HOURS OF ACUTE SUFFERING. HENRY CRAWFORD WAS AGAIN IN THE
HOUSE: HE WALKED UP WITH DR. GRANT, WHO WAS ANXIOUS TO PAY HIS RESPECTS
TO SIR THOMAS, AND AT RATHER AN EARLY HOUR THEY WERE USHERED INTO THE
BREAKFAST-ROOM, WHERE WERE MOST OF THE FAMILY. SIR THOMAS SOON APPEARED,
AND MARIA SAW WITH DELIGHT AND AGITATION THE INTRODUCTION OF THE MAN SHE
LOVED TO HER FATHER. HER SENSATIONS WERE INDEFINABLE, AND SO WERE THEY
A FEW MINUTES AFTERWARDS UPON HEARING HENRY CRAWFORD, WHO HAD A CHAIR
BETWEEN HERSELF AND TOM, ASK THE LATTER IN AN UNDERVOICE WHETHER
THERE WERE ANY PLANS FOR RESUMING THE PLAY AFTER THE PRESENT HAPPY
INTERRUPTION (WITH A COURTEOUS GLANCE AT SIR THOMAS), BECAUSE, IN THAT
CASE, HE SHOULD MAKE A POINT OF RETURNING TO MANSFIELD AT ANY TIME
REQUIRED BY THE PARTY: HE WAS GOING AWAY IMMEDIATELY, BEING TO MEET HIS
UNCLE AT BATH WITHOUT DELAY; BUT IF THERE WERE ANY PROSPECT OF A RENEWAL
OF LOVERS' VOWS, HE SHOULD HOLD HIMSELF POSITIVELY ENGAGED, HE SHOULD
BREAK THROUGH EVERY OTHER CLAIM, HE SHOULD ABSOLUTELY CONDITION WITH HIS
UNCLE FOR ATTENDING THEM WHENEVER HE MIGHT BE WANTED. THE PLAY SHOULD
NOT BE LOST BY HIS ABSENCE.

"FROM BATH, NORFOLK, LONDON, YORK, WHEREVER I MAY BE," SAID HE; "I WILL
ATTEND YOU FROM ANY PLACE IN ENGLAND, AT AN HOUR'S NOTICE."

IT WAS WELL AT THAT MOMENT THAT TOM HAD TO SPEAK, AND NOT HIS SISTER. HE
COULD IMMEDIATELY SAY WITH EASY FLUENCY, "I AM SORRY YOU ARE GOING;
BUT AS TO OUR PLAY, THAT IS ALL OVER--ENTIRELY AT AN END" (LOOKING
SIGNIFICANTLY AT HIS FATHER). "THE PAINTER WAS SENT OFF YESTERDAY, AND
VERY LITTLE WILL REMAIN OF THE THEATRE TO-MORROW. I KNEW HOW THAT
WOULD BE FROM THE FIRST. IT IS EARLY FOR BATH. YOU WILL FIND NOBODY
THERE."

"IT IS ABOUT MY UNCLE'S USUAL TIME."

"WHEN DO YOU THINK OF GOING?"

"I MAY, PERHAPS, GET AS FAR AS BANBURY TO-DAY."

"WHOSE STABLES DO YOU USE AT BATH?" WAS THE NEXT QUESTION; AND WHILE
THIS BRANCH OF THE SUBJECT WAS UNDER DISCUSSION, MARIA, WHO WANTED
NEITHER PRIDE NOR RESOLUTION, WAS PREPARING TO ENCOUNTER HER SHARE OF IT
WITH TOLERABLE CALMNESS.

TO HER HE SOON TURNED, REPEATING MUCH OF WHAT HE HAD ALREADY SAID, WITH
ONLY A SOFTENED AIR AND STRONGER EXPRESSIONS OF REGRET. BUT WHAT AVAILED
HIS EXPRESSIONS OR HIS AIR? HE WAS GOING, AND, IF NOT VOLUNTARILY GOING,
VOLUNTARILY INTENDING TO STAY AWAY; FOR, EXCEPTING WHAT MIGHT BE DUE
TO HIS UNCLE, HIS ENGAGEMENTS WERE ALL SELF-IMPOSED. HE MIGHT TALK OF
NECESSITY, BUT SHE KNEW HIS INDEPENDENCE. THE HAND WHICH HAD SO PRESSED
HERS TO HIS HEART! THE HAND AND THE HEART WERE ALIKE MOTIONLESS AND
PASSIVE NOW! HER SPIRIT SUPPORTED HER, BUT THE AGONY OF HER MIND WAS
SEVERE. SHE HAD NOT LONG TO ENDURE WHAT AROSE FROM LISTENING TO LANGUAGE
WHICH HIS ACTIONS CONTRADICTED, OR TO BURY THE TUMULT OF HER FEELINGS
UNDER THE RESTRAINT OF SOCIETY; FOR GENERAL CIVILITIES SOON CALLED
HIS NOTICE FROM HER, AND THE FAREWELL VISIT, AS IT THEN BECAME OPENLY
ACKNOWLEDGED, WAS A VERY SHORT ONE. HE WAS GONE--HE HAD TOUCHED HER
HAND FOR THE LAST TIME, HE HAD MADE HIS PARTING BOW, AND SHE MIGHT SEEK
DIRECTLY ALL THAT SOLITUDE COULD DO FOR HER. HENRY CRAWFORD WAS GONE,
GONE FROM THE HOUSE, AND WITHIN TWO HOURS AFTERWARDS FROM THE PARISH;
AND SO ENDED ALL THE HOPES HIS SELFISH VANITY HAD RAISED IN MARIA AND
JULIA BERTRAM.

JULIA COULD REJOICE THAT HE WAS GONE. HIS PRESENCE WAS BEGINNING TO BE
ODIOUS TO HER; AND IF MARIA GAINED HIM NOT, SHE WAS NOW COOL ENOUGH TO
DISPENSE WITH ANY OTHER REVENGE. SHE DID NOT WANT EXPOSURE TO BE ADDED
TO DESERTION. HENRY CRAWFORD GONE, SHE COULD EVEN PITY HER SISTER.

WITH A PURER SPIRIT DID FANNY REJOICE IN THE INTELLIGENCE. SHE HEARD IT
AT DINNER, AND FELT IT A BLESSING. BY ALL THE OTHERS IT WAS MENTIONED
WITH REGRET; AND HIS MERITS HONOURED WITH DUE GRADATION OF FEELING--FROM
THE SINCERITY OF EDMUND'S TOO PARTIAL REGARD, TO THE UNCONCERN OF HIS
MOTHER SPEAKING ENTIRELY BY ROTE. MRS. NORRIS BEGAN TO LOOK ABOUT HER,
AND WONDER THAT HIS FALLING IN LOVE WITH JULIA HAD COME TO NOTHING; AND
COULD ALMOST FEAR THAT SHE HAD BEEN REMISS HERSELF IN FORWARDING IT; BUT
WITH SO MANY TO CARE FOR, HOW WAS IT POSSIBLE FOR EVEN HER ACTIVITY TO
KEEP PACE WITH HER WISHES?

ANOTHER DAY OR TWO, AND MR. YATES WAS GONE LIKEWISE. IN HIS DEPARTURE
SIR THOMAS FELT THE CHIEF INTEREST: WANTING TO BE ALONE WITH HIS FAMILY,
THE PRESENCE OF A STRANGER SUPERIOR TO MR. YATES MUST HAVE BEEN IRKSOME;
BUT OF HIM, TRIFLING AND CONFIDENT, IDLE AND EXPENSIVE, IT WAS EVERY WAY
VEXATIOUS. IN HIMSELF HE WAS WEARISOME, BUT AS THE FRIEND OF TOM AND
THE ADMIRER OF JULIA HE BECAME OFFENSIVE. SIR THOMAS HAD BEEN QUITE
INDIFFERENT TO MR. CRAWFORD'S GOING OR STAYING: BUT HIS GOOD WISHES
FOR MR. YATES'S HAVING A PLEASANT JOURNEY, AS HE WALKED WITH HIM TO THE
HALL-DOOR, WERE GIVEN WITH GENUINE SATISFACTION. MR. YATES HAD STAID TO
SEE THE DESTRUCTION OF EVERY THEATRICAL PREPARATION AT MANSFIELD, THE
REMOVAL OF EVERYTHING APPERTAINING TO THE PLAY: HE LEFT THE HOUSE IN ALL
THE SOBERNESS OF ITS GENERAL CHARACTER; AND SIR THOMAS HOPED, IN SEEING
HIM OUT OF IT, TO BE RID OF THE WORST OBJECT CONNECTED WITH THE SCHEME,
AND THE LAST THAT MUST BE INEVITABLY REMINDING HIM OF ITS EXISTENCE.

MRS. NORRIS CONTRIVED TO REMOVE ONE ARTICLE FROM HIS SIGHT THAT MIGHT
HAVE DISTRESSED HIM. THE CURTAIN, OVER WHICH SHE HAD PRESIDED WITH SUCH
TALENT AND SUCH SUCCESS, WENT OFF WITH HER TO HER COTTAGE, WHERE SHE
HAPPENED TO BE PARTICULARLY IN WANT OF GREEN BAIZE.



CHAPTER XXI

SIR THOMAS'S RETURN MADE A STRIKING CHANGE IN THE WAYS OF THE FAMILY,
INDEPENDENT OF LOVERS' VOWS. UNDER HIS GOVERNMENT, MANSFIELD WAS AN
ALTERED PLACE. SOME MEMBERS OF THEIR SOCIETY SENT AWAY, AND THE SPIRITS
OF MANY OTHERS SADDENED--IT WAS ALL SAMENESS AND GLOOM COMPARED WITH
THE PAST--A SOMBRE FAMILY PARTY RARELY ENLIVENED. THERE WAS LITTLE
INTERCOURSE WITH THE PARSONAGE. SIR THOMAS, DRAWING BACK FROM INTIMACIES
IN GENERAL, WAS PARTICULARLY DISINCLINED, AT THIS TIME, FOR ANY
ENGAGEMENTS BUT IN ONE QUARTER. THE RUSHWORTHS WERE THE ONLY ADDITION TO
HIS OWN DOMESTIC CIRCLE WHICH HE COULD SOLICIT.

EDMUND DID NOT WONDER THAT SUCH SHOULD BE HIS FATHER'S FEELINGS, NOR
COULD HE REGRET ANYTHING BUT THE EXCLUSION OF THE GRANTS. "BUT THEY," HE
OBSERVED TO FANNY, "HAVE A CLAIM. THEY SEEM TO BELONG TO US; THEY SEEM
TO BE PART OF OURSELVES. I COULD WISH MY FATHER WERE MORE SENSIBLE OF
THEIR VERY GREAT ATTENTION TO MY MOTHER AND SISTERS WHILE HE WAS AWAY. I
AM AFRAID THEY MAY FEEL THEMSELVES NEGLECTED. BUT THE TRUTH IS, THAT MY
FATHER HARDLY KNOWS THEM. THEY HAD NOT BEEN HERE A TWELVEMONTH WHEN HE
LEFT ENGLAND. IF HE KNEW THEM BETTER, HE WOULD VALUE THEIR SOCIETY AS IT
DESERVES; FOR THEY ARE IN FACT EXACTLY THE SORT OF PEOPLE HE WOULD
LIKE. WE ARE SOMETIMES A LITTLE IN WANT OF ANIMATION AMONG OURSELVES: MY
SISTERS SEEM OUT OF SPIRITS, AND TOM IS CERTAINLY NOT AT HIS EASE. DR.
AND MRS. GRANT WOULD ENLIVEN US, AND MAKE OUR EVENINGS PASS AWAY WITH
MORE ENJOYMENT EVEN TO MY FATHER."

"DO YOU THINK SO?" SAID FANNY: "IN MY OPINION, MY UNCLE WOULD NOT LIKE
ANY ADDITION. I THINK HE VALUES THE VERY QUIETNESS YOU SPEAK OF, AND
THAT THE REPOSE OF HIS OWN FAMILY CIRCLE IS ALL HE WANTS. AND IT DOES
NOT APPEAR TO ME THAT WE ARE MORE SERIOUS THAN WE USED TO BE--I MEAN
BEFORE MY UNCLE WENT ABROAD. AS WELL AS I CAN RECOLLECT, IT WAS ALWAYS
MUCH THE SAME. THERE WAS NEVER MUCH LAUGHING IN HIS PRESENCE; OR, IF
THERE IS ANY DIFFERENCE, IT IS NOT MORE, I THINK, THAN SUCH AN ABSENCE
HAS A TENDENCY TO PRODUCE AT FIRST. THERE MUST BE A SORT OF SHYNESS; BUT
I CANNOT RECOLLECT THAT OUR EVENINGS FORMERLY WERE EVER MERRY, EXCEPT
WHEN MY UNCLE WAS IN TOWN. NO YOUNG PEOPLE'S ARE, I SUPPOSE, WHEN THOSE
THEY LOOK UP TO ARE AT HOME".

"I BELIEVE YOU ARE RIGHT, FANNY," WAS HIS REPLY, AFTER A SHORT
CONSIDERATION. "I BELIEVE OUR EVENINGS ARE RATHER RETURNED TO WHAT THEY
WERE, THAN ASSUMING A NEW CHARACTER. THE NOVELTY WAS IN THEIR BEING
LIVELY. YET, HOW STRONG THE IMPRESSION THAT ONLY A FEW WEEKS WILL GIVE!
I HAVE BEEN FEELING AS IF WE HAD NEVER LIVED SO BEFORE."

"I SUPPOSE I AM GRAVER THAN OTHER PEOPLE," SAID FANNY. "THE EVENINGS DO
NOT APPEAR LONG TO ME. I LOVE TO HEAR MY UNCLE TALK OF THE WEST INDIES.
I COULD LISTEN TO HIM FOR AN HOUR TOGETHER. IT ENTERTAINS ME MORE THAN
MANY OTHER THINGS HAVE DONE; BUT THEN I AM UNLIKE OTHER PEOPLE, I DARE
SAY."

"WHY SHOULD YOU DARE SAY THAT?" (SMILING). "DO YOU WANT TO BE TOLD
THAT YOU ARE ONLY UNLIKE OTHER PEOPLE IN BEING MORE WISE AND DISCREET?
BUT WHEN DID YOU, OR ANYBODY, EVER GET A COMPLIMENT FROM ME, FANNY? GO
TO MY FATHER IF YOU WANT TO BE COMPLIMENTED. HE WILL SATISFY YOU. ASK
YOUR UNCLE WHAT HE THINKS, AND YOU WILL HEAR COMPLIMENTS ENOUGH: AND
THOUGH THEY MAY BE CHIEFLY ON YOUR PERSON, YOU MUST PUT UP WITH IT, AND
TRUST TO HIS SEEING AS MUCH BEAUTY OF MIND IN TIME."

SUCH LANGUAGE WAS SO NEW TO FANNY THAT IT QUITE EMBARRASSED HER.

"YOUR UNCLE THINKS YOU VERY PRETTY, DEAR FANNY--AND THAT IS THE LONG AND
THE SHORT OF THE MATTER. ANYBODY BUT MYSELF WOULD HAVE MADE SOMETHING
MORE OF IT, AND ANYBODY BUT YOU WOULD RESENT THAT YOU HAD NOT BEEN
THOUGHT VERY PRETTY BEFORE; BUT THE TRUTH IS, THAT YOUR UNCLE NEVER
DID ADMIRE YOU TILL NOW--AND NOW HE DOES. YOUR COMPLEXION IS SO
IMPROVED!--AND YOU HAVE GAINED SO MUCH COUNTENANCE!--AND YOUR
FIGURE--NAY, FANNY, DO NOT TURN AWAY ABOUT IT--IT IS BUT AN UNCLE. IF
YOU CANNOT BEAR AN UNCLE'S ADMIRATION, WHAT IS TO BECOME OF YOU? YOU
MUST REALLY BEGIN TO HARDEN YOURSELF TO THE IDEA OF BEING WORTH LOOKING
AT. YOU MUST TRY NOT TO MIND GROWING UP INTO A PRETTY WOMAN."

"OH! DON'T TALK SO, DON'T TALK SO," CRIED FANNY, DISTRESSED BY MORE
FEELINGS THAN HE WAS AWARE OF; BUT SEEING THAT SHE WAS DISTRESSED, HE
HAD DONE WITH THE SUBJECT, AND ONLY ADDED MORE SERIOUSLY--

"YOUR UNCLE IS DISPOSED TO BE PLEASED WITH YOU IN EVERY RESPECT; AND I
ONLY WISH YOU WOULD TALK TO HIM MORE. YOU ARE ONE OF THOSE WHO ARE TOO
SILENT IN THE EVENING CIRCLE."

"BUT I DO TALK TO HIM MORE THAN I USED. I AM SURE I DO. DID NOT YOU HEAR
ME ASK HIM ABOUT THE SLAVE-TRADE LAST NIGHT?"

"I DID--AND WAS IN HOPES THE QUESTION WOULD BE FOLLOWED UP BY OTHERS. IT
WOULD HAVE PLEASED YOUR UNCLE TO BE INQUIRED OF FARTHER."

"AND I LONGED TO DO IT--BUT THERE WAS SUCH A DEAD SILENCE! AND WHILE
MY COUSINS WERE SITTING BY WITHOUT SPEAKING A WORD, OR SEEMING AT ALL
INTERESTED IN THE SUBJECT, I DID NOT LIKE--I THOUGHT IT WOULD APPEAR AS
IF I WANTED TO SET MYSELF OFF AT THEIR EXPENSE, BY SHEWING A CURIOSITY
AND PLEASURE IN HIS INFORMATION WHICH HE MUST WISH HIS OWN DAUGHTERS TO
FEEL."

"MISS CRAWFORD WAS VERY RIGHT IN WHAT SHE SAID OF YOU THE OTHER DAY:
THAT YOU SEEMED ALMOST AS FEARFUL OF NOTICE AND PRAISE AS OTHER WOMEN
WERE OF NEGLECT. WE WERE TALKING OF YOU AT THE PARSONAGE, AND THOSE WERE
HER WORDS. SHE HAS GREAT DISCERNMENT. I KNOW NOBODY WHO DISTINGUISHES
CHARACTERS BETTER. FOR SO YOUNG A WOMAN IT IS REMARKABLE! SHE CERTAINLY
UNDERSTANDS YOU BETTER THAN YOU ARE UNDERSTOOD BY THE GREATER PART OF
THOSE WHO HAVE KNOWN YOU SO LONG; AND WITH REGARD TO SOME OTHERS, I CAN
PERCEIVE, FROM OCCASIONAL LIVELY HINTS, THE UNGUARDED EXPRESSIONS OF
THE MOMENT, THAT SHE COULD DEFINE MANY AS ACCURATELY, DID NOT DELICACY
FORBID IT. I WONDER WHAT SHE THINKS OF MY FATHER! SHE MUST ADMIRE HIM
AS A FINE-LOOKING MAN, WITH MOST GENTLEMANLIKE, DIGNIFIED, CONSISTENT
MANNERS; BUT PERHAPS, HAVING SEEN HIM SO SELDOM, HIS RESERVE MAY BE
A LITTLE REPULSIVE. COULD THEY BE MUCH TOGETHER, I FEEL SURE OF THEIR
LIKING EACH OTHER. HE WOULD ENJOY HER LIVELINESS AND SHE HAS TALENTS TO
VALUE HIS POWERS. I WISH THEY MET MORE FREQUENTLY! I HOPE SHE DOES NOT
SUPPOSE THERE IS ANY DISLIKE ON HIS SIDE."

"SHE MUST KNOW HERSELF TOO SECURE OF THE REGARD OF ALL THE REST OF YOU,"
SAID FANNY, WITH HALF A SIGH, "TO HAVE ANY SUCH APPREHENSION. AND SIR
THOMAS'S WISHING JUST AT FIRST TO BE ONLY WITH HIS FAMILY, IS SO VERY
NATURAL, THAT SHE CAN ARGUE NOTHING FROM THAT. AFTER A LITTLE WHILE, I
DARE SAY, WE SHALL BE MEETING AGAIN IN THE SAME SORT OF WAY, ALLOWING
FOR THE DIFFERENCE OF THE TIME OF YEAR."

"THIS IS THE FIRST OCTOBER THAT SHE HAS PASSED IN THE COUNTRY SINCE HER
INFANCY. I DO NOT CALL TUNBRIDGE OR CHELTENHAM THE COUNTRY; AND NOVEMBER
IS A STILL MORE SERIOUS MONTH, AND I CAN SEE THAT MRS. GRANT IS VERY
ANXIOUS FOR HER NOT FINDING MANSFIELD DULL AS WINTER COMES ON."

FANNY COULD HAVE SAID A GREAT DEAL, BUT IT WAS SAFER TO SAY NOTHING, AND
LEAVE UNTOUCHED ALL MISS CRAWFORD'S RESOURCES--HER ACCOMPLISHMENTS, HER
SPIRITS, HER IMPORTANCE, HER FRIENDS, LEST IT SHOULD BETRAY HER INTO
ANY OBSERVATIONS SEEMINGLY UNHANDSOME. MISS CRAWFORD'S KIND OPINION OF
HERSELF DESERVED AT LEAST A GRATEFUL FORBEARANCE, AND SHE BEGAN TO TALK
OF SOMETHING ELSE.

"TO-MORROW, I THINK, MY UNCLE DINES AT SOTHERTON, AND YOU AND MR.
BERTRAM TOO. WE SHALL BE QUITE A SMALL PARTY AT HOME. I HOPE MY UNCLE
MAY CONTINUE TO LIKE MR. RUSHWORTH."

"THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE, FANNY. HE MUST LIKE HIM LESS AFTER TO-MORROW'S
VISIT, FOR WE SHALL BE FIVE HOURS IN HIS COMPANY. I SHOULD DREAD
THE STUPIDITY OF THE DAY, IF THERE WERE NOT A MUCH GREATER EVIL TO
FOLLOW--THE IMPRESSION IT MUST LEAVE ON SIR THOMAS. HE CANNOT MUCH
LONGER DECEIVE HIMSELF. I AM SORRY FOR THEM ALL, AND WOULD GIVE
SOMETHING THAT RUSHWORTH AND MARIA HAD NEVER MET."

IN THIS QUARTER, INDEED, DISAPPOINTMENT WAS IMPENDING OVER SIR THOMAS.
NOT ALL HIS GOOD-WILL FOR MR. RUSHWORTH, NOT ALL MR. RUSHWORTH'S
DEFERENCE FOR HIM, COULD PREVENT HIM FROM SOON DISCERNING SOME PART OF
THE TRUTH--THAT MR. RUSHWORTH WAS AN INFERIOR YOUNG MAN, AS IGNORANT
IN BUSINESS AS IN BOOKS, WITH OPINIONS IN GENERAL UNFIXED, AND WITHOUT
SEEMING MUCH AWARE OF IT HIMSELF.

HE HAD EXPECTED A VERY DIFFERENT SON-IN-LAW; AND BEGINNING TO FEEL
GRAVE ON MARIA'S ACCOUNT, TRIED TO UNDERSTAND HER FEELINGS. LITTLE
OBSERVATION THERE WAS NECESSARY TO TELL HIM THAT INDIFFERENCE WAS THE
MOST FAVOURABLE STATE THEY COULD BE IN. HER BEHAVIOUR TO MR. RUSHWORTH
WAS CARELESS AND COLD. SHE COULD NOT, DID NOT LIKE HIM. SIR THOMAS
RESOLVED TO SPEAK SERIOUSLY TO HER. ADVANTAGEOUS AS WOULD BE THE
ALLIANCE, AND LONG STANDING AND PUBLIC AS WAS THE ENGAGEMENT, HER
HAPPINESS MUST NOT BE SACRIFICED TO IT. MR. RUSHWORTH HAD, PERHAPS, BEEN
ACCEPTED ON TOO SHORT AN ACQUAINTANCE, AND, ON KNOWING HIM BETTER, SHE
WAS REPENTING.

WITH SOLEMN KINDNESS SIR THOMAS ADDRESSED HER: TOLD HER HIS FEARS,
INQUIRED INTO HER WISHES, ENTREATED HER TO BE OPEN AND SINCERE, AND
ASSURED HER THAT EVERY INCONVENIENCE SHOULD BE BRAVED, AND THE CONNEXION
ENTIRELY GIVEN UP, IF SHE FELT HERSELF UNHAPPY IN THE PROSPECT OF IT. HE
WOULD ACT FOR HER AND RELEASE HER. MARIA HAD A MOMENT'S STRUGGLE AS SHE
LISTENED, AND ONLY A MOMENT'S: WHEN HER FATHER CEASED, SHE WAS ABLE TO
GIVE HER ANSWER IMMEDIATELY, DECIDEDLY, AND WITH NO APPARENT AGITATION.
SHE THANKED HIM FOR HIS GREAT ATTENTION, HIS PATERNAL KINDNESS, BUT HE
WAS QUITE MISTAKEN IN SUPPOSING SHE HAD THE SMALLEST DESIRE OF BREAKING
THROUGH HER ENGAGEMENT, OR WAS SENSIBLE OF ANY CHANGE OF OPINION OR
INCLINATION SINCE HER FORMING IT. SHE HAD THE HIGHEST ESTEEM FOR MR.
RUSHWORTH'S CHARACTER AND DISPOSITION, AND COULD NOT HAVE A DOUBT OF HER
HAPPINESS WITH HIM.

SIR THOMAS WAS SATISFIED; TOO GLAD TO BE SATISFIED, PERHAPS, TO URGE THE
MATTER QUITE SO FAR AS HIS JUDGMENT MIGHT HAVE DICTATED TO OTHERS. IT
WAS AN ALLIANCE WHICH HE COULD NOT HAVE RELINQUISHED WITHOUT PAIN;
AND THUS HE REASONED. MR. RUSHWORTH WAS YOUNG ENOUGH TO IMPROVE. MR.
RUSHWORTH MUST AND WOULD IMPROVE IN GOOD SOCIETY; AND IF MARIA COULD NOW
SPEAK SO SECURELY OF HER HAPPINESS WITH HIM, SPEAKING CERTAINLY WITHOUT
THE PREJUDICE, THE BLINDNESS OF LOVE, SHE OUGHT TO BE BELIEVED. HER
FEELINGS, PROBABLY, WERE NOT ACUTE; HE HAD NEVER SUPPOSED THEM TO BE
SO; BUT HER COMFORTS MIGHT NOT BE LESS ON THAT ACCOUNT; AND IF SHE COULD
DISPENSE WITH SEEING HER HUSBAND A LEADING, SHINING CHARACTER, THERE
WOULD CERTAINLY BE EVERYTHING ELSE IN HER FAVOUR. A WELL-DISPOSED YOUNG
WOMAN, WHO DID NOT MARRY FOR LOVE, WAS IN GENERAL BUT THE MORE ATTACHED
TO HER OWN FAMILY; AND THE NEARNESS OF SOTHERTON TO MANSFIELD
MUST NATURALLY HOLD OUT THE GREATEST TEMPTATION, AND WOULD, IN ALL
PROBABILITY, BE A CONTINUAL SUPPLY OF THE MOST AMIABLE AND INNOCENT
ENJOYMENTS. SUCH AND SUCH-LIKE WERE THE REASONINGS OF SIR THOMAS,
HAPPY TO ESCAPE THE EMBARRASSING EVILS OF A RUPTURE, THE WONDER,
THE REFLECTIONS, THE REPROACH THAT MUST ATTEND IT; HAPPY TO SECURE A
MARRIAGE WHICH WOULD BRING HIM SUCH AN ADDITION OF RESPECTABILITY
AND INFLUENCE, AND VERY HAPPY TO THINK ANYTHING OF HIS DAUGHTER'S
DISPOSITION THAT WAS MOST FAVOURABLE FOR THE PURPOSE.

TO HER THE CONFERENCE CLOSED AS SATISFACTORILY AS TO HIM. SHE WAS IN A
STATE OF MIND TO BE GLAD THAT SHE HAD SECURED HER FATE BEYOND RECALL:
THAT SHE HAD PLEDGED HERSELF ANEW TO SOTHERTON; THAT SHE WAS SAFE FROM
THE POSSIBILITY OF GIVING CRAWFORD THE TRIUMPH OF GOVERNING HER ACTIONS,
AND DESTROYING HER PROSPECTS; AND RETIRED IN PROUD RESOLVE, DETERMINED
ONLY TO BEHAVE MORE CAUTIOUSLY TO MR. RUSHWORTH IN FUTURE, THAT HER
FATHER MIGHT NOT BE AGAIN SUSPECTING HER.

HAD SIR THOMAS APPLIED TO HIS DAUGHTER WITHIN THE FIRST THREE OR FOUR
DAYS AFTER HENRY CRAWFORD'S LEAVING MANSFIELD, BEFORE HER FEELINGS WERE
AT ALL TRANQUILLISED, BEFORE SHE HAD GIVEN UP EVERY HOPE OF HIM, OR
ABSOLUTELY RESOLVED ON ENDURING HIS RIVAL, HER ANSWER MIGHT HAVE BEEN
DIFFERENT; BUT AFTER ANOTHER THREE OR FOUR DAYS, WHEN THERE WAS NO
RETURN, NO LETTER, NO MESSAGE, NO SYMPTOM OF A SOFTENED HEART, NO HOPE
OF ADVANTAGE FROM SEPARATION, HER MIND BECAME COOL ENOUGH TO SEEK ALL
THE COMFORT THAT PRIDE AND SELF REVENGE COULD GIVE.

HENRY CRAWFORD HAD DESTROYED HER HAPPINESS, BUT HE SHOULD NOT KNOW THAT
HE HAD DONE IT; HE SHOULD NOT DESTROY HER CREDIT, HER APPEARANCE, HER
PROSPERITY, TOO. HE SHOULD NOT HAVE TO THINK OF HER AS PINING IN THE
RETIREMENT OF MANSFIELD FOR HIM, REJECTING SOTHERTON AND LONDON,
INDEPENDENCE AND SPLENDOUR, FOR HIS SAKE. INDEPENDENCE WAS MORE
NEEDFUL THAN EVER; THE WANT OF IT AT MANSFIELD MORE SENSIBLY FELT. SHE
WAS LESS AND LESS ABLE TO ENDURE THE RESTRAINT WHICH HER FATHER IMPOSED.
THE LIBERTY WHICH HIS ABSENCE HAD GIVEN WAS NOW BECOME ABSOLUTELY
NECESSARY. SHE MUST ESCAPE FROM HIM AND MANSFIELD AS SOON AS POSSIBLE,
AND FIND CONSOLATION IN FORTUNE AND CONSEQUENCE, BUSTLE AND THE WORLD,
FOR A WOUNDED SPIRIT. HER MIND WAS QUITE DETERMINED, AND VARIED NOT.

TO SUCH FEELINGS DELAY, EVEN THE DELAY OF MUCH PREPARATION, WOULD HAVE
BEEN AN EVIL, AND MR. RUSHWORTH COULD HARDLY BE MORE IMPATIENT FOR THE
MARRIAGE THAN HERSELF. IN ALL THE IMPORTANT PREPARATIONS OF THE MIND
SHE WAS COMPLETE: BEING PREPARED FOR MATRIMONY BY AN HATRED OF HOME,
RESTRAINT, AND TRANQUILLITY; BY THE MISERY OF DISAPPOINTED AFFECTION,
AND CONTEMPT OF THE MAN SHE WAS TO MARRY. THE REST MIGHT WAIT. THE
PREPARATIONS OF NEW CARRIAGES AND FURNITURE MIGHT WAIT FOR LONDON AND
SPRING, WHEN HER OWN TASTE COULD HAVE FAIRER PLAY.

THE PRINCIPALS BEING ALL AGREED IN THIS RESPECT, IT SOON APPEARED THAT A
VERY FEW WEEKS WOULD BE SUFFICIENT FOR SUCH ARRANGEMENTS AS MUST PRECEDE
THE WEDDING.

MRS. RUSHWORTH WAS QUITE READY TO RETIRE, AND MAKE WAY FOR THE FORTUNATE
YOUNG WOMAN WHOM HER DEAR SON HAD SELECTED; AND VERY EARLY IN NOVEMBER
REMOVED HERSELF, HER MAID, HER FOOTMAN, AND HER CHARIOT, WITH TRUE
DOWAGER PROPRIETY, TO BATH, THERE TO PARADE OVER THE WONDERS OF
SOTHERTON IN HER EVENING PARTIES; ENJOYING THEM AS THOROUGHLY, PERHAPS,
IN THE ANIMATION OF A CARD-TABLE, AS SHE HAD EVER DONE ON THE SPOT; AND
BEFORE THE MIDDLE OF THE SAME MONTH THE CEREMONY HAD TAKEN PLACE WHICH
GAVE SOTHERTON ANOTHER MISTRESS.

IT WAS A VERY PROPER WEDDING. THE BRIDE WAS ELEGANTLY DRESSED; THE TWO
BRIDESMAIDS WERE DULY INFERIOR; HER FATHER GAVE HER AWAY; HER MOTHER
STOOD WITH SALTS IN HER HAND, EXPECTING TO BE AGITATED; HER AUNT TRIED
TO CRY; AND THE SERVICE WAS IMPRESSIVELY READ BY DR. GRANT. NOTHING
COULD BE OBJECTED TO WHEN IT CAME UNDER THE DISCUSSION OF THE
NEIGHBOURHOOD, EXCEPT THAT THE CARRIAGE WHICH CONVEYED THE BRIDE AND
BRIDEGROOM AND JULIA FROM THE CHURCH-DOOR TO SOTHERTON WAS THE SAME
CHAISE WHICH MR. RUSHWORTH HAD USED FOR A TWELVEMONTH BEFORE. IN
EVERYTHING ELSE THE ETIQUETTE OF THE DAY MIGHT STAND THE STRICTEST
INVESTIGATION.

IT WAS DONE, AND THEY WERE GONE. SIR THOMAS FELT AS AN ANXIOUS FATHER
MUST FEEL, AND WAS INDEED EXPERIENCING MUCH OF THE AGITATION WHICH HIS
WIFE HAD BEEN APPREHENSIVE OF FOR HERSELF, BUT HAD FORTUNATELY ESCAPED.
MRS. NORRIS, MOST HAPPY TO ASSIST IN THE DUTIES OF THE DAY, BY SPENDING
IT AT THE PARK TO SUPPORT HER SISTER'S SPIRITS, AND DRINKING THE HEALTH
OF MR. AND MRS. RUSHWORTH IN A SUPERNUMERARY GLASS OR TWO, WAS ALL
JOYOUS DELIGHT; FOR SHE HAD MADE THE MATCH; SHE HAD DONE EVERYTHING;
AND NO ONE WOULD HAVE SUPPOSED, FROM HER CONFIDENT TRIUMPH, THAT SHE
HAD EVER HEARD OF CONJUGAL INFELICITY IN HER LIFE, OR COULD HAVE THE
SMALLEST INSIGHT INTO THE DISPOSITION OF THE NIECE WHO HAD BEEN BROUGHT
UP UNDER HER EYE.

THE PLAN OF THE YOUNG COUPLE WAS TO PROCEED, AFTER A FEW DAYS, TO
BRIGHTON, AND TAKE A HOUSE THERE FOR SOME WEEKS. EVERY PUBLIC PLACE WAS
NEW TO MARIA, AND BRIGHTON IS ALMOST AS GAY IN WINTER AS IN SUMMER. WHEN
THE NOVELTY OF AMUSEMENT THERE WAS OVER, IT WOULD BE TIME FOR THE WIDER
RANGE OF LONDON.

JULIA WAS TO GO WITH THEM TO BRIGHTON. SINCE RIVALRY BETWEEN THE SISTERS
HAD CEASED, THEY HAD BEEN GRADUALLY RECOVERING MUCH OF THEIR FORMER GOOD
UNDERSTANDING; AND WERE AT LEAST SUFFICIENTLY FRIENDS TO MAKE EACH OF
THEM EXCEEDINGLY GLAD TO BE WITH THE OTHER AT SUCH A TIME. SOME OTHER
COMPANION THAN MR. RUSHWORTH WAS OF THE FIRST CONSEQUENCE TO HIS LADY;
AND JULIA WAS QUITE AS EAGER FOR NOVELTY AND PLEASURE AS MARIA, THOUGH
SHE MIGHT NOT HAVE STRUGGLED THROUGH SO MUCH TO OBTAIN THEM, AND COULD
BETTER BEAR A SUBORDINATE SITUATION.

THEIR DEPARTURE MADE ANOTHER MATERIAL CHANGE AT MANSFIELD, A CHASM
WHICH REQUIRED SOME TIME TO FILL UP. THE FAMILY CIRCLE BECAME GREATLY
CONTRACTED; AND THOUGH THE MISS BERTRAMS HAD LATTERLY ADDED LITTLE TO
ITS GAIETY, THEY COULD NOT BUT BE MISSED. EVEN THEIR MOTHER MISSED THEM;
AND HOW MUCH MORE THEIR TENDERHEARTED COUSIN, WHO WANDERED ABOUT
THE HOUSE, AND THOUGHT OF THEM, AND FELT FOR THEM, WITH A DEGREE OF
AFFECTIONATE REGRET WHICH THEY HAD NEVER DONE MUCH TO DESERVE!



CHAPTER XXII

FANNY'S CONSEQUENCE INCREASED ON THE DEPARTURE OF HER COUSINS. BECOMING,
AS SHE THEN DID, THE ONLY YOUNG WOMAN IN THE DRAWING-ROOM, THE ONLY
OCCUPIER OF THAT INTERESTING DIVISION OF A FAMILY IN WHICH SHE HAD
HITHERTO HELD SO HUMBLE A THIRD, IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HER NOT TO BE
MORE LOOKED AT, MORE THOUGHT OF AND ATTENDED TO, THAN SHE HAD EVER BEEN
BEFORE; AND "WHERE IS FANNY?" BECAME NO UNCOMMON QUESTION, EVEN WITHOUT
HER BEING WANTED FOR ANY ONE'S CONVENIENCE.

NOT ONLY AT HOME DID HER VALUE INCREASE, BUT AT THE PARSONAGE TOO. IN
THAT HOUSE, WHICH SHE HAD HARDLY ENTERED TWICE A YEAR SINCE MR. NORRIS'S
DEATH, SHE BECAME A WELCOME, AN INVITED GUEST, AND IN THE GLOOM AND DIRT
OF A NOVEMBER DAY, MOST ACCEPTABLE TO MARY CRAWFORD. HER VISITS THERE,
BEGINNING BY CHANCE, WERE CONTINUED BY SOLICITATION. MRS. GRANT,
REALLY EAGER TO GET ANY CHANGE FOR HER SISTER, COULD, BY THE EASIEST
SELF-DECEIT, PERSUADE HERSELF THAT SHE WAS DOING THE KINDEST THING BY
FANNY, AND GIVING HER THE MOST IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITIES OF IMPROVEMENT IN
PRESSING HER FREQUENT CALLS.

FANNY, HAVING BEEN SENT INTO THE VILLAGE ON SOME ERRAND BY HER AUNT
NORRIS, WAS OVERTAKEN BY A HEAVY SHOWER CLOSE TO THE PARSONAGE; AND
BEING DESCRIED FROM ONE OF THE WINDOWS ENDEAVOURING TO FIND SHELTER
UNDER THE BRANCHES AND LINGERING LEAVES OF AN OAK JUST BEYOND THEIR
PREMISES, WAS FORCED, THOUGH NOT WITHOUT SOME MODEST RELUCTANCE ON HER
PART, TO COME IN. A CIVIL SERVANT SHE HAD WITHSTOOD; BUT WHEN DR. GRANT
HIMSELF WENT OUT WITH AN UMBRELLA, THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE DONE BUT TO
BE VERY MUCH ASHAMED, AND TO GET INTO THE HOUSE AS FAST AS POSSIBLE; AND
TO POOR MISS CRAWFORD, WHO HAD JUST BEEN CONTEMPLATING THE DISMAL RAIN
IN A VERY DESPONDING STATE OF MIND, SIGHING OVER THE RUIN OF ALL HER
PLAN OF EXERCISE FOR THAT MORNING, AND OF EVERY CHANCE OF SEEING A
SINGLE CREATURE BEYOND THEMSELVES FOR THE NEXT TWENTY-FOUR HOURS, THE
SOUND OF A LITTLE BUSTLE AT THE FRONT DOOR, AND THE SIGHT OF MISS PRICE
DRIPPING WITH WET IN THE VESTIBULE, WAS DELIGHTFUL. THE VALUE OF AN
EVENT ON A WET DAY IN THE COUNTRY WAS MOST FORCIBLY BROUGHT BEFORE HER.
SHE WAS ALL ALIVE AGAIN DIRECTLY, AND AMONG THE MOST ACTIVE IN BEING
USEFUL TO FANNY, IN DETECTING HER TO BE WETTER THAN SHE WOULD AT FIRST
ALLOW, AND PROVIDING HER WITH DRY CLOTHES; AND FANNY, AFTER BEING
OBLIGED TO SUBMIT TO ALL THIS ATTENTION, AND TO BEING ASSISTED AND
WAITED ON BY MISTRESSES AND MAIDS, BEING ALSO OBLIGED, ON RETURNING
DOWNSTAIRS, TO BE FIXED IN THEIR DRAWING-ROOM FOR AN HOUR WHILE THE RAIN
CONTINUED, THE BLESSING OF SOMETHING FRESH TO SEE AND THINK OF WAS THUS
EXTENDED TO MISS CRAWFORD, AND MIGHT CARRY ON HER SPIRITS TO THE PERIOD
OF DRESSING AND DINNER.

THE TWO SISTERS WERE SO KIND TO HER, AND SO PLEASANT, THAT FANNY MIGHT
HAVE ENJOYED HER VISIT COULD SHE HAVE BELIEVED HERSELF NOT IN THE WAY,
AND COULD SHE HAVE FORESEEN THAT THE WEATHER WOULD CERTAINLY CLEAR AT
THE END OF THE HOUR, AND SAVE HER FROM THE SHAME OF HAVING DR. GRANT'S
CARRIAGE AND HORSES OUT TO TAKE HER HOME, WITH WHICH SHE WAS THREATENED.
AS TO ANXIETY FOR ANY ALARM THAT HER ABSENCE IN SUCH WEATHER MIGHT
OCCASION AT HOME, SHE HAD NOTHING TO SUFFER ON THAT SCORE; FOR AS HER
BEING OUT WAS KNOWN ONLY TO HER TWO AUNTS, SHE WAS PERFECTLY AWARE THAT
NONE WOULD BE FELT, AND THAT IN WHATEVER COTTAGE AUNT NORRIS MIGHT CHUSE
TO ESTABLISH HER DURING THE RAIN, HER BEING IN SUCH COTTAGE WOULD BE
INDUBITABLE TO AUNT BERTRAM.

IT WAS BEGINNING TO LOOK BRIGHTER, WHEN FANNY, OBSERVING A HARP IN THE
ROOM, ASKED SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT IT, WHICH SOON LED TO AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT
OF HER WISHING VERY MUCH TO HEAR IT, AND A CONFESSION, WHICH COULD
HARDLY BE BELIEVED, OF HER HAVING NEVER YET HEARD IT SINCE ITS BEING
IN MANSFIELD. TO FANNY HERSELF IT APPEARED A VERY SIMPLE AND NATURAL
CIRCUMSTANCE. SHE HAD SCARCELY EVER BEEN AT THE PARSONAGE SINCE THE
INSTRUMENT'S ARRIVAL, THERE HAD BEEN NO REASON THAT SHE SHOULD; BUT MISS
CRAWFORD, CALLING TO MIND AN EARLY EXPRESSED WISH ON THE SUBJECT, WAS
CONCERNED AT HER OWN NEGLECT; AND "SHALL I PLAY TO YOU NOW?" AND "WHAT
WILL YOU HAVE?" WERE QUESTIONS IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING WITH THE READIEST
GOOD-HUMOUR.

SHE PLAYED ACCORDINGLY; HAPPY TO HAVE A NEW LISTENER, AND A LISTENER WHO
SEEMED SO MUCH OBLIGED, SO FULL OF WONDER AT THE PERFORMANCE, AND WHO
SHEWED HERSELF NOT WANTING IN TASTE. SHE PLAYED TILL FANNY'S EYES,
STRAYING TO THE WINDOW ON THE WEATHER'S BEING EVIDENTLY FAIR, SPOKE WHAT
SHE FELT MUST BE DONE.

"ANOTHER QUARTER OF AN HOUR," SAID MISS CRAWFORD, "AND WE SHALL SEE HOW
IT WILL BE. DO NOT RUN AWAY THE FIRST MOMENT OF ITS HOLDING UP. THOSE
CLOUDS LOOK ALARMING."

"BUT THEY ARE PASSED OVER," SAID FANNY. "I HAVE BEEN WATCHING THEM. THIS
WEATHER IS ALL FROM THE SOUTH."

"SOUTH OR NORTH, I KNOW A BLACK CLOUD WHEN I SEE IT; AND YOU MUST NOT
SET FORWARD WHILE IT IS SO THREATENING. AND BESIDES, I WANT TO PLAY
SOMETHING MORE TO YOU--A VERY PRETTY PIECE--AND YOUR COUSIN EDMUND'S
PRIME FAVOURITE. YOU MUST STAY AND HEAR YOUR COUSIN'S FAVOURITE."

FANNY FELT THAT SHE MUST; AND THOUGH SHE HAD NOT WAITED FOR THAT
SENTENCE TO BE THINKING OF EDMUND, SUCH A MEMENTO MADE HER PARTICULARLY
AWAKE TO HIS IDEA, AND SHE FANCIED HIM SITTING IN THAT ROOM AGAIN
AND AGAIN, PERHAPS IN THE VERY SPOT WHERE SHE SAT NOW, LISTENING WITH
CONSTANT DELIGHT TO THE FAVOURITE AIR, PLAYED, AS IT APPEARED TO HER,
WITH SUPERIOR TONE AND EXPRESSION; AND THOUGH PLEASED WITH IT HERSELF,
AND GLAD TO LIKE WHATEVER WAS LIKED BY HIM, SHE WAS MORE SINCERELY
IMPATIENT TO GO AWAY AT THE CONCLUSION OF IT THAN SHE HAD BEEN BEFORE;
AND ON THIS BEING EVIDENT, SHE WAS SO KINDLY ASKED TO CALL AGAIN, TO
TAKE THEM IN HER WALK WHENEVER SHE COULD, TO COME AND HEAR MORE OF THE
HARP, THAT SHE FELT IT NECESSARY TO BE DONE, IF NO OBJECTION AROSE AT
HOME.

SUCH WAS THE ORIGIN OF THE SORT OF INTIMACY WHICH TOOK PLACE BETWEEN
THEM WITHIN THE FIRST FORTNIGHT AFTER THE MISS BERTRAMS' GOING AWAY--AN
INTIMACY RESULTING PRINCIPALLY FROM MISS CRAWFORD'S DESIRE OF SOMETHING
NEW, AND WHICH HAD LITTLE REALITY IN FANNY'S FEELINGS. FANNY WENT TO HER
EVERY TWO OR THREE DAYS: IT SEEMED A KIND OF FASCINATION: SHE COULD NOT
BE EASY WITHOUT GOING, AND YET IT WAS WITHOUT LOVING HER, WITHOUT EVER
THINKING LIKE HER, WITHOUT ANY SENSE OF OBLIGATION FOR BEING SOUGHT
AFTER NOW WHEN NOBODY ELSE WAS TO BE HAD; AND DERIVING NO HIGHER
PLEASURE FROM HER CONVERSATION THAN OCCASIONAL AMUSEMENT, AND THAT
OFTEN AT THE EXPENSE OF HER JUDGMENT, WHEN IT WAS RAISED BY PLEASANTRY
ON PEOPLE OR SUBJECTS WHICH SHE WISHED TO BE RESPECTED. SHE WENT,
HOWEVER, AND THEY SAUNTERED ABOUT TOGETHER MANY AN HALF-HOUR IN MRS.
GRANT'S SHRUBBERY, THE WEATHER BEING UNUSUALLY MILD FOR THE TIME OF
YEAR, AND VENTURING SOMETIMES EVEN TO SIT DOWN ON ONE OF THE BENCHES NOW
COMPARATIVELY UNSHELTERED, REMAINING THERE PERHAPS TILL, IN THE MIDST
OF SOME TENDER EJACULATION OF FANNY'S ON THE SWEETS OF SO PROTRACTED
AN AUTUMN, THEY WERE FORCED, BY THE SUDDEN SWELL OF A COLD GUST SHAKING
DOWN THE LAST FEW YELLOW LEAVES ABOUT THEM, TO JUMP UP AND WALK FOR
WARMTH.

"THIS IS PRETTY, VERY PRETTY," SAID FANNY, LOOKING AROUND HER AS
THEY WERE THUS SITTING TOGETHER ONE DAY; "EVERY TIME I COME INTO THIS
SHRUBBERY I AM MORE STRUCK WITH ITS GROWTH AND BEAUTY. THREE YEARS AGO,
THIS WAS NOTHING BUT A ROUGH HEDGEROW ALONG THE UPPER SIDE OF THE FIELD,
NEVER THOUGHT OF AS ANYTHING, OR CAPABLE OF BECOMING ANYTHING; AND NOW
IT IS CONVERTED INTO A WALK, AND IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO SAY WHETHER
MOST VALUABLE AS A CONVENIENCE OR AN ORNAMENT; AND PERHAPS, IN ANOTHER
THREE YEARS, WE MAY BE FORGETTING--ALMOST FORGETTING WHAT IT WAS BEFORE.
HOW WONDERFUL, HOW VERY WONDERFUL THE OPERATIONS OF TIME, AND THE
CHANGES OF THE HUMAN MIND!" AND FOLLOWING THE LATTER TRAIN OF THOUGHT,
SHE SOON AFTERWARDS ADDED: "IF ANY ONE FACULTY OF OUR NATURE MAY BE
CALLED MORE WONDERFUL THAN THE REST, I DO THINK IT IS MEMORY. THERE
SEEMS SOMETHING MORE SPEAKINGLY INCOMPREHENSIBLE IN THE POWERS,
THE FAILURES, THE INEQUALITIES OF MEMORY, THAN IN ANY OTHER OF OUR
INTELLIGENCES. THE MEMORY IS SOMETIMES SO RETENTIVE, SO SERVICEABLE, SO
OBEDIENT; AT OTHERS, SO BEWILDERED AND SO WEAK; AND AT OTHERS AGAIN, SO
TYRANNIC, SO BEYOND CONTROL! WE ARE, TO BE SURE, A MIRACLE EVERY WAY;
BUT OUR POWERS OF RECOLLECTING AND OF FORGETTING DO SEEM PECULIARLY PAST
FINDING OUT."

MISS CRAWFORD, UNTOUCHED AND INATTENTIVE, HAD NOTHING TO SAY; AND
FANNY, PERCEIVING IT, BROUGHT BACK HER OWN MIND TO WHAT SHE THOUGHT MUST
INTEREST.

"IT MAY SEEM IMPERTINENT IN ME TO PRAISE, BUT I MUST ADMIRE THE TASTE
MRS. GRANT HAS SHEWN IN ALL THIS. THERE IS SUCH A QUIET SIMPLICITY IN
THE PLAN OF THE WALK! NOT TOO MUCH ATTEMPTED!"

"YES," REPLIED MISS CRAWFORD CARELESSLY, "IT DOES VERY WELL FOR A
PLACE OF THIS SORT. ONE DOES NOT THINK OF EXTENT HERE; AND BETWEEN
OURSELVES, TILL I CAME TO MANSFIELD, I HAD NOT IMAGINED A COUNTRY PARSON
EVER ASPIRED TO A SHRUBBERY, OR ANYTHING OF THE KIND."

"I AM SO GLAD TO SEE THE EVERGREENS THRIVE!" SAID FANNY, IN REPLY. "MY
UNCLE'S GARDENER ALWAYS SAYS THE SOIL HERE IS BETTER THAN HIS OWN, AND
SO IT APPEARS FROM THE GROWTH OF THE LAURELS AND EVERGREENS IN GENERAL.
THE EVERGREEN! HOW BEAUTIFUL, HOW WELCOME, HOW WONDERFUL THE EVERGREEN!
WHEN ONE THINKS OF IT, HOW ASTONISHING A VARIETY OF NATURE! IN SOME
COUNTRIES WE KNOW THE TREE THAT SHEDS ITS LEAF IS THE VARIETY, BUT THAT
DOES NOT MAKE IT LESS AMAZING THAT THE SAME SOIL AND THE SAME SUN SHOULD
NURTURE PLANTS DIFFERING IN THE FIRST RULE AND LAW OF THEIR EXISTENCE.
YOU WILL THINK ME RHAPSODISING; BUT WHEN I AM OUT OF DOORS, ESPECIALLY
WHEN I AM SITTING OUT OF DOORS, I AM VERY APT TO GET INTO THIS SORT OF
WONDERING STRAIN. ONE CANNOT FIX ONE'S EYES ON THE COMMONEST NATURAL
PRODUCTION WITHOUT FINDING FOOD FOR A RAMBLING FANCY."

"TO SAY THE TRUTH," REPLIED MISS CRAWFORD, "I AM SOMETHING LIKE THE
FAMOUS DOGE AT THE COURT OF LEWIS XIV.; AND MAY DECLARE THAT I SEE NO
WONDER IN THIS SHRUBBERY EQUAL TO SEEING MYSELF IN IT. IF ANYBODY HAD
TOLD ME A YEAR AGO THAT THIS PLACE WOULD BE MY HOME, THAT I SHOULD BE
SPENDING MONTH AFTER MONTH HERE, AS I HAVE DONE, I CERTAINLY SHOULD
NOT HAVE BELIEVED THEM. I HAVE NOW BEEN HERE NEARLY FIVE MONTHS; AND,
MOREOVER, THE QUIETEST FIVE MONTHS I EVER PASSED."

"TOO QUIET FOR YOU, I BELIEVE."

"I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT SO THEORETICALLY MYSELF, BUT," AND HER EYES
BRIGHTENED AS SHE SPOKE, "TAKE IT ALL AND ALL, I NEVER SPENT SO HAPPY A
SUMMER. BUT THEN," WITH A MORE THOUGHTFUL AIR AND LOWERED VOICE, "THERE
IS NO SAYING WHAT IT MAY LEAD TO."

FANNY'S HEART BEAT QUICK, AND SHE FELT QUITE UNEQUAL TO SURMISING
OR SOLICITING ANYTHING MORE. MISS CRAWFORD, HOWEVER, WITH RENEWED
ANIMATION, SOON WENT ON--

"I AM CONSCIOUS OF BEING FAR BETTER RECONCILED TO A COUNTRY RESIDENCE
THAN I HAD EVER EXPECTED TO BE. I CAN EVEN SUPPOSE IT PLEASANT TO
SPEND HALF THE YEAR IN THE COUNTRY, UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES,
VERY PLEASANT. AN ELEGANT, MODERATE-SIZED HOUSE IN THE CENTRE OF FAMILY
CONNEXIONS; CONTINUAL ENGAGEMENTS AMONG THEM; COMMANDING THE FIRST
SOCIETY IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD; LOOKED UP TO, PERHAPS, AS LEADING IT EVEN
MORE THAN THOSE OF LARGER FORTUNE, AND TURNING FROM THE CHEERFUL ROUND
OF SUCH AMUSEMENTS TO NOTHING WORSE THAN A TETE-A-TETE WITH THE PERSON
ONE FEELS MOST AGREEABLE IN THE WORLD. THERE IS NOTHING FRIGHTFUL IN
SUCH A PICTURE, IS THERE, MISS PRICE? ONE NEED NOT ENVY THE NEW MRS.
RUSHWORTH WITH SUCH A HOME AS THAT."

"ENVY MRS. RUSHWORTH!" WAS ALL THAT FANNY ATTEMPTED TO SAY. "COME, COME,
IT WOULD BE VERY UN-HANDSOME IN US TO BE SEVERE ON MRS. RUSHWORTH, FOR I
LOOK FORWARD TO OUR OWING HER A GREAT MANY GAY, BRILLIANT, HAPPY HOURS.
I EXPECT WE SHALL BE ALL VERY MUCH AT SOTHERTON ANOTHER YEAR. SUCH
A MATCH AS MISS BERTRAM HAS MADE IS A PUBLIC BLESSING; FOR THE FIRST
PLEASURES OF MR. RUSHWORTH'S WIFE MUST BE TO FILL HER HOUSE, AND GIVE
THE BEST BALLS IN THE COUNTRY."

FANNY WAS SILENT, AND MISS CRAWFORD RELAPSED INTO THOUGHTFULNESS, TILL
SUDDENLY LOOKING UP AT THE END OF A FEW MINUTES, SHE EXCLAIMED, "AH!
HERE HE IS." IT WAS NOT MR. RUSHWORTH, HOWEVER, BUT EDMUND, WHO THEN
APPEARED WALKING TOWARDS THEM WITH MRS. GRANT. "MY SISTER AND MR.
BERTRAM. I AM SO GLAD YOUR ELDEST COUSIN IS GONE, THAT HE MAY BE MR.
BERTRAM AGAIN. THERE IS SOMETHING IN THE SOUND OF MR. EDMUND BERTRAM
SO FORMAL, SO PITIFUL, SO YOUNGER-BROTHER-LIKE, THAT I DETEST IT."

"HOW DIFFERENTLY WE FEEL!" CRIED FANNY. "TO ME, THE SOUND OF MR.
BERTRAM IS SO COLD AND NOTHING-MEANING, SO ENTIRELY WITHOUT WARMTH OR
CHARACTER! IT JUST STANDS FOR A GENTLEMAN, AND THAT'S ALL. BUT THERE IS
NOBLENESS IN THE NAME OF EDMUND. IT IS A NAME OF HEROISM AND RENOWN; OF
KINGS, PRINCES, AND KNIGHTS; AND SEEMS TO BREATHE THE SPIRIT OF CHIVALRY
AND WARM AFFECTIONS."

"I GRANT YOU THE NAME IS GOOD IN ITSELF, AND LORD EDMUND OR SIR
EDMUND SOUND DELIGHTFULLY; BUT SINK IT UNDER THE CHILL, THE ANNIHILATION
OF A MR., AND MR. EDMUND IS NO MORE THAN MR. JOHN OR MR. THOMAS. WELL,
SHALL WE JOIN AND DISAPPOINT THEM OF HALF THEIR LECTURE UPON SITTING
DOWN OUT OF DOORS AT THIS TIME OF YEAR, BY BEING UP BEFORE THEY CAN
BEGIN?"

EDMUND MET THEM WITH PARTICULAR PLEASURE. IT WAS THE FIRST TIME OF HIS
SEEING THEM TOGETHER SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THAT BETTER ACQUAINTANCE
WHICH HE HAD BEEN HEARING OF WITH GREAT SATISFACTION. A FRIENDSHIP
BETWEEN TWO SO VERY DEAR TO HIM WAS EXACTLY WHAT HE COULD HAVE WISHED:
AND TO THE CREDIT OF THE LOVER'S UNDERSTANDING, BE IT STATED, THAT HE
DID NOT BY ANY MEANS CONSIDER FANNY AS THE ONLY, OR EVEN AS THE GREATER
GAINER BY SUCH A FRIENDSHIP.

"WELL," SAID MISS CRAWFORD, "AND DO YOU NOT SCOLD US FOR OUR IMPRUDENCE?
WHAT DO YOU THINK WE HAVE BEEN SITTING DOWN FOR BUT TO BE TALKED TO
ABOUT IT, AND ENTREATED AND SUPPLICATED NEVER TO DO SO AGAIN?"

"PERHAPS I MIGHT HAVE SCOLDED," SAID EDMUND, "IF EITHER OF YOU HAD BEEN
SITTING DOWN ALONE; BUT WHILE YOU DO WRONG TOGETHER, I CAN OVERLOOK A
GREAT DEAL."

"THEY CANNOT HAVE BEEN SITTING LONG," CRIED MRS. GRANT, "FOR WHEN I WENT
UP FOR MY SHAWL I SAW THEM FROM THE STAIRCASE WINDOW, AND THEN THEY WERE
WALKING."

"AND REALLY," ADDED EDMUND, "THE DAY IS SO MILD, THAT YOUR SITTING DOWN
FOR A FEW MINUTES CAN BE HARDLY THOUGHT IMPRUDENT. OUR WEATHER MUST
NOT ALWAYS BE JUDGED BY THE CALENDAR. WE MAY SOMETIMES TAKE GREATER
LIBERTIES IN NOVEMBER THAN IN MAY."

"UPON MY WORD," CRIED MISS CRAWFORD, "YOU ARE TWO OF THE MOST
DISAPPOINTING AND UNFEELING KIND FRIENDS I EVER MET WITH! THERE IS NO
GIVING YOU A MOMENT'S UNEASINESS. YOU DO NOT KNOW HOW MUCH WE HAVE BEEN
SUFFERING, NOR WHAT CHILLS WE HAVE FELT! BUT I HAVE LONG THOUGHT MR.
BERTRAM ONE OF THE WORST SUBJECTS TO WORK ON, IN ANY LITTLE MANOEUVRE
AGAINST COMMON SENSE, THAT A WOMAN COULD BE PLAGUED WITH. I HAD VERY
LITTLE HOPE OF HIM FROM THE FIRST; BUT YOU, MRS. GRANT, MY SISTER, MY
OWN SISTER, I THINK I HAD A RIGHT TO ALARM YOU A LITTLE."

"DO NOT FLATTER YOURSELF, MY DEAREST MARY. YOU HAVE NOT THE SMALLEST
CHANCE OF MOVING ME. I HAVE MY ALARMS, BUT THEY ARE QUITE IN A DIFFERENT
QUARTER; AND IF I COULD HAVE ALTERED THE WEATHER, YOU WOULD HAVE HAD A
GOOD SHARP EAST WIND BLOWING ON YOU THE WHOLE TIME--FOR HERE ARE SOME OF
MY PLANTS WHICH ROBERT WILL LEAVE OUT BECAUSE THE NIGHTS ARE SO MILD,
AND I KNOW THE END OF IT WILL BE, THAT WE SHALL HAVE A SUDDEN CHANGE OF
WEATHER, A HARD FROST SETTING IN ALL AT ONCE, TAKING EVERYBODY (AT LEAST
ROBERT) BY SURPRISE, AND I SHALL LOSE EVERY ONE; AND WHAT IS WORSE, COOK
HAS JUST BEEN TELLING ME THAT THE TURKEY, WHICH I PARTICULARLY WISHED
NOT TO BE DRESSED TILL SUNDAY, BECAUSE I KNOW HOW MUCH MORE DR. GRANT
WOULD ENJOY IT ON SUNDAY AFTER THE FATIGUES OF THE DAY, WILL NOT KEEP
BEYOND TO-MORROW. THESE ARE SOMETHING LIKE GRIEVANCES, AND MAKE ME THINK
THE WEATHER MOST UNSEASONABLY CLOSE."

"THE SWEETS OF HOUSEKEEPING IN A COUNTRY VILLAGE!" SAID MISS CRAWFORD
ARCHLY. "COMMEND ME TO THE NURSERYMAN AND THE POULTERER."

"MY DEAR CHILD, COMMEND DR. GRANT TO THE DEANERY OF WESTMINSTER OR ST.
PAUL'S, AND I SHOULD BE AS GLAD OF YOUR NURSERYMAN AND POULTERER AS YOU
COULD BE. BUT WE HAVE NO SUCH PEOPLE IN MANSFIELD. WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE
ME DO?"

"OH! YOU CAN DO NOTHING BUT WHAT YOU DO ALREADY: BE PLAGUED VERY OFTEN,
AND NEVER LOSE YOUR TEMPER."

"THANK YOU; BUT THERE IS NO ESCAPING THESE LITTLE VEXATIONS, MARY, LIVE
WHERE WE MAY; AND WHEN YOU ARE SETTLED IN TOWN AND I COME TO SEE YOU, I
DARE SAY I SHALL FIND YOU WITH YOURS, IN SPITE OF THE NURSERYMAN AND
THE POULTERER, PERHAPS ON THEIR VERY ACCOUNT. THEIR REMOTENESS AND
UNPUNCTUALITY, OR THEIR EXORBITANT CHARGES AND FRAUDS, WILL BE DRAWING
FORTH BITTER LAMENTATIONS."

"I MEAN TO BE TOO RICH TO LAMENT OR TO FEEL ANYTHING OF THE SORT.
A LARGE INCOME IS THE BEST RECIPE FOR HAPPINESS I EVER HEARD OF. IT
CERTAINLY MAY SECURE ALL THE MYRTLE AND TURKEY PART OF IT."

"YOU INTEND TO BE VERY RICH?" SAID EDMUND, WITH A LOOK WHICH, TO FANNY'S
EYE, HAD A GREAT DEAL OF SERIOUS MEANING.

"TO BE SURE. DO NOT YOU? DO NOT WE ALL?"

"I CANNOT INTEND ANYTHING WHICH IT MUST BE SO COMPLETELY BEYOND MY POWER
TO COMMAND. MISS CRAWFORD MAY CHUSE HER DEGREE OF WEALTH. SHE HAS ONLY
TO FIX ON HER NUMBER OF THOUSANDS A YEAR, AND THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT OF
THEIR COMING. MY INTENTIONS ARE ONLY NOT TO BE POOR."

"BY MODERATION AND ECONOMY, AND BRINGING DOWN YOUR WANTS TO YOUR INCOME,
AND ALL THAT. I UNDERSTAND YOU--AND A VERY PROPER PLAN IT IS FOR A
PERSON AT YOUR TIME OF LIFE, WITH SUCH LIMITED MEANS AND INDIFFERENT
CONNEXIONS. WHAT CAN YOU WANT BUT A DECENT MAINTENANCE? YOU HAVE
NOT MUCH TIME BEFORE YOU; AND YOUR RELATIONS ARE IN NO SITUATION TO DO
ANYTHING FOR YOU, OR TO MORTIFY YOU BY THE CONTRAST OF THEIR OWN WEALTH
AND CONSEQUENCE. BE HONEST AND POOR, BY ALL MEANS--BUT I SHALL NOT ENVY
YOU; I DO NOT MUCH THINK I SHALL EVEN RESPECT YOU. I HAVE A MUCH GREATER
RESPECT FOR THOSE THAT ARE HONEST AND RICH."

"YOUR DEGREE OF RESPECT FOR HONESTY, RICH OR POOR, IS PRECISELY WHAT
I HAVE NO MANNER OF CONCERN WITH. I DO NOT MEAN TO BE POOR. POVERTY
IS EXACTLY WHAT I HAVE DETERMINED AGAINST. HONESTY, IN THE SOMETHING
BETWEEN, IN THE MIDDLE STATE OF WORLDLY CIRCUMSTANCES, IS ALL THAT I AM
ANXIOUS FOR YOUR NOT LOOKING DOWN ON."

"BUT I DO LOOK DOWN UPON IT, IF IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN HIGHER. I MUST
LOOK DOWN UPON ANYTHING CONTENTED WITH OBSCURITY WHEN IT MIGHT RISE TO
DISTINCTION."

"BUT HOW MAY IT RISE? HOW MAY MY HONESTY AT LEAST RISE TO ANY
DISTINCTION?"

THIS WAS NOT SO VERY EASY A QUESTION TO ANSWER, AND OCCASIONED AN "OH!"
OF SOME LENGTH FROM THE FAIR LADY BEFORE SHE COULD ADD, "YOU OUGHT TO BE
IN PARLIAMENT, OR YOU SHOULD HAVE GONE INTO THE ARMY TEN YEARS AGO."

"THAT IS NOT MUCH TO THE PURPOSE NOW; AND AS TO MY BEING IN
PARLIAMENT, I BELIEVE I MUST WAIT TILL THERE IS AN ESPECIAL ASSEMBLY FOR
THE REPRESENTATION OF YOUNGER SONS WHO HAVE LITTLE TO LIVE ON. NO, MISS
CRAWFORD," HE ADDED, IN A MORE SERIOUS TONE, "THERE ARE DISTINCTIONS
WHICH I SHOULD BE MISERABLE IF I THOUGHT MYSELF WITHOUT ANY
CHANCE--ABSOLUTELY WITHOUT CHANCE OR POSSIBILITY OF OBTAINING--BUT THEY
ARE OF A DIFFERENT CHARACTER."

A LOOK OF CONSCIOUSNESS AS HE SPOKE, AND WHAT SEEMED A CONSCIOUSNESS
OF MANNER ON MISS CRAWFORD'S SIDE AS SHE MADE SOME LAUGHING ANSWER,
WAS SORROWFULL FOOD FOR FANNY'S OBSERVATION; AND FINDING HERSELF QUITE
UNABLE TO ATTEND AS SHE OUGHT TO MRS. GRANT, BY WHOSE SIDE SHE WAS NOW
FOLLOWING THE OTHERS, SHE HAD NEARLY RESOLVED ON GOING HOME IMMEDIATELY,
AND ONLY WAITED FOR COURAGE TO SAY SO, WHEN THE SOUND OF THE GREAT CLOCK
AT MANSFIELD PARK, STRIKING THREE, MADE HER FEEL THAT SHE HAD
REALLY BEEN MUCH LONGER ABSENT THAN USUAL, AND BROUGHT THE PREVIOUS
SELF-INQUIRY OF WHETHER SHE SHOULD TAKE LEAVE OR NOT JUST THEN, AND HOW,
TO A VERY SPEEDY ISSUE. WITH UNDOUBTING DECISION SHE DIRECTLY BEGAN HER
ADIEUS; AND EDMUND BEGAN AT THE SAME TIME TO RECOLLECT THAT HIS MOTHER
HAD BEEN INQUIRING FOR HER, AND THAT HE HAD WALKED DOWN TO THE PARSONAGE
ON PURPOSE TO BRING HER BACK.

FANNY'S HURRY INCREASED; AND WITHOUT IN THE LEAST EXPECTING EDMUND'S
ATTENDANCE, SHE WOULD HAVE HASTENED AWAY ALONE; BUT THE GENERAL PACE WAS
QUICKENED, AND THEY ALL ACCOMPANIED HER INTO THE HOUSE, THROUGH WHICH IT
WAS NECESSARY TO PASS. DR. GRANT WAS IN THE VESTIBULE, AND AS THEY STOPT
TO SPEAK TO HIM SHE FOUND, FROM EDMUND'S MANNER, THAT HE DID MEAN TO
GO WITH HER. HE TOO WAS TAKING LEAVE. SHE COULD NOT BUT BE THANKFUL. IN
THE MOMENT OF PARTING, EDMUND WAS INVITED BY DR. GRANT TO EAT HIS MUTTON
WITH HIM THE NEXT DAY; AND FANNY HAD BARELY TIME FOR AN UNPLEASANT
FEELING ON THE OCCASION, WHEN MRS. GRANT, WITH SUDDEN RECOLLECTION,
TURNED TO HER AND ASKED FOR THE PLEASURE OF HER COMPANY TOO. THIS WAS
SO NEW AN ATTENTION, SO PERFECTLY NEW A CIRCUMSTANCE IN THE EVENTS OF
FANNY'S LIFE, THAT SHE WAS ALL SURPRISE AND EMBARRASSMENT; AND WHILE
STAMMERING OUT HER GREAT OBLIGATION, AND HER "BUT SHE DID NOT SUPPOSE IT
WOULD BE IN HER POWER," WAS LOOKING AT EDMUND FOR HIS OPINION AND HELP.
BUT EDMUND, DELIGHTED WITH HER HAVING SUCH AN HAPPINESS OFFERED, AND
ASCERTAINING WITH HALF A LOOK, AND HALF A SENTENCE, THAT SHE HAD NO
OBJECTION BUT ON HER AUNT'S ACCOUNT, COULD NOT IMAGINE THAT HIS MOTHER
WOULD MAKE ANY DIFFICULTY OF SPARING HER, AND THEREFORE GAVE HIS DECIDED
OPEN ADVICE THAT THE INVITATION SHOULD BE ACCEPTED; AND THOUGH FANNY
WOULD NOT VENTURE, EVEN ON HIS ENCOURAGEMENT, TO SUCH A FLIGHT OF
AUDACIOUS INDEPENDENCE, IT WAS SOON SETTLED, THAT IF NOTHING WERE HEARD
TO THE CONTRARY, MRS. GRANT MIGHT EXPECT HER.

"AND YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR DINNER WILL BE," SAID MRS. GRANT, SMILING--"THE
TURKEY, AND I ASSURE YOU A VERY FINE ONE; FOR, MY DEAR," TURNING TO HER
HUSBAND, "COOK INSISTS UPON THE TURKEY'S BEING DRESSED TO-MORROW."

"VERY WELL, VERY WELL," CRIED DR. GRANT, "ALL THE BETTER; I AM GLAD
TO HEAR YOU HAVE ANYTHING SO GOOD IN THE HOUSE. BUT MISS PRICE AND MR.
EDMUND BERTRAM, I DARE SAY, WOULD TAKE THEIR CHANCE. WE NONE OF US WANT
TO HEAR THE BILL OF FARE. A FRIENDLY MEETING, AND NOT A FINE DINNER,
IS ALL WE HAVE IN VIEW. A TURKEY, OR A GOOSE, OR A LEG OF MUTTON, OR
WHATEVER YOU AND YOUR COOK CHUSE TO GIVE US."

THE TWO COUSINS WALKED HOME TOGETHER; AND, EXCEPT IN THE IMMEDIATE
DISCUSSION OF THIS ENGAGEMENT, WHICH EDMUND SPOKE OF WITH THE WARMEST
SATISFACTION, AS SO PARTICULARLY DESIRABLE FOR HER IN THE INTIMACY WHICH
HE SAW WITH SO MUCH PLEASURE ESTABLISHED, IT WAS A SILENT WALK; FOR
HAVING FINISHED THAT SUBJECT, HE GREW THOUGHTFUL AND INDISPOSED FOR ANY
OTHER.



CHAPTER XXIII

"BUT WHY SHOULD MRS. GRANT ASK FANNY?" SAID LADY BERTRAM. "HOW CAME SHE
TO THINK OF ASKING FANNY? FANNY NEVER DINES THERE, YOU KNOW, IN THIS
SORT OF WAY. I CANNOT SPARE HER, AND I AM SURE SHE DOES NOT WANT TO GO.
FANNY, YOU DO NOT WANT TO GO, DO YOU?"

"IF YOU PUT SUCH A QUESTION TO HER," CRIED EDMUND, PREVENTING HIS
COUSIN'S SPEAKING, "FANNY WILL IMMEDIATELY SAY NO; BUT I AM SURE, MY
DEAR MOTHER, SHE WOULD LIKE TO GO; AND I CAN SEE NO REASON WHY SHE
SHOULD NOT."

"I CANNOT IMAGINE WHY MRS. GRANT SHOULD THINK OF ASKING HER? SHE NEVER
DID BEFORE. SHE USED TO ASK YOUR SISTERS NOW AND THEN, BUT SHE NEVER
ASKED FANNY."

"IF YOU CANNOT DO WITHOUT ME, MA'AM--" SAID FANNY, IN A SELF-DENYING
TONE.

"BUT MY MOTHER WILL HAVE MY FATHER WITH HER ALL THE EVENING."

"TO BE SURE, SO I SHALL."

"SUPPOSE YOU TAKE MY FATHER'S OPINION, MA'AM."

"THAT'S WELL THOUGHT OF. SO I WILL, EDMUND. I WILL ASK SIR THOMAS, AS
SOON AS HE COMES IN, WHETHER I CAN DO WITHOUT HER."

"AS YOU PLEASE, MA'AM, ON THAT HEAD; BUT I MEANT MY FATHER'S OPINION
AS TO THE PROPRIETY OF THE INVITATION'S BEING ACCEPTED OR NOT; AND
I THINK HE WILL CONSIDER IT A RIGHT THING BY MRS. GRANT, AS WELL AS BY
FANNY, THAT BEING THE FIRST INVITATION IT SHOULD BE ACCEPTED."

"I DO NOT KNOW. WE WILL ASK HIM. BUT HE WILL BE VERY MUCH SURPRISED THAT
MRS. GRANT SHOULD ASK FANNY AT ALL."

THERE WAS NOTHING MORE TO BE SAID, OR THAT COULD BE SAID TO ANY PURPOSE,
TILL SIR THOMAS WERE PRESENT; BUT THE SUBJECT INVOLVING, AS IT DID,
HER OWN EVENING'S COMFORT FOR THE MORROW, WAS SO MUCH UPPERMOST IN LADY
BERTRAM'S MIND, THAT HALF AN HOUR AFTERWARDS, ON HIS LOOKING IN FOR A
MINUTE IN HIS WAY FROM HIS PLANTATION TO HIS DRESSING-ROOM, SHE CALLED
HIM BACK AGAIN, WHEN HE HAD ALMOST CLOSED THE DOOR, WITH "SIR THOMAS,
STOP A MOMENT--I HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY TO YOU."

HER TONE OF CALM LANGUOR, FOR SHE NEVER TOOK THE TROUBLE OF RAISING HER
VOICE, WAS ALWAYS HEARD AND ATTENDED TO; AND SIR THOMAS CAME BACK. HER
STORY BEGAN; AND FANNY IMMEDIATELY SLIPPED OUT OF THE ROOM; FOR TO HEAR
HERSELF THE SUBJECT OF ANY DISCUSSION WITH HER UNCLE WAS MORE THAN HER
NERVES COULD BEAR. SHE WAS ANXIOUS, SHE KNEW--MORE ANXIOUS PERHAPS THAN
SHE OUGHT TO BE--FOR WHAT WAS IT AFTER ALL WHETHER SHE WENT OR STAID?
BUT IF HER UNCLE WERE TO BE A GREAT WHILE CONSIDERING AND DECIDING, AND
WITH VERY GRAVE LOOKS, AND THOSE GRAVE LOOKS DIRECTED TO HER, AND
AT LAST DECIDE AGAINST HER, SHE MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO APPEAR PROPERLY
SUBMISSIVE AND INDIFFERENT. HER CAUSE, MEANWHILE, WENT ON WELL. IT
BEGAN, ON LADY BERTRAM'S PART, WITH--"I HAVE SOMETHING TO TELL YOU THAT
WILL SURPRISE YOU. MRS. GRANT HAS ASKED FANNY TO DINNER."

"WELL," SAID SIR THOMAS, AS IF WAITING MORE TO ACCOMPLISH THE SURPRISE.

"EDMUND WANTS HER TO GO. BUT HOW CAN I SPARE HER?"

"SHE WILL BE LATE," SAID SIR THOMAS, TAKING OUT HIS WATCH; "BUT WHAT IS
YOUR DIFFICULTY?"

EDMUND FOUND HIMSELF OBLIGED TO SPEAK AND FILL UP THE BLANKS IN HIS
MOTHER'S STORY. HE TOLD THE WHOLE; AND SHE HAD ONLY TO ADD, "SO STRANGE!
FOR MRS. GRANT NEVER USED TO ASK HER."

"BUT IS IT NOT VERY NATURAL," OBSERVED EDMUND, "THAT MRS. GRANT SHOULD
WISH TO PROCURE SO AGREEABLE A VISITOR FOR HER SISTER?"

"NOTHING CAN BE MORE NATURAL," SAID SIR THOMAS, AFTER A SHORT
DELIBERATION; "NOR, WERE THERE NO SISTER IN THE CASE, COULD ANYTHING,
IN MY OPINION, BE MORE NATURAL. MRS. GRANT'S SHEWING CIVILITY TO MISS
PRICE, TO LADY BERTRAM'S NIECE, COULD NEVER WANT EXPLANATION. THE ONLY
SURPRISE I CAN FEEL IS, THAT THIS SHOULD BE THE FIRST TIME OF ITS
BEING PAID. FANNY WAS PERFECTLY RIGHT IN GIVING ONLY A CONDITIONAL
ANSWER. SHE APPEARS TO FEEL AS SHE OUGHT. BUT AS I CONCLUDE THAT SHE
MUST WISH TO GO, SINCE ALL YOUNG PEOPLE LIKE TO BE TOGETHER, I CAN SEE
NO REASON WHY SHE SHOULD BE DENIED THE INDULGENCE."

"BUT CAN I DO WITHOUT HER, SIR THOMAS?"

"INDEED I THINK YOU MAY."

"SHE ALWAYS MAKES TEA, YOU KNOW, WHEN MY SISTER IS NOT HERE."

"YOUR SISTER, PERHAPS, MAY BE PREVAILED ON TO SPEND THE DAY WITH US, AND
I SHALL CERTAINLY BE AT HOME."

"VERY WELL, THEN, FANNY MAY GO, EDMUND."

THE GOOD NEWS SOON FOLLOWED HER. EDMUND KNOCKED AT HER DOOR IN HIS WAY
TO HIS OWN.

"WELL, FANNY, IT IS ALL HAPPILY SETTLED, AND WITHOUT THE SMALLEST
HESITATION ON YOUR UNCLE'S SIDE. HE HAD BUT ONE OPINION. YOU ARE TO GO."

"THANK YOU, I AM SO GLAD," WAS FANNY'S INSTINCTIVE REPLY; THOUGH WHEN
SHE HAD TURNED FROM HIM AND SHUT THE DOOR, SHE COULD NOT HELP FEELING,
"AND YET WHY SHOULD I BE GLAD? FOR AM I NOT CERTAIN OF SEEING OR HEARING
SOMETHING THERE TO PAIN ME?"

IN SPITE OF THIS CONVICTION, HOWEVER, SHE WAS GLAD. SIMPLE AS SUCH AN
ENGAGEMENT MIGHT APPEAR IN OTHER EYES, IT HAD NOVELTY AND IMPORTANCE IN
HERS, FOR EXCEPTING THE DAY AT SOTHERTON, SHE HAD SCARCELY EVER DINED
OUT BEFORE; AND THOUGH NOW GOING ONLY HALF A MILE, AND ONLY TO THREE
PEOPLE, STILL IT WAS DINING OUT, AND ALL THE LITTLE INTERESTS OF
PREPARATION WERE ENJOYMENTS IN THEMSELVES. SHE HAD NEITHER SYMPATHY NOR
ASSISTANCE FROM THOSE WHO OUGHT TO HAVE ENTERED INTO HER FEELINGS AND
DIRECTED HER TASTE; FOR LADY BERTRAM NEVER THOUGHT OF BEING USEFUL TO
ANYBODY, AND MRS. NORRIS, WHEN SHE CAME ON THE MORROW, IN CONSEQUENCE OF
AN EARLY CALL AND INVITATION FROM SIR THOMAS, WAS IN A VERY ILL HUMOUR,
AND SEEMED INTENT ONLY ON LESSENING HER NIECE'S PLEASURE, BOTH PRESENT
AND FUTURE, AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.

"UPON MY WORD, FANNY, YOU ARE IN HIGH LUCK TO MEET WITH SUCH ATTENTION
AND INDULGENCE! YOU OUGHT TO BE VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO MRS. GRANT FOR
THINKING OF YOU, AND TO YOUR AUNT FOR LETTING YOU GO, AND YOU OUGHT TO
LOOK UPON IT AS SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY; FOR I HOPE YOU ARE AWARE THAT
THERE IS NO REAL OCCASION FOR YOUR GOING INTO COMPANY IN THIS SORT OF
WAY, OR EVER DINING OUT AT ALL; AND IT IS WHAT YOU MUST NOT DEPEND UPON
EVER BEING REPEATED. NOR MUST YOU BE FANCYING THAT THE INVITATION IS
MEANT AS ANY PARTICULAR COMPLIMENT TO YOU; THE COMPLIMENT IS INTENDED
TO YOUR UNCLE AND AUNT AND ME. MRS. GRANT THINKS IT A CIVILITY DUE TO
US TO TAKE A LITTLE NOTICE OF YOU, OR ELSE IT WOULD NEVER HAVE COME
INTO HER HEAD, AND YOU MAY BE VERY CERTAIN THAT, IF YOUR COUSIN JULIA
HAD BEEN AT HOME, YOU WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ASKED AT ALL."

MRS. NORRIS HAD NOW SO INGENIOUSLY DONE AWAY ALL MRS. GRANT'S PART OF
THE FAVOUR, THAT FANNY, WHO FOUND HERSELF EXPECTED TO SPEAK, COULD ONLY
SAY THAT SHE WAS VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO HER AUNT BERTRAM FOR SPARING HER,
AND THAT SHE WAS ENDEAVOURING TO PUT HER AUNT'S EVENING WORK IN SUCH A
STATE AS TO PREVENT HER BEING MISSED.

"OH! DEPEND UPON IT, YOUR AUNT CAN DO VERY WELL WITHOUT YOU, OR YOU
WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO GO. I SHALL BE HERE, SO YOU MAY BE QUITE EASY
ABOUT YOUR AUNT. AND I HOPE YOU WILL HAVE A VERY AGREEABLE DAY, AND
FIND IT ALL MIGHTY DELIGHTFUL. BUT I MUST OBSERVE THAT FIVE IS THE
VERY AWKWARDEST OF ALL POSSIBLE NUMBERS TO SIT DOWN TO TABLE; AND I
CANNOT BUT BE SURPRISED THAT SUCH AN ELEGANT LADY AS MRS. GRANT SHOULD
NOT CONTRIVE BETTER! AND ROUND THEIR ENORMOUS GREAT WIDE TABLE, TOO,
WHICH FILLS UP THE ROOM SO DREADFULLY! HAD THE DOCTOR BEEN CONTENTED TO
TAKE MY DINING-TABLE WHEN I CAME AWAY, AS ANYBODY IN THEIR SENSES WOULD
HAVE DONE, INSTEAD OF HAVING THAT ABSURD NEW ONE OF HIS OWN, WHICH IS
WIDER, LITERALLY WIDER THAN THE DINNER-TABLE HERE, HOW INFINITELY BETTER
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN! AND HOW MUCH MORE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN RESPECTED! FOR
PEOPLE ARE NEVER RESPECTED WHEN THEY STEP OUT OF THEIR PROPER SPHERE.
REMEMBER THAT, FANNY. FIVE--ONLY FIVE TO BE SITTING ROUND THAT TABLE.
HOWEVER, YOU WILL HAVE DINNER ENOUGH ON IT FOR TEN, I DARE SAY."

MRS. NORRIS FETCHED BREATH, AND WENT ON AGAIN.

"THE NONSENSE AND FOLLY OF PEOPLE'S STEPPING OUT OF THEIR RANK AND
TRYING TO APPEAR ABOVE THEMSELVES, MAKES ME THINK IT RIGHT TO GIVE YOU
A HINT, FANNY, NOW THAT YOU ARE GOING INTO COMPANY WITHOUT ANY OF US;
AND I DO BESEECH AND ENTREAT YOU NOT TO BE PUTTING YOURSELF FORWARD, AND
TALKING AND GIVING YOUR OPINION AS IF YOU WERE ONE OF YOUR COUSINS--AS
IF YOU WERE DEAR MRS. RUSHWORTH OR JULIA. THAT WILL NEVER DO, BELIEVE
ME. REMEMBER, WHEREVER YOU ARE, YOU MUST BE THE LOWEST AND LAST; AND
THOUGH MISS CRAWFORD IS IN A MANNER AT HOME AT THE PARSONAGE, YOU ARE
NOT TO BE TAKING PLACE OF HER. AND AS TO COMING AWAY AT NIGHT, YOU ARE
TO STAY JUST AS LONG AS EDMUND CHUSES. LEAVE HIM TO SETTLE THAT."

"YES, MA'AM, I SHOULD NOT THINK OF ANYTHING ELSE."

"AND IF IT SHOULD RAIN, WHICH I THINK EXCEEDINGLY LIKELY, FOR I NEVER
SAW IT MORE THREATENING FOR A WET EVENING IN MY LIFE, YOU MUST MANAGE AS
WELL AS YOU CAN, AND NOT BE EXPECTING THE CARRIAGE TO BE SENT FOR YOU. I
CERTAINLY DO NOT GO HOME TO-NIGHT, AND, THEREFORE, THE CARRIAGE WILL NOT
BE OUT ON MY ACCOUNT; SO YOU MUST MAKE UP YOUR MIND TO WHAT MAY HAPPEN,
AND TAKE YOUR THINGS ACCORDINGLY."

HER NIECE THOUGHT IT PERFECTLY REASONABLE. SHE RATED HER OWN CLAIMS
TO COMFORT AS LOW EVEN AS MRS. NORRIS COULD; AND WHEN SIR THOMAS SOON
AFTERWARDS, JUST OPENING THE DOOR, SAID, "FANNY, AT WHAT TIME WOULD YOU
HAVE THE CARRIAGE COME ROUND?" SHE FELT A DEGREE OF ASTONISHMENT WHICH
MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR HER TO SPEAK.

"MY DEAR SIR THOMAS!" CRIED MRS. NORRIS, RED WITH ANGER, "FANNY CAN
WALK."

"WALK!" REPEATED SIR THOMAS, IN A TONE OF MOST UNANSWERABLE DIGNITY, AND
COMING FARTHER INTO THE ROOM. "MY NIECE WALK TO A DINNER ENGAGEMENT AT
THIS TIME OF THE YEAR! WILL TWENTY MINUTES AFTER FOUR SUIT YOU?"

"YES, SIR," WAS FANNY'S HUMBLE ANSWER, GIVEN WITH THE FEELINGS ALMOST
OF A CRIMINAL TOWARDS MRS. NORRIS; AND NOT BEARING TO REMAIN WITH HER
IN WHAT MIGHT SEEM A STATE OF TRIUMPH, SHE FOLLOWED HER UNCLE OUT OF
THE ROOM, HAVING STAID BEHIND HIM ONLY LONG ENOUGH TO HEAR THESE WORDS
SPOKEN IN ANGRY AGITATION--

"QUITE UNNECESSARY! A GREAT DEAL TOO KIND! BUT EDMUND GOES; TRUE, IT IS
UPON EDMUND'S ACCOUNT. I OBSERVED HE WAS HOARSE ON THURSDAY NIGHT."

BUT THIS COULD NOT IMPOSE ON FANNY. SHE FELT THAT THE CARRIAGE WAS FOR
HERSELF, AND HERSELF ALONE: AND HER UNCLE'S CONSIDERATION OF HER, COMING
IMMEDIATELY AFTER SUCH REPRESENTATIONS FROM HER AUNT, COST HER SOME
TEARS OF GRATITUDE WHEN SHE WAS ALONE.

THE COACHMAN DROVE ROUND TO A MINUTE; ANOTHER MINUTE BROUGHT DOWN THE
GENTLEMAN; AND AS THE LADY HAD, WITH A MOST SCRUPULOUS FEAR OF BEING
LATE, BEEN MANY MINUTES SEATED IN THE DRAWING-ROOM, SIR THOMAS SAW THEM
OFF IN AS GOOD TIME AS HIS OWN CORRECTLY PUNCTUAL HABITS REQUIRED.

"NOW I MUST LOOK AT YOU, FANNY," SAID EDMUND, WITH THE KIND SMILE OF AN
AFFECTIONATE BROTHER, "AND TELL YOU HOW I LIKE YOU; AND AS WELL AS I CAN
JUDGE BY THIS LIGHT, YOU LOOK VERY NICELY INDEED. WHAT HAVE YOU GOT ON?"

"THE NEW DRESS THAT MY UNCLE WAS SO GOOD AS TO GIVE ME ON MY COUSIN'S
MARRIAGE. I HOPE IT IS NOT TOO FINE; BUT I THOUGHT I OUGHT TO WEAR IT AS
SOON AS I COULD, AND THAT I MIGHT NOT HAVE SUCH ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY ALL
THE WINTER. I HOPE YOU DO NOT THINK ME TOO FINE."

"A WOMAN CAN NEVER BE TOO FINE WHILE SHE IS ALL IN WHITE. NO, I SEE NO
FINERY ABOUT YOU; NOTHING BUT WHAT IS PERFECTLY PROPER. YOUR GOWN SEEMS
VERY PRETTY. I LIKE THESE GLOSSY SPOTS. HAS NOT MISS CRAWFORD A GOWN
SOMETHING THE SAME?"

IN APPROACHING THE PARSONAGE THEY PASSED CLOSE BY THE STABLE-YARD AND
COACH-HOUSE.

"HEYDAY!" SAID EDMUND, "HERE'S COMPANY, HERE'S A CARRIAGE! WHO HAVE THEY
GOT TO MEET US?" AND LETTING DOWN THE SIDE-GLASS TO DISTINGUISH, "'TIS
CRAWFORD'S, CRAWFORD'S BAROUCHE, I PROTEST! THERE ARE HIS OWN TWO MEN
PUSHING IT BACK INTO ITS OLD QUARTERS. HE IS HERE, OF COURSE. THIS IS
QUITE A SURPRISE, FANNY. I SHALL BE VERY GLAD TO SEE HIM."

THERE WAS NO OCCASION, THERE WAS NO TIME FOR FANNY TO SAY HOW VERY
DIFFERENTLY SHE FELT; BUT THE IDEA OF HAVING SUCH ANOTHER TO OBSERVE
HER WAS A GREAT INCREASE OF THE TREPIDATION WITH WHICH SHE PERFORMED THE
VERY AWFUL CEREMONY OF WALKING INTO THE DRAWING-ROOM.

IN THE DRAWING-ROOM MR. CRAWFORD CERTAINLY WAS, HAVING BEEN JUST LONG
ENOUGH ARRIVED TO BE READY FOR DINNER; AND THE SMILES AND PLEASED LOOKS
OF THE THREE OTHERS STANDING ROUND HIM, SHEWED HOW WELCOME WAS HIS
SUDDEN RESOLUTION OF COMING TO THEM FOR A FEW DAYS ON LEAVING BATH.
A VERY CORDIAL MEETING PASSED BETWEEN HIM AND EDMUND; AND WITH THE
EXCEPTION OF FANNY, THE PLEASURE WAS GENERAL; AND EVEN TO HER THERE
MIGHT BE SOME ADVANTAGE IN HIS PRESENCE, SINCE EVERY ADDITION TO THE
PARTY MUST RATHER FORWARD HER FAVOURITE INDULGENCE OF BEING SUFFERED TO
SIT SILENT AND UNATTENDED TO. SHE WAS SOON AWARE OF THIS HERSELF; FOR
THOUGH SHE MUST SUBMIT, AS HER OWN PROPRIETY OF MIND DIRECTED, IN SPITE
OF HER AUNT NORRIS'S OPINION, TO BEING THE PRINCIPAL LADY IN COMPANY,
AND TO ALL THE LITTLE DISTINCTIONS CONSEQUENT THEREON, SHE FOUND, WHILE
THEY WERE AT TABLE, SUCH A HAPPY FLOW OF CONVERSATION PREVAILING, IN
WHICH SHE WAS NOT REQUIRED TO TAKE ANY PART--THERE WAS SO MUCH TO BE
SAID BETWEEN THE BROTHER AND SISTER ABOUT BATH, SO MUCH BETWEEN THE TWO
YOUNG MEN ABOUT HUNTING, SO MUCH OF POLITICS BETWEEN MR. CRAWFORD AND
DR. GRANT, AND OF EVERYTHING AND ALL TOGETHER BETWEEN MR. CRAWFORD
AND MRS. GRANT, AS TO LEAVE HER THE FAIREST PROSPECT OF HAVING ONLY
TO LISTEN IN QUIET, AND OF PASSING A VERY AGREEABLE DAY. SHE COULD NOT
COMPLIMENT THE NEWLY ARRIVED GENTLEMAN, HOWEVER, WITH ANY APPEARANCE OF
INTEREST, IN A SCHEME FOR EXTENDING HIS STAY AT MANSFIELD, AND SENDING
FOR HIS HUNTERS FROM NORFOLK, WHICH, SUGGESTED BY DR. GRANT, ADVISED BY
EDMUND, AND WARMLY URGED BY THE TWO SISTERS, WAS SOON IN POSSESSION OF
HIS MIND, AND WHICH HE SEEMED TO WANT TO BE ENCOURAGED EVEN BY HER TO
RESOLVE ON. HER OPINION WAS SOUGHT AS TO THE PROBABLE CONTINUANCE OF THE
OPEN WEATHER, BUT HER ANSWERS WERE AS SHORT AND INDIFFERENT AS CIVILITY
ALLOWED. SHE COULD NOT WISH HIM TO STAY, AND WOULD MUCH RATHER NOT HAVE
HIM SPEAK TO HER.

HER TWO ABSENT COUSINS, ESPECIALLY MARIA, WERE MUCH IN HER THOUGHTS ON
SEEING HIM; BUT NO EMBARRASSING REMEMBRANCE AFFECTED HIS SPIRITS.
HERE HE WAS AGAIN ON THE SAME GROUND WHERE ALL HAD PASSED BEFORE, AND
APPARENTLY AS WILLING TO STAY AND BE HAPPY WITHOUT THE MISS BERTRAMS,
AS IF HE HAD NEVER KNOWN MANSFIELD IN ANY OTHER STATE. SHE HEARD THEM
SPOKEN OF BY HIM ONLY IN A GENERAL WAY, TILL THEY WERE ALL RE-ASSEMBLED
IN THE DRAWING-ROOM, WHEN EDMUND, BEING ENGAGED APART IN SOME MATTER OF
BUSINESS WITH DR. GRANT, WHICH SEEMED ENTIRELY TO ENGROSS THEM, AND
MRS. GRANT OCCUPIED AT THE TEA-TABLE, HE BEGAN TALKING OF THEM WITH MORE
PARTICULARITY TO HIS OTHER SISTER. WITH A SIGNIFICANT SMILE, WHICH MADE
FANNY QUITE HATE HIM, HE SAID, "SO! RUSHWORTH AND HIS FAIR BRIDE ARE AT
BRIGHTON, I UNDERSTAND; HAPPY MAN!"

"YES, THEY HAVE BEEN THERE ABOUT A FORTNIGHT, MISS PRICE, HAVE THEY NOT?
AND JULIA IS WITH THEM."

"AND MR. YATES, I PRESUME, IS NOT FAR OFF."

"MR. YATES! OH! WE HEAR NOTHING OF MR. YATES. I DO NOT IMAGINE HE
FIGURES MUCH IN THE LETTERS TO MANSFIELD PARK; DO YOU, MISS PRICE? I
THINK MY FRIEND JULIA KNOWS BETTER THAN TO ENTERTAIN HER FATHER WITH MR.
YATES."

"POOR RUSHWORTH AND HIS TWO-AND-FORTY SPEECHES!" CONTINUED CRAWFORD.
"NOBODY CAN EVER FORGET THEM. POOR FELLOW! I SEE HIM NOW--HIS TOIL AND
HIS DESPAIR. WELL, I AM MUCH MISTAKEN IF HIS LOVELY MARIA WILL EVER WANT
HIM TO MAKE TWO-AND-FORTY SPEECHES TO HER"; ADDING, WITH A MOMENTARY
SERIOUSNESS, "SHE IS TOO GOOD FOR HIM--MUCH TOO GOOD." AND THEN CHANGING
HIS TONE AGAIN TO ONE OF GENTLE GALLANTRY, AND ADDRESSING FANNY, HE
SAID, "YOU WERE MR. RUSHWORTH'S BEST FRIEND. YOUR KINDNESS AND PATIENCE
CAN NEVER BE FORGOTTEN, YOUR INDEFATIGABLE PATIENCE IN TRYING TO MAKE IT
POSSIBLE FOR HIM TO LEARN HIS PART--IN TRYING TO GIVE HIM A BRAIN
WHICH NATURE HAD DENIED--TO MIX UP AN UNDERSTANDING FOR HIM OUT OF THE
SUPERFLUITY OF YOUR OWN! HE MIGHT NOT HAVE SENSE ENOUGH HIMSELF TO
ESTIMATE YOUR KINDNESS, BUT I MAY VENTURE TO SAY THAT IT HAD HONOUR FROM
ALL THE REST OF THE PARTY."

FANNY COLOURED, AND SAID NOTHING.

"IT IS AS A DREAM, A PLEASANT DREAM!" HE EXCLAIMED, BREAKING FORTH
AGAIN, AFTER A FEW MINUTES' MUSING. "I SHALL ALWAYS LOOK BACK ON OUR
THEATRICALS WITH EXQUISITE PLEASURE. THERE WAS SUCH AN INTEREST, SUCH AN
ANIMATION, SUCH A SPIRIT DIFFUSED. EVERYBODY FELT IT. WE WERE ALL ALIVE.
THERE WAS EMPLOYMENT, HOPE, SOLICITUDE, BUSTLE, FOR EVERY HOUR OF
THE DAY. ALWAYS SOME LITTLE OBJECTION, SOME LITTLE DOUBT, SOME LITTLE
ANXIETY TO BE GOT OVER. I NEVER WAS HAPPIER."

WITH SILENT INDIGNATION FANNY REPEATED TO HERSELF, "NEVER
HAPPIER!--NEVER HAPPIER THAN WHEN DOING WHAT YOU MUST KNOW WAS NOT
JUSTIFIABLE!--NEVER HAPPIER THAN WHEN BEHAVING SO DISHONOURABLY AND
UNFEELINGLY! OH! WHAT A CORRUPTED MIND!"

"WE WERE UNLUCKY, MISS PRICE," HE CONTINUED, IN A LOWER TONE, TO AVOID
THE POSSIBILITY OF BEING HEARD BY EDMUND, AND NOT AT ALL AWARE OF HER
FEELINGS, "WE CERTAINLY WERE VERY UNLUCKY. ANOTHER WEEK, ONLY ONE OTHER
WEEK, WOULD HAVE BEEN ENOUGH FOR US. I THINK IF WE HAD HAD THE DISPOSAL
OF EVENTS--IF MANSFIELD PARK HAD HAD THE GOVERNMENT OF THE WINDS
JUST FOR A WEEK OR TWO, ABOUT THE EQUINOX, THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN
A DIFFERENCE. NOT THAT WE WOULD HAVE ENDANGERED HIS SAFETY BY ANY
TREMENDOUS WEATHER--BUT ONLY BY A STEADY CONTRARY WIND, OR A CALM. I
THINK, MISS PRICE, WE WOULD HAVE INDULGED OURSELVES WITH A WEEK'S CALM
IN THE ATLANTIC AT THAT SEASON."

HE SEEMED DETERMINED TO BE ANSWERED; AND FANNY, AVERTING HER FACE, SAID,
WITH A FIRMER TONE THAN USUAL, "AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED, SIR, I WOULD
NOT HAVE DELAYED HIS RETURN FOR A DAY. MY UNCLE DISAPPROVED IT ALL SO
ENTIRELY WHEN HE DID ARRIVE, THAT IN MY OPINION EVERYTHING HAD GONE
QUITE FAR ENOUGH."

SHE HAD NEVER SPOKEN SO MUCH AT ONCE TO HIM IN HER LIFE BEFORE, AND
NEVER SO ANGRILY TO ANY ONE; AND WHEN HER SPEECH WAS OVER, SHE TREMBLED
AND BLUSHED AT HER OWN DARING. HE WAS SURPRISED; BUT AFTER A FEW
MOMENTS' SILENT CONSIDERATION OF HER, REPLIED IN A CALMER, GRAVER TONE,
AND AS IF THE CANDID RESULT OF CONVICTION, "I BELIEVE YOU ARE RIGHT.
IT WAS MORE PLEASANT THAN PRUDENT. WE WERE GETTING TOO NOISY." AND
THEN TURNING THE CONVERSATION, HE WOULD HAVE ENGAGED HER ON SOME OTHER
SUBJECT, BUT HER ANSWERS WERE SO SHY AND RELUCTANT THAT HE COULD NOT
ADVANCE IN ANY.

MISS CRAWFORD, WHO HAD BEEN REPEATEDLY EYEING DR. GRANT AND EDMUND,
NOW OBSERVED, "THOSE GENTLEMEN MUST HAVE SOME VERY INTERESTING POINT TO
DISCUSS."

"THE MOST INTERESTING IN THE WORLD," REPLIED HER BROTHER--"HOW TO MAKE
MONEY; HOW TO TURN A GOOD INCOME INTO A BETTER. DR. GRANT IS GIVING
BERTRAM INSTRUCTIONS ABOUT THE LIVING HE IS TO STEP INTO SO SOON. I FIND
HE TAKES ORDERS IN A FEW WEEKS. THEY WERE AT IT IN THE DINING-PARLOUR. I
AM GLAD TO HEAR BERTRAM WILL BE SO WELL OFF. HE WILL HAVE A VERY PRETTY
INCOME TO MAKE DUCKS AND DRAKES WITH, AND EARNED WITHOUT MUCH TROUBLE. I
APPREHEND HE WILL NOT HAVE LESS THAN SEVEN HUNDRED A YEAR. SEVEN HUNDRED
A YEAR IS A FINE THING FOR A YOUNGER BROTHER; AND AS OF COURSE HE WILL
STILL LIVE AT HOME, IT WILL BE ALL FOR HIS MENUS PLAISIRS; AND A
SERMON AT CHRISTMAS AND EASTER, I SUPPOSE, WILL BE THE SUM TOTAL OF
SACRIFICE."

HIS SISTER TRIED TO LAUGH OFF HER FEELINGS BY SAYING, "NOTHING AMUSES ME
MORE THAN THE EASY MANNER WITH WHICH EVERYBODY SETTLES THE ABUNDANCE OF
THOSE WHO HAVE A GREAT DEAL LESS THAN THEMSELVES. YOU WOULD LOOK RATHER
BLANK, HENRY, IF YOUR MENUS PLAISIRS WERE TO BE LIMITED TO SEVEN
HUNDRED A YEAR."

"PERHAPS I MIGHT; BUT ALL THAT YOU KNOW IS ENTIRELY COMPARATIVE.
BIRTHRIGHT AND HABIT MUST SETTLE THE BUSINESS. BERTRAM IS CERTAINLY WELL
OFF FOR A CADET OF EVEN A BARONET'S FAMILY. BY THE TIME HE IS FOUR OR
FIVE AND TWENTY HE WILL HAVE SEVEN HUNDRED A YEAR, AND NOTHING TO DO FOR
IT."

MISS CRAWFORD COULD HAVE SAID THAT THERE WOULD BE A SOMETHING TO DO
AND TO SUFFER FOR IT, WHICH SHE COULD NOT THINK LIGHTLY OF; BUT SHE
CHECKED HERSELF AND LET IT PASS; AND TRIED TO LOOK CALM AND UNCONCERNED
WHEN THE TWO GENTLEMEN SHORTLY AFTERWARDS JOINED THEM.

"BERTRAM," SAID HENRY CRAWFORD, "I SHALL MAKE A POINT OF COMING TO
MANSFIELD TO HEAR YOU PREACH YOUR FIRST SERMON. I SHALL COME ON PURPOSE
TO ENCOURAGE A YOUNG BEGINNER. WHEN IS IT TO BE? MISS PRICE, WILL NOT
YOU JOIN ME IN ENCOURAGING YOUR COUSIN? WILL NOT YOU ENGAGE TO ATTEND
WITH YOUR EYES STEADILY FIXED ON HIM THE WHOLE TIME--AS I SHALL DO--NOT
TO LOSE A WORD; OR ONLY LOOKING OFF JUST TO NOTE DOWN ANY SENTENCE
PREEMINENTLY BEAUTIFUL? WE WILL PROVIDE OURSELVES WITH TABLETS AND A
PENCIL. WHEN WILL IT BE? YOU MUST PREACH AT MANSFIELD, YOU KNOW, THAT
SIR THOMAS AND LADY BERTRAM MAY HEAR YOU."

"I SHALL KEEP CLEAR OF YOU, CRAWFORD, AS LONG AS I CAN," SAID EDMUND;
"FOR YOU WOULD BE MORE LIKELY TO DISCONCERT ME, AND I SHOULD BE MORE
SORRY TO SEE YOU TRYING AT IT THAN ALMOST ANY OTHER MAN."

"WILL HE NOT FEEL THIS?" THOUGHT FANNY. "NO, HE CAN FEEL NOTHING AS HE
OUGHT."

THE PARTY BEING NOW ALL UNITED, AND THE CHIEF TALKERS ATTRACTING EACH
OTHER, SHE REMAINED IN TRANQUILLITY; AND AS A WHIST-TABLE WAS FORMED
AFTER TEA--FORMED REALLY FOR THE AMUSEMENT OF DR. GRANT, BY HIS
ATTENTIVE WIFE, THOUGH IT WAS NOT TO BE SUPPOSED SO--AND MISS CRAWFORD
TOOK HER HARP, SHE HAD NOTHING TO DO BUT TO LISTEN; AND HER TRANQUILLITY
REMAINED UNDISTURBED THE REST OF THE EVENING, EXCEPT WHEN MR. CRAWFORD
NOW AND THEN ADDRESSED TO HER A QUESTION OR OBSERVATION, WHICH SHE COULD
NOT AVOID ANSWERING. MISS CRAWFORD WAS TOO MUCH VEXED BY WHAT HAD PASSED
TO BE IN A HUMOUR FOR ANYTHING BUT MUSIC. WITH THAT SHE SOOTHED HERSELF
AND AMUSED HER FRIEND.

THE ASSURANCE OF EDMUND'S BEING SO SOON TO TAKE ORDERS, COMING UPON HER
LIKE A BLOW THAT HAD BEEN SUSPENDED, AND STILL HOPED UNCERTAIN AND AT A
DISTANCE, WAS FELT WITH RESENTMENT AND MORTIFICATION. SHE WAS VERY ANGRY
WITH HIM. SHE HAD THOUGHT HER INFLUENCE MORE. SHE HAD BEGUN TO THINK
OF HIM; SHE FELT THAT SHE HAD, WITH GREAT REGARD, WITH ALMOST DECIDED
INTENTIONS; BUT SHE WOULD NOW MEET HIM WITH HIS OWN COOL FEELINGS. IT
WAS PLAIN THAT HE COULD HAVE NO SERIOUS VIEWS, NO TRUE ATTACHMENT, BY
FIXING HIMSELF IN A SITUATION WHICH HE MUST KNOW SHE WOULD NEVER
STOOP TO. SHE WOULD LEARN TO MATCH HIM IN HIS INDIFFERENCE. SHE WOULD
HENCEFORTH ADMIT HIS ATTENTIONS WITHOUT ANY IDEA BEYOND IMMEDIATE
AMUSEMENT. IF HE COULD SO COMMAND HIS AFFECTIONS, HERS SHOULD DO HER
NO HARM.



CHAPTER XXIV

HENRY CRAWFORD HAD QUITE MADE UP HIS MIND BY THE NEXT MORNING TO GIVE
ANOTHER FORTNIGHT TO MANSFIELD, AND HAVING SENT FOR HIS HUNTERS, AND
WRITTEN A FEW LINES OF EXPLANATION TO THE ADMIRAL, HE LOOKED ROUND AT
HIS SISTER AS HE SEALED AND THREW THE LETTER FROM HIM, AND SEEING THE
COAST CLEAR OF THE REST OF THE FAMILY, SAID, WITH A SMILE, "AND HOW DO
YOU THINK I MEAN TO AMUSE MYSELF, MARY, ON THE DAYS THAT I DO NOT HUNT?
I AM GROWN TOO OLD TO GO OUT MORE THAN THREE TIMES A WEEK; BUT I HAVE A
PLAN FOR THE INTERMEDIATE DAYS, AND WHAT DO YOU THINK IT IS?"

"TO WALK AND RIDE WITH ME, TO BE SURE."

"NOT EXACTLY, THOUGH I SHALL BE HAPPY TO DO BOTH, BUT THAT WOULD BE
EXERCISE ONLY TO MY BODY, AND I MUST TAKE CARE OF MY MIND. BESIDES,
THAT WOULD BE ALL RECREATION AND INDULGENCE, WITHOUT THE WHOLESOME
ALLOY OF LABOUR, AND I DO NOT LIKE TO EAT THE BREAD OF IDLENESS. NO, MY
PLAN IS TO MAKE FANNY PRICE IN LOVE WITH ME."

"FANNY PRICE! NONSENSE! NO, NO. YOU OUGHT TO BE SATISFIED WITH HER TWO
COUSINS."

"BUT I CANNOT BE SATISFIED WITHOUT FANNY PRICE, WITHOUT MAKING A SMALL
HOLE IN FANNY PRICE'S HEART. YOU DO NOT SEEM PROPERLY AWARE OF HER
CLAIMS TO NOTICE. WHEN WE TALKED OF HER LAST NIGHT, YOU NONE OF YOU
SEEMED SENSIBLE OF THE WONDERFUL IMPROVEMENT THAT HAS TAKEN PLACE IN HER
LOOKS WITHIN THE LAST SIX WEEKS. YOU SEE HER EVERY DAY, AND THEREFORE DO
NOT NOTICE IT; BUT I ASSURE YOU SHE IS QUITE A DIFFERENT CREATURE FROM
WHAT SHE WAS IN THE AUTUMN. SHE WAS THEN MERELY A QUIET, MODEST, NOT
PLAIN-LOOKING GIRL, BUT SHE IS NOW ABSOLUTELY PRETTY. I USED TO THINK
SHE HAD NEITHER COMPLEXION NOR COUNTENANCE; BUT IN THAT SOFT SKIN OF
HERS, SO FREQUENTLY TINGED WITH A BLUSH AS IT WAS YESTERDAY, THERE IS
DECIDED BEAUTY; AND FROM WHAT I OBSERVED OF HER EYES AND MOUTH, I DO
NOT DESPAIR OF THEIR BEING CAPABLE OF EXPRESSION ENOUGH WHEN SHE
HAS ANYTHING TO EXPRESS. AND THEN, HER AIR, HER MANNER, HER TOUT
ENSEMBLE, IS SO INDESCRIBABLY IMPROVED! SHE MUST BE GROWN TWO INCHES,
AT LEAST, SINCE OCTOBER."

"PHOO! PHOO! THIS IS ONLY BECAUSE THERE WERE NO TALL WOMEN TO COMPARE
HER WITH, AND BECAUSE SHE HAS GOT A NEW GOWN, AND YOU NEVER SAW HER SO
WELL DRESSED BEFORE. SHE IS JUST WHAT SHE WAS IN OCTOBER, BELIEVE ME.
THE TRUTH IS, THAT SHE WAS THE ONLY GIRL IN COMPANY FOR YOU TO NOTICE,
AND YOU MUST HAVE A SOMEBODY. I HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT HER PRETTY--NOT
STRIKINGLY PRETTY--BUT 'PRETTY ENOUGH,' AS PEOPLE SAY; A SORT OF BEAUTY
THAT GROWS ON ONE. HER EYES SHOULD BE DARKER, BUT SHE HAS A SWEET SMILE;
BUT AS FOR THIS WONDERFUL DEGREE OF IMPROVEMENT, I AM SURE IT MAY ALL
BE RESOLVED INTO A BETTER STYLE OF DRESS, AND YOUR HAVING NOBODY ELSE TO
LOOK AT; AND THEREFORE, IF YOU DO SET ABOUT A FLIRTATION WITH HER, YOU
NEVER WILL PERSUADE ME THAT IT IS IN COMPLIMENT TO HER BEAUTY, OR THAT
IT PROCEEDS FROM ANYTHING BUT YOUR OWN IDLENESS AND FOLLY."

HER BROTHER GAVE ONLY A SMILE TO THIS ACCUSATION, AND SOON AFTERWARDS
SAID, "I DO NOT QUITE KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF MISS FANNY. I DO NOT
UNDERSTAND HER. I COULD NOT TELL WHAT SHE WOULD BE AT YESTERDAY. WHAT IS
HER CHARACTER? IS SHE SOLEMN? IS SHE QUEER? IS SHE PRUDISH? WHY DID SHE
DRAW BACK AND LOOK SO GRAVE AT ME? I COULD HARDLY GET HER TO SPEAK. I
NEVER WAS SO LONG IN COMPANY WITH A GIRL IN MY LIFE, TRYING TO ENTERTAIN
HER, AND SUCCEED SO ILL! NEVER MET WITH A GIRL WHO LOOKED SO GRAVE ON
ME! I MUST TRY TO GET THE BETTER OF THIS. HER LOOKS SAY, 'I WILL NOT
LIKE YOU, I AM DETERMINED NOT TO LIKE YOU'; AND I SAY SHE SHALL."

"FOOLISH FELLOW! AND SO THIS IS HER ATTRACTION AFTER ALL! THIS IT IS,
HER NOT CARING ABOUT YOU, WHICH GIVES HER SUCH A SOFT SKIN, AND MAKES
HER SO MUCH TALLER, AND PRODUCES ALL THESE CHARMS AND GRACES! I DO
DESIRE THAT YOU WILL NOT BE MAKING HER REALLY UNHAPPY; A LITTLE LOVE,
PERHAPS, MAY ANIMATE AND DO HER GOOD, BUT I WILL NOT HAVE YOU PLUNGE
HER DEEP, FOR SHE IS AS GOOD A LITTLE CREATURE AS EVER LIVED, AND HAS A
GREAT DEAL OF FEELING."

"IT CAN BE BUT FOR A FORTNIGHT," SAID HENRY; "AND IF A FORTNIGHT CAN
KILL HER, SHE MUST HAVE A CONSTITUTION WHICH NOTHING COULD SAVE. NO, I
WILL NOT DO HER ANY HARM, DEAR LITTLE SOUL! ONLY WANT HER TO LOOK KINDLY
ON ME, TO GIVE ME SMILES AS WELL AS BLUSHES, TO KEEP A CHAIR FOR ME BY
HERSELF WHEREVER WE ARE, AND BE ALL ANIMATION WHEN I TAKE IT AND TALK
TO HER; TO THINK AS I THINK, BE INTERESTED IN ALL MY POSSESSIONS AND
PLEASURES, TRY TO KEEP ME LONGER AT MANSFIELD, AND FEEL WHEN I GO AWAY
THAT SHE SHALL BE NEVER HAPPY AGAIN. I WANT NOTHING MORE."

"MODERATION ITSELF!" SAID MARY. "I CAN HAVE NO SCRUPLES NOW. WELL, YOU
WILL HAVE OPPORTUNITIES ENOUGH OF ENDEAVOURING TO RECOMMEND YOURSELF,
FOR WE ARE A GREAT DEAL TOGETHER."

AND WITHOUT ATTEMPTING ANY FARTHER REMONSTRANCE, SHE LEFT FANNY TO
HER FATE, A FATE WHICH, HAD NOT FANNY'S HEART BEEN GUARDED IN A WAY
UNSUSPECTED BY MISS CRAWFORD, MIGHT HAVE BEEN A LITTLE HARDER THAN SHE
DESERVED; FOR ALTHOUGH THERE DOUBTLESS ARE SUCH UNCONQUERABLE YOUNG
LADIES OF EIGHTEEN (OR ONE SHOULD NOT READ ABOUT THEM) AS ARE NEVER
TO BE PERSUADED INTO LOVE AGAINST THEIR JUDGMENT BY ALL THAT TALENT,
MANNER, ATTENTION, AND FLATTERY CAN DO, I HAVE NO INCLINATION TO
BELIEVE FANNY ONE OF THEM, OR TO THINK THAT WITH SO MUCH TENDERNESS
OF DISPOSITION, AND SO MUCH TASTE AS BELONGED TO HER, SHE COULD HAVE
ESCAPED HEART-WHOLE FROM THE COURTSHIP (THOUGH THE COURTSHIP ONLY OF
A FORTNIGHT) OF SUCH A MAN AS CRAWFORD, IN SPITE OF THERE BEING SOME
PREVIOUS ILL OPINION OF HIM TO BE OVERCOME, HAD NOT HER AFFECTION BEEN
ENGAGED ELSEWHERE. WITH ALL THE SECURITY WHICH LOVE OF ANOTHER AND
DISESTEEM OF HIM COULD GIVE TO THE PEACE OF MIND HE WAS ATTACKING,
HIS CONTINUED ATTENTIONS--CONTINUED, BUT NOT OBTRUSIVE, AND ADAPTING
THEMSELVES MORE AND MORE TO THE GENTLENESS AND DELICACY OF HER
CHARACTER--OBLIGED HER VERY SOON TO DISLIKE HIM LESS THAN FORMERLY. SHE
HAD BY NO MEANS FORGOTTEN THE PAST, AND SHE THOUGHT AS ILL OF HIM AS
EVER; BUT SHE FELT HIS POWERS: HE WAS ENTERTAINING; AND HIS MANNERS WERE
SO IMPROVED, SO POLITE, SO SERIOUSLY AND BLAMELESSLY POLITE, THAT IT WAS
IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO BE CIVIL TO HIM IN RETURN.

A VERY FEW DAYS WERE ENOUGH TO EFFECT THIS; AND AT THE END OF THOSE FEW
DAYS, CIRCUMSTANCES AROSE WHICH HAD A TENDENCY RATHER TO FORWARD HIS
VIEWS OF PLEASING HER, INASMUCH AS THEY GAVE HER A DEGREE OF HAPPINESS
WHICH MUST DISPOSE HER TO BE PLEASED WITH EVERYBODY. WILLIAM, HER
BROTHER, THE SO LONG ABSENT AND DEARLY LOVED BROTHER, WAS IN ENGLAND
AGAIN. SHE HAD A LETTER FROM HIM HERSELF, A FEW HURRIED HAPPY LINES,
WRITTEN AS THE SHIP CAME UP CHANNEL, AND SENT INTO PORTSMOUTH WITH
THE FIRST BOAT THAT LEFT THE ANTWERP AT ANCHOR IN SPITHEAD; AND WHEN
CRAWFORD WALKED UP WITH THE NEWSPAPER IN HIS HAND, WHICH HE HAD HOPED
WOULD BRING THE FIRST TIDINGS, HE FOUND HER TREMBLING WITH JOY OVER THIS
LETTER, AND LISTENING WITH A GLOWING, GRATEFUL COUNTENANCE TO THE KIND
INVITATION WHICH HER UNCLE WAS MOST COLLECTEDLY DICTATING IN REPLY.

IT WAS BUT THE DAY BEFORE THAT CRAWFORD HAD MADE HIMSELF THOROUGHLY
MASTER OF THE SUBJECT, OR HAD IN FACT BECOME AT ALL AWARE OF HER HAVING
SUCH A BROTHER, OR HIS BEING IN SUCH A SHIP, BUT THE INTEREST THEN
EXCITED HAD BEEN VERY PROPERLY LIVELY, DETERMINING HIM ON HIS RETURN TO
TOWN TO APPLY FOR INFORMATION AS TO THE PROBABLE PERIOD OF THE ANTWERP'S
RETURN FROM THE MEDITERRANEAN, ETC.; AND THE GOOD LUCK WHICH ATTENDED
HIS EARLY EXAMINATION OF SHIP NEWS THE NEXT MORNING SEEMED THE REWARD OF
HIS INGENUITY IN FINDING OUT SUCH A METHOD OF PLEASING HER, AS WELL AS
OF HIS DUTIFUL ATTENTION TO THE ADMIRAL, IN HAVING FOR MANY YEARS
TAKEN IN THE PAPER ESTEEMED TO HAVE THE EARLIEST NAVAL INTELLIGENCE. HE
PROVED, HOWEVER, TO BE TOO LATE. ALL THOSE FINE FIRST FEELINGS, OF WHICH
HE HAD HOPED TO BE THE EXCITER, WERE ALREADY GIVEN. BUT HIS INTENTION,
THE KINDNESS OF HIS INTENTION, WAS THANKFULLY ACKNOWLEDGED: QUITE
THANKFULLY AND WARMLY, FOR SHE WAS ELEVATED BEYOND THE COMMON TIMIDITY
OF HER MIND BY THE FLOW OF HER LOVE FOR WILLIAM.

THIS DEAR WILLIAM WOULD SOON BE AMONGST THEM. THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT
OF HIS OBTAINING LEAVE OF ABSENCE IMMEDIATELY, FOR HE WAS STILL ONLY A
MIDSHIPMAN; AND AS HIS PARENTS, FROM LIVING ON THE SPOT, MUST ALREADY
HAVE SEEN HIM, AND BE SEEING HIM PERHAPS DAILY, HIS DIRECT HOLIDAYS
MIGHT WITH JUSTICE BE INSTANTLY GIVEN TO THE SISTER, WHO HAD BEEN HIS
BEST CORRESPONDENT THROUGH A PERIOD OF SEVEN YEARS, AND THE UNCLE WHO
HAD DONE MOST FOR HIS SUPPORT AND ADVANCEMENT; AND ACCORDINGLY THE REPLY
TO HER REPLY, FIXING A VERY EARLY DAY FOR HIS ARRIVAL, CAME AS SOON AS
POSSIBLE; AND SCARCELY TEN DAYS HAD PASSED SINCE FANNY HAD BEEN IN
THE AGITATION OF HER FIRST DINNER-VISIT, WHEN SHE FOUND HERSELF IN AN
AGITATION OF A HIGHER NATURE, WATCHING IN THE HALL, IN THE LOBBY, ON
THE STAIRS, FOR THE FIRST SOUND OF THE CARRIAGE WHICH WAS TO BRING HER A
BROTHER.

IT CAME HAPPILY WHILE SHE WAS THUS WAITING; AND THERE BEING NEITHER
CEREMONY NOR FEARFULNESS TO DELAY THE MOMENT OF MEETING, SHE WAS WITH
HIM AS HE ENTERED THE HOUSE, AND THE FIRST MINUTES OF EXQUISITE FEELING
HAD NO INTERRUPTION AND NO WITNESSES, UNLESS THE SERVANTS CHIEFLY INTENT
UPON OPENING THE PROPER DOORS COULD BE CALLED SUCH. THIS WAS EXACTLY
WHAT SIR THOMAS AND EDMUND HAD BEEN SEPARATELY CONNIVING AT, AS EACH
PROVED TO THE OTHER BY THE SYMPATHETIC ALACRITY WITH WHICH THEY BOTH
ADVISED MRS. NORRIS'S CONTINUING WHERE SHE WAS, INSTEAD OF RUSHING OUT
INTO THE HALL AS SOON AS THE NOISES OF THE ARRIVAL REACHED THEM.

WILLIAM AND FANNY SOON SHEWED THEMSELVES; AND SIR THOMAS HAD THE
PLEASURE OF RECEIVING, IN HIS PROTEGE, CERTAINLY A VERY DIFFERENT PERSON
FROM THE ONE HE HAD EQUIPPED SEVEN YEARS AGO, BUT A YOUNG MAN OF AN
OPEN, PLEASANT COUNTENANCE, AND FRANK, UNSTUDIED, BUT FEELING AND
RESPECTFUL MANNERS, AND SUCH AS CONFIRMED HIM HIS FRIEND.

IT WAS LONG BEFORE FANNY COULD RECOVER FROM THE AGITATING HAPPINESS OF
SUCH AN HOUR AS WAS FORMED BY THE LAST THIRTY MINUTES OF EXPECTATION,
AND THE FIRST OF FRUITION; IT WAS SOME TIME EVEN BEFORE HER HAPPINESS
COULD BE SAID TO MAKE HER HAPPY, BEFORE THE DISAPPOINTMENT INSEPARABLE
FROM THE ALTERATION OF PERSON HAD VANISHED, AND SHE COULD SEE IN HIM THE
SAME WILLIAM AS BEFORE, AND TALK TO HIM, AS HER HEART HAD BEEN YEARNING
TO DO THROUGH MANY A PAST YEAR. THAT TIME, HOWEVER, DID GRADUALLY COME,
FORWARDED BY AN AFFECTION ON HIS SIDE AS WARM AS HER OWN, AND MUCH LESS
ENCUMBERED BY REFINEMENT OR SELF-DISTRUST. SHE WAS THE FIRST OBJECT
OF HIS LOVE, BUT IT WAS A LOVE WHICH HIS STRONGER SPIRITS, AND BOLDER
TEMPER, MADE IT AS NATURAL FOR HIM TO EXPRESS AS TO FEEL. ON THE
MORROW THEY WERE WALKING ABOUT TOGETHER WITH TRUE ENJOYMENT, AND EVERY
SUCCEEDING MORROW RENEWED A TETE-A-TETE WHICH SIR THOMAS COULD NOT BUT
OBSERVE WITH COMPLACENCY, EVEN BEFORE EDMUND HAD POINTED IT OUT TO HIM.

EXCEPTING THE MOMENTS OF PECULIAR DELIGHT, WHICH ANY MARKED OR
UNLOOKED-FOR INSTANCE OF EDMUND'S CONSIDERATION OF HER IN THE LAST FEW
MONTHS HAD EXCITED, FANNY HAD NEVER KNOWN SO MUCH FELICITY IN HER LIFE,
AS IN THIS UNCHECKED, EQUAL, FEARLESS INTERCOURSE WITH THE BROTHER AND
FRIEND WHO WAS OPENING ALL HIS HEART TO HER, TELLING HER ALL HIS HOPES
AND FEARS, PLANS, AND SOLICITUDES RESPECTING THAT LONG THOUGHT OF,
DEARLY EARNED, AND JUSTLY VALUED BLESSING OF PROMOTION; WHO COULD GIVE
HER DIRECT AND MINUTE INFORMATION OF THE FATHER AND MOTHER, BROTHERS AND
SISTERS, OF WHOM SHE VERY SELDOM HEARD; WHO WAS INTERESTED IN ALL THE
COMFORTS AND ALL THE LITTLE HARDSHIPS OF HER HOME AT MANSFIELD; READY TO
THINK OF EVERY MEMBER OF THAT HOME AS SHE DIRECTED, OR DIFFERING ONLY
BY A LESS SCRUPULOUS OPINION, AND MORE NOISY ABUSE OF THEIR AUNT NORRIS,
AND WITH WHOM (PERHAPS THE DEAREST INDULGENCE OF THE WHOLE) ALL THE EVIL
AND GOOD OF THEIR EARLIEST YEARS COULD BE GONE OVER AGAIN, AND EVERY
FORMER UNITED PAIN AND PLEASURE RETRACED WITH THE FONDEST RECOLLECTION.
AN ADVANTAGE THIS, A STRENGTHENER OF LOVE, IN WHICH EVEN THE CONJUGAL
TIE IS BENEATH THE FRATERNAL. CHILDREN OF THE SAME FAMILY, THE SAME
BLOOD, WITH THE SAME FIRST ASSOCIATIONS AND HABITS, HAVE SOME MEANS OF
ENJOYMENT IN THEIR POWER, WHICH NO SUBSEQUENT CONNEXIONS CAN SUPPLY; AND
IT MUST BE BY A LONG AND UNNATURAL ESTRANGEMENT, BY A DIVORCE WHICH
NO SUBSEQUENT CONNEXION CAN JUSTIFY, IF SUCH PRECIOUS REMAINS OF THE
EARLIEST ATTACHMENTS ARE EVER ENTIRELY OUTLIVED. TOO OFTEN, ALAS! IT IS
SO. FRATERNAL LOVE, SOMETIMES ALMOST EVERYTHING, IS AT OTHERS WORSE THAN
NOTHING. BUT WITH WILLIAM AND FANNY PRICE IT WAS STILL A SENTIMENT
IN ALL ITS PRIME AND FRESHNESS, WOUNDED BY NO OPPOSITION OF INTEREST,
COOLED BY NO SEPARATE ATTACHMENT, AND FEELING THE INFLUENCE OF TIME AND
ABSENCE ONLY IN ITS INCREASE.

AN AFFECTION SO AMIABLE WAS ADVANCING EACH IN THE OPINION OF ALL WHO HAD
HEARTS TO VALUE ANYTHING GOOD. HENRY CRAWFORD WAS AS MUCH STRUCK WITH
IT AS ANY. HE HONOURED THE WARM-HEARTED, BLUNT FONDNESS OF THE YOUNG
SAILOR, WHICH LED HIM TO SAY, WITH HIS HANDS STRETCHED TOWARDS FANNY'S
HEAD, "DO YOU KNOW, I BEGIN TO LIKE THAT QUEER FASHION ALREADY, THOUGH
WHEN I FIRST HEARD OF SUCH THINGS BEING DONE IN ENGLAND, I COULD
NOT BELIEVE IT; AND WHEN MRS. BROWN, AND THE OTHER WOMEN AT THE
COMMISSIONER'S AT GIBRALTAR, APPEARED IN THE SAME TRIM, I THOUGHT THEY
WERE MAD; BUT FANNY CAN RECONCILE ME TO ANYTHING"; AND SAW, WITH LIVELY
ADMIRATION, THE GLOW OF FANNY'S CHEEK, THE BRIGHTNESS OF HER EYE, THE
DEEP INTEREST, THE ABSORBED ATTENTION, WHILE HER BROTHER WAS DESCRIBING
ANY OF THE IMMINENT HAZARDS, OR TERRIFIC SCENES, WHICH SUCH A PERIOD AT
SEA MUST SUPPLY.

IT WAS A PICTURE WHICH HENRY CRAWFORD HAD MORAL TASTE ENOUGH TO VALUE.
FANNY'S ATTRACTIONS INCREASED--INCREASED TWOFOLD; FOR THE SENSIBILITY
WHICH BEAUTIFIED HER COMPLEXION AND ILLUMINED HER COUNTENANCE WAS AN
ATTRACTION IN ITSELF. HE WAS NO LONGER IN DOUBT OF THE CAPABILITIES OF
HER HEART. SHE HAD FEELING, GENUINE FEELING. IT WOULD BE SOMETHING TO
BE LOVED BY SUCH A GIRL, TO EXCITE THE FIRST ARDOURS OF HER YOUNG
UNSOPHISTICATED MIND! SHE INTERESTED HIM MORE THAN HE HAD FORESEEN. A
FORTNIGHT WAS NOT ENOUGH. HIS STAY BECAME INDEFINITE.

WILLIAM WAS OFTEN CALLED ON BY HIS UNCLE TO BE THE TALKER. HIS RECITALS
WERE AMUSING IN THEMSELVES TO SIR THOMAS, BUT THE CHIEF OBJECT IN
SEEKING THEM WAS TO UNDERSTAND THE RECITER, TO KNOW THE YOUNG MAN BY HIS
HISTORIES; AND HE LISTENED TO HIS CLEAR, SIMPLE, SPIRITED DETAILS
WITH FULL SATISFACTION, SEEING IN THEM THE PROOF OF GOOD PRINCIPLES,
PROFESSIONAL KNOWLEDGE, ENERGY, COURAGE, AND CHEERFULNESS, EVERYTHING
THAT COULD DESERVE OR PROMISE WELL. YOUNG AS HE WAS, WILLIAM HAD ALREADY
SEEN A GREAT DEAL. HE HAD BEEN IN THE MEDITERRANEAN; IN THE WEST INDIES;
IN THE MEDITERRANEAN AGAIN; HAD BEEN OFTEN TAKEN ON SHORE BY THE FAVOUR
OF HIS CAPTAIN, AND IN THE COURSE OF SEVEN YEARS HAD KNOWN EVERY VARIETY
OF DANGER WHICH SEA AND WAR TOGETHER COULD OFFER. WITH SUCH MEANS IN
HIS POWER HE HAD A RIGHT TO BE LISTENED TO; AND THOUGH MRS. NORRIS COULD
FIDGET ABOUT THE ROOM, AND DISTURB EVERYBODY IN QUEST OF TWO NEEDLEFULS
OF THREAD OR A SECOND-HAND SHIRT BUTTON, IN THE MIDST OF HER NEPHEW'S
ACCOUNT OF A SHIPWRECK OR AN ENGAGEMENT, EVERYBODY ELSE WAS ATTENTIVE;
AND EVEN LADY BERTRAM COULD NOT HEAR OF SUCH HORRORS UNMOVED, OR
WITHOUT SOMETIMES LIFTING HER EYES FROM HER WORK TO SAY, "DEAR ME! HOW
DISAGREEABLE! I WONDER ANYBODY CAN EVER GO TO SEA."

TO HENRY CRAWFORD THEY GAVE A DIFFERENT FEELING. HE LONGED TO HAVE BEEN
AT SEA, AND SEEN AND DONE AND SUFFERED AS MUCH. HIS HEART WAS WARMED,
HIS FANCY FIRED, AND HE FELT THE HIGHEST RESPECT FOR A LAD WHO, BEFORE
HE WAS TWENTY, HAD GONE THROUGH SUCH BODILY HARDSHIPS AND GIVEN SUCH
PROOFS OF MIND. THE GLORY OF HEROISM, OF USEFULNESS, OF EXERTION, OF
ENDURANCE, MADE HIS OWN HABITS OF SELFISH INDULGENCE APPEAR IN SHAMEFUL
CONTRAST; AND HE WISHED HE HAD BEEN A WILLIAM PRICE, DISTINGUISHING
HIMSELF AND WORKING HIS WAY TO FORTUNE AND CONSEQUENCE WITH SO MUCH
SELF-RESPECT AND HAPPY ARDOUR, INSTEAD OF WHAT HE WAS!

THE WISH WAS RATHER EAGER THAN LASTING. HE WAS ROUSED FROM THE REVERIE
OF RETROSPECTION AND REGRET PRODUCED BY IT, BY SOME INQUIRY FROM EDMUND
AS TO HIS PLANS FOR THE NEXT DAY'S HUNTING; AND HE FOUND IT WAS AS WELL
TO BE A MAN OF FORTUNE AT ONCE WITH HORSES AND GROOMS AT HIS COMMAND.
IN ONE RESPECT IT WAS BETTER, AS IT GAVE HIM THE MEANS OF CONFERRING A
KINDNESS WHERE HE WISHED TO OBLIGE. WITH SPIRITS, COURAGE, AND CURIOSITY
UP TO ANYTHING, WILLIAM EXPRESSED AN INCLINATION TO HUNT; AND CRAWFORD
COULD MOUNT HIM WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST INCONVENIENCE TO HIMSELF, AND WITH
ONLY SOME SCRUPLES TO OBVIATE IN SIR THOMAS, WHO KNEW BETTER THAN HIS
NEPHEW THE VALUE OF SUCH A LOAN, AND SOME ALARMS TO REASON AWAY IN
FANNY. SHE FEARED FOR WILLIAM; BY NO MEANS CONVINCED BY ALL THAT HE
COULD RELATE OF HIS OWN HORSEMANSHIP IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES, OF THE
SCRAMBLING PARTIES IN WHICH HE HAD BEEN ENGAGED, THE ROUGH HORSES AND
MULES HE HAD RIDDEN, OR HIS MANY NARROW ESCAPES FROM DREADFUL FALLS,
THAT HE WAS AT ALL EQUAL TO THE MANAGEMENT OF A HIGH-FED HUNTER IN AN
ENGLISH FOX-CHASE; NOR TILL HE RETURNED SAFE AND WELL, WITHOUT ACCIDENT
OR DISCREDIT, COULD SHE BE RECONCILED TO THE RISK, OR FEEL ANY OF THAT
OBLIGATION TO MR. CRAWFORD FOR LENDING THE HORSE WHICH HE HAD FULLY
INTENDED IT SHOULD PRODUCE. WHEN IT WAS PROVED, HOWEVER, TO HAVE DONE
WILLIAM NO HARM, SHE COULD ALLOW IT TO BE A KINDNESS, AND EVEN REWARD
THE OWNER WITH A SMILE WHEN THE ANIMAL WAS ONE MINUTE TENDERED TO HIS
USE AGAIN; AND THE NEXT, WITH THE GREATEST CORDIALITY, AND IN A MANNER
NOT TO BE RESISTED, MADE OVER TO HIS USE ENTIRELY SO LONG AS HE REMAINED
IN NORTHAMPTONSHIRE.

CHAPTER XXV

THE INTERCOURSE OF THE TWO FAMILIES WAS AT THIS PERIOD MORE NEARLY
RESTORED TO WHAT IT HAD BEEN IN THE AUTUMN, THAN ANY MEMBER OF THE
OLD INTIMACY HAD THOUGHT EVER LIKELY TO BE AGAIN. THE RETURN OF HENRY
CRAWFORD, AND THE ARRIVAL OF WILLIAM PRICE, HAD MUCH TO DO WITH IT,
BUT MUCH WAS STILL OWING TO SIR THOMAS'S MORE THAN TOLERATION OF THE
NEIGHBOURLY ATTEMPTS AT THE PARSONAGE. HIS MIND, NOW DISENGAGED FROM
THE CARES WHICH HAD PRESSED ON HIM AT FIRST, WAS AT LEISURE TO FIND
THE GRANTS AND THEIR YOUNG INMATES REALLY WORTH VISITING; AND THOUGH
INFINITELY ABOVE SCHEMING OR CONTRIVING FOR ANY THE MOST ADVANTAGEOUS
MATRIMONIAL ESTABLISHMENT THAT COULD BE AMONG THE APPARENT POSSIBILITIES
OF ANY ONE MOST DEAR TO HIM, AND DISDAINING EVEN AS A LITTLENESS THE
BEING QUICK-SIGHTED ON SUCH POINTS, HE COULD NOT AVOID PERCEIVING, IN
A GRAND AND CARELESS WAY, THAT MR. CRAWFORD WAS SOMEWHAT DISTINGUISHING
HIS NIECE--NOR PERHAPS REFRAIN (THOUGH UNCONSCIOUSLY) FROM GIVING A MORE
WILLING ASSENT TO INVITATIONS ON THAT ACCOUNT.

HIS READINESS, HOWEVER, IN AGREEING TO DINE AT THE PARSONAGE, WHEN THE
GENERAL INVITATION WAS AT LAST HAZARDED, AFTER MANY DEBATES AND MANY
DOUBTS AS TO WHETHER IT WERE WORTH WHILE, "BECAUSE SIR THOMAS SEEMED
SO ILL INCLINED, AND LADY BERTRAM WAS SO INDOLENT!" PROCEEDED FROM
GOOD-BREEDING AND GOODWILL ALONE, AND HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH MR.
CRAWFORD, BUT AS BEING ONE IN AN AGREEABLE GROUP: FOR IT WAS IN THE
COURSE OF THAT VERY VISIT THAT HE FIRST BEGAN TO THINK THAT ANY ONE IN
THE HABIT OF SUCH IDLE OBSERVATIONS WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT MR.
CRAWFORD WAS THE ADMIRER OF FANNY PRICE.

THE MEETING WAS GENERALLY FELT TO BE A PLEASANT ONE, BEING COMPOSED IN A
GOOD PROPORTION OF THOSE WHO WOULD TALK AND THOSE WHO WOULD LISTEN;
AND THE DINNER ITSELF WAS ELEGANT AND PLENTIFUL, ACCORDING TO THE USUAL
STYLE OF THE GRANTS, AND TOO MUCH ACCORDING TO THE USUAL HABITS OF
ALL TO RAISE ANY EMOTION EXCEPT IN MRS. NORRIS, WHO COULD NEVER BEHOLD
EITHER THE WIDE TABLE OR THE NUMBER OF DISHES ON IT WITH PATIENCE, AND
WHO DID ALWAYS CONTRIVE TO EXPERIENCE SOME EVIL FROM THE PASSING OF THE
SERVANTS BEHIND HER CHAIR, AND TO BRING AWAY SOME FRESH CONVICTION OF
ITS BEING IMPOSSIBLE AMONG SO MANY DISHES BUT THAT SOME MUST BE COLD.

IN THE EVENING IT WAS FOUND, ACCORDING TO THE PREDETERMINATION OF MRS.
GRANT AND HER SISTER, THAT AFTER MAKING UP THE WHIST-TABLE THERE WOULD
REMAIN SUFFICIENT FOR A ROUND GAME, AND EVERYBODY BEING AS PERFECTLY
COMPLYING AND WITHOUT A CHOICE AS ON SUCH OCCASIONS THEY ALWAYS ARE,
SPECULATION WAS DECIDED ON ALMOST AS SOON AS WHIST; AND LADY BERTRAM
SOON FOUND HERSELF IN THE CRITICAL SITUATION OF BEING APPLIED TO FOR HER
OWN CHOICE BETWEEN THE GAMES, AND BEING REQUIRED EITHER TO DRAW A CARD
FOR WHIST OR NOT. SHE HESITATED. LUCKILY SIR THOMAS WAS AT HAND.

"WHAT SHALL I DO, SIR THOMAS? WHIST AND SPECULATION; WHICH WILL AMUSE ME
MOST?"

SIR THOMAS, AFTER A MOMENT'S THOUGHT, RECOMMENDED SPECULATION. HE WAS
A WHIST PLAYER HIMSELF, AND PERHAPS MIGHT FEEL THAT IT WOULD NOT MUCH
AMUSE HIM TO HAVE HER FOR A PARTNER.

"VERY WELL," WAS HER LADYSHIP'S CONTENTED ANSWER; "THEN SPECULATION, IF
YOU PLEASE, MRS. GRANT. I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT, BUT FANNY MUST TEACH
ME."

HERE FANNY INTERPOSED, HOWEVER, WITH ANXIOUS PROTESTATIONS OF HER OWN
EQUAL IGNORANCE; SHE HAD NEVER PLAYED THE GAME NOR SEEN IT PLAYED IN
HER LIFE; AND LADY BERTRAM FELT A MOMENT'S INDECISION AGAIN; BUT UPON
EVERYBODY'S ASSURING HER THAT NOTHING COULD BE SO EASY, THAT IT WAS THE
EASIEST GAME ON THE CARDS, AND HENRY CRAWFORD'S STEPPING FORWARD WITH A
MOST EARNEST REQUEST TO BE ALLOWED TO SIT BETWEEN HER LADYSHIP AND MISS
PRICE, AND TEACH THEM BOTH, IT WAS SO SETTLED; AND SIR THOMAS, MRS.
NORRIS, AND DR. AND MRS. GRANT BEING SEATED AT THE TABLE OF PRIME
INTELLECTUAL STATE AND DIGNITY, THE REMAINING SIX, UNDER MISS CRAWFORD'S
DIRECTION, WERE ARRANGED ROUND THE OTHER. IT WAS A FINE ARRANGEMENT
FOR HENRY CRAWFORD, WHO WAS CLOSE TO FANNY, AND WITH HIS HANDS FULL OF
BUSINESS, HAVING TWO PERSONS' CARDS TO MANAGE AS WELL AS HIS OWN; FOR
THOUGH IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR FANNY NOT TO FEEL HERSELF MISTRESS OF THE
RULES OF THE GAME IN THREE MINUTES, HE HAD YET TO INSPIRIT HER PLAY,
SHARPEN HER AVARICE, AND HARDEN HER HEART, WHICH, ESPECIALLY IN ANY
COMPETITION WITH WILLIAM, WAS A WORK OF SOME DIFFICULTY; AND AS FOR LADY
BERTRAM, HE MUST CONTINUE IN CHARGE OF ALL HER FAME AND FORTUNE THROUGH
THE WHOLE EVENING; AND IF QUICK ENOUGH TO KEEP HER FROM LOOKING AT HER
CARDS WHEN THE DEAL BEGAN, MUST DIRECT HER IN WHATEVER WAS TO BE DONE
WITH THEM TO THE END OF IT.

HE WAS IN HIGH SPIRITS, DOING EVERYTHING WITH HAPPY EASE, AND PREEMINENT
IN ALL THE LIVELY TURNS, QUICK RESOURCES, AND PLAYFUL IMPUDENCE THAT
COULD DO HONOUR TO THE GAME; AND THE ROUND TABLE WAS ALTOGETHER A VERY
COMFORTABLE CONTRAST TO THE STEADY SOBRIETY AND ORDERLY SILENCE OF THE
OTHER.

TWICE HAD SIR THOMAS INQUIRED INTO THE ENJOYMENT AND SUCCESS OF HIS
LADY, BUT IN VAIN; NO PAUSE WAS LONG ENOUGH FOR THE TIME HIS MEASURED
MANNER NEEDED; AND VERY LITTLE OF HER STATE COULD BE KNOWN TILL MRS.
GRANT WAS ABLE, AT THE END OF THE FIRST RUBBER, TO GO TO HER AND PAY HER
COMPLIMENTS.

"I HOPE YOUR LADYSHIP IS PLEASED WITH THE GAME."

"OH DEAR, YES! VERY ENTERTAINING INDEED. A VERY ODD GAME. I DO NOT KNOW
WHAT IT IS ALL ABOUT. I AM NEVER TO SEE MY CARDS; AND MR. CRAWFORD DOES
ALL THE REST."

"BERTRAM," SAID CRAWFORD, SOME TIME AFTERWARDS, TAKING THE OPPORTUNITY
OF A LITTLE LANGUOR IN THE GAME, "I HAVE NEVER TOLD YOU WHAT HAPPENED TO
ME YESTERDAY IN MY RIDE HOME." THEY HAD BEEN HUNTING TOGETHER, AND WERE
IN THE MIDST OF A GOOD RUN, AND AT SOME DISTANCE FROM MANSFIELD, WHEN
HIS HORSE BEING FOUND TO HAVE FLUNG A SHOE, HENRY CRAWFORD HAD BEEN
OBLIGED TO GIVE UP, AND MAKE THE BEST OF HIS WAY BACK. "I TOLD YOU I
LOST MY WAY AFTER PASSING THAT OLD FARMHOUSE WITH THE YEW-TREES, BECAUSE
I CAN NEVER BEAR TO ASK; BUT I HAVE NOT TOLD YOU THAT, WITH MY USUAL
LUCK--FOR I NEVER DO WRONG WITHOUT GAINING BY IT--I FOUND MYSELF IN DUE
TIME IN THE VERY PLACE WHICH I HAD A CURIOSITY TO SEE. I WAS SUDDENLY,
UPON TURNING THE CORNER OF A STEEPISH DOWNY FIELD, IN THE MIDST OF
A RETIRED LITTLE VILLAGE BETWEEN GENTLY RISING HILLS; A SMALL STREAM
BEFORE ME TO BE FORDED, A CHURCH STANDING ON A SORT OF KNOLL TO MY
RIGHT--WHICH CHURCH WAS STRIKINGLY LARGE AND HANDSOME FOR THE PLACE, AND
NOT A GENTLEMAN OR HALF A GENTLEMAN'S HOUSE TO BE SEEN EXCEPTING ONE--TO
BE PRESUMED THE PARSONAGE--WITHIN A STONE'S THROW OF THE SAID KNOLL AND
CHURCH. I FOUND MYSELF, IN SHORT, IN THORNTON LACEY."

"IT SOUNDS LIKE IT," SAID EDMUND; "BUT WHICH WAY DID YOU TURN AFTER
PASSING SEWELL'S FARM?"

"I ANSWER NO SUCH IRRELEVANT AND INSIDIOUS QUESTIONS; THOUGH WERE I TO
ANSWER ALL THAT YOU COULD PUT IN THE COURSE OF AN HOUR, YOU WOULD NEVER
BE ABLE TO PROVE THAT IT WAS NOT THORNTON LACEY--FOR SUCH IT CERTAINLY
WAS."

"YOU INQUIRED, THEN?"

"NO, I NEVER INQUIRE. BUT I TOLD A MAN MENDING A HEDGE THAT IT WAS
THORNTON LACEY, AND HE AGREED TO IT."

"YOU HAVE A GOOD MEMORY. I HAD FORGOTTEN HAVING EVER TOLD YOU HALF SO
MUCH OF THE PLACE."

THORNTON LACEY WAS THE NAME OF HIS IMPENDING LIVING, AS MISS CRAWFORD
WELL KNEW; AND HER INTEREST IN A NEGOTIATION FOR WILLIAM PRICE'S KNAVE
INCREASED.

"WELL," CONTINUED EDMUND, "AND HOW DID YOU LIKE WHAT YOU SAW?"

"VERY MUCH INDEED. YOU ARE A LUCKY FELLOW. THERE WILL BE WORK FOR FIVE
SUMMERS AT LEAST BEFORE THE PLACE IS LIVEABLE."

"NO, NO, NOT SO BAD AS THAT. THE FARMYARD MUST BE MOVED, I GRANT YOU;
BUT I AM NOT AWARE OF ANYTHING ELSE. THE HOUSE IS BY NO MEANS BAD, AND
WHEN THE YARD IS REMOVED, THERE MAY BE A VERY TOLERABLE APPROACH TO IT."

"THE FARMYARD MUST BE CLEARED AWAY ENTIRELY, AND PLANTED UP TO SHUT
OUT THE BLACKSMITH'S SHOP. THE HOUSE MUST BE TURNED TO FRONT THE EAST
INSTEAD OF THE NORTH--THE ENTRANCE AND PRINCIPAL ROOMS, I MEAN, MUST BE
ON THAT SIDE, WHERE THE VIEW IS REALLY VERY PRETTY; I AM SURE IT MAY BE
DONE. AND THERE MUST BE YOUR APPROACH, THROUGH WHAT IS AT PRESENT THE
GARDEN. YOU MUST MAKE A NEW GARDEN AT WHAT IS NOW THE BACK OF THE HOUSE;
WHICH WILL BE GIVING IT THE BEST ASPECT IN THE WORLD, SLOPING TO THE
SOUTH-EAST. THE GROUND SEEMS PRECISELY FORMED FOR IT. I RODE FIFTY YARDS
UP THE LANE, BETWEEN THE CHURCH AND THE HOUSE, IN ORDER TO LOOK ABOUT
ME; AND SAW HOW IT MIGHT ALL BE. NOTHING CAN BE EASIER. THE MEADOWS
BEYOND WHAT WILL BE THE GARDEN, AS WELL AS WHAT NOW IS, SWEEPING
ROUND FROM THE LANE I STOOD IN TO THE NORTH-EAST, THAT IS, TO THE
PRINCIPAL ROAD THROUGH THE VILLAGE, MUST BE ALL LAID TOGETHER, OF
COURSE; VERY PRETTY MEADOWS THEY ARE, FINELY SPRINKLED WITH TIMBER. THEY
BELONG TO THE LIVING, I SUPPOSE; IF NOT, YOU MUST PURCHASE THEM. THEN
THE STREAM--SOMETHING MUST BE DONE WITH THE STREAM; BUT I COULD NOT
QUITE DETERMINE WHAT. I HAD TWO OR THREE IDEAS."

"AND I HAVE TWO OR THREE IDEAS ALSO," SAID EDMUND, "AND ONE OF THEM IS,
THAT VERY LITTLE OF YOUR PLAN FOR THORNTON LACEY WILL EVER BE PUT IN
PRACTICE. I MUST BE SATISFIED WITH RATHER LESS ORNAMENT AND BEAUTY. I
THINK THE HOUSE AND PREMISES MAY BE MADE COMFORTABLE, AND GIVEN THE AIR
OF A GENTLEMAN'S RESIDENCE, WITHOUT ANY VERY HEAVY EXPENSE, AND THAT
MUST SUFFICE ME; AND, I HOPE, MAY SUFFICE ALL WHO CARE ABOUT ME."

MISS CRAWFORD, A LITTLE SUSPICIOUS AND RESENTFUL OF A CERTAIN TONE OF
VOICE, AND A CERTAIN HALF-LOOK ATTENDING THE LAST EXPRESSION OF HIS
HOPE, MADE A HASTY FINISH OF HER DEALINGS WITH WILLIAM PRICE; AND
SECURING HIS KNAVE AT AN EXORBITANT RATE, EXCLAIMED, "THERE, I WILL
STAKE MY LAST LIKE A WOMAN OF SPIRIT. NO COLD PRUDENCE FOR ME. I AM NOT
BORN TO SIT STILL AND DO NOTHING. IF I LOSE THE GAME, IT SHALL NOT BE
FROM NOT STRIVING FOR IT."

THE GAME WAS HERS, AND ONLY DID NOT PAY HER FOR WHAT SHE HAD GIVEN
TO SECURE IT. ANOTHER DEAL PROCEEDED, AND CRAWFORD BEGAN AGAIN ABOUT
THORNTON LACEY.

"MY PLAN MAY NOT BE THE BEST POSSIBLE: I HAD NOT MANY MINUTES TO FORM
IT IN; BUT YOU MUST DO A GOOD DEAL. THE PLACE DESERVES IT, AND YOU
WILL FIND YOURSELF NOT SATISFIED WITH MUCH LESS THAN IT IS CAPABLE OF.
(EXCUSE ME, YOUR LADYSHIP MUST NOT SEE YOUR CARDS. THERE, LET THEM LIE
JUST BEFORE YOU.) THE PLACE DESERVES IT, BERTRAM. YOU TALK OF GIVING IT
THE AIR OF A GENTLEMAN'S RESIDENCE. THAT WILL BE DONE BY THE REMOVAL
OF THE FARMYARD; FOR, INDEPENDENT OF THAT TERRIBLE NUISANCE, I NEVER SAW
A HOUSE OF THE KIND WHICH HAD IN ITSELF SO MUCH THE AIR OF A
GENTLEMAN'S RESIDENCE, SO MUCH THE LOOK OF A SOMETHING ABOVE A MERE
PARSONAGE-HOUSE--ABOVE THE EXPENDITURE OF A FEW HUNDREDS A YEAR. IT IS
NOT A SCRAMBLING COLLECTION OF LOW SINGLE ROOMS, WITH AS MANY ROOFS
AS WINDOWS; IT IS NOT CRAMPED INTO THE VULGAR COMPACTNESS OF A SQUARE
FARMHOUSE: IT IS A SOLID, ROOMY, MANSION-LIKE LOOKING HOUSE, SUCH AS
ONE MIGHT SUPPOSE A RESPECTABLE OLD COUNTRY FAMILY HAD LIVED IN FROM
GENERATION TO GENERATION, THROUGH TWO CENTURIES AT LEAST, AND WERE NOW
SPENDING FROM TWO TO THREE THOUSAND A YEAR IN." MISS CRAWFORD LISTENED,
AND EDMUND AGREED TO THIS. "THE AIR OF A GENTLEMAN'S RESIDENCE,
THEREFORE, YOU CANNOT BUT GIVE IT, IF YOU DO ANYTHING. BUT IT IS CAPABLE
OF MUCH MORE. (LET ME SEE, MARY; LADY BERTRAM BIDS A DOZEN FOR THAT
QUEEN; NO, NO, A DOZEN IS MORE THAN IT IS WORTH. LADY BERTRAM DOES NOT
BID A DOZEN. SHE WILL HAVE NOTHING TO SAY TO IT. GO ON, GO ON.) BY SOME
SUCH IMPROVEMENTS AS I HAVE SUGGESTED (I DO NOT REALLY REQUIRE YOU TO
PROCEED UPON MY PLAN, THOUGH, BY THE BYE, I DOUBT ANYBODY'S STRIKING OUT
A BETTER) YOU MAY GIVE IT A HIGHER CHARACTER. YOU MAY RAISE IT INTO
A PLACE. FROM BEING THE MERE GENTLEMAN'S RESIDENCE, IT BECOMES, BY
JUDICIOUS IMPROVEMENT, THE RESIDENCE OF A MAN OF EDUCATION, TASTE,
MODERN MANNERS, GOOD CONNEXIONS. ALL THIS MAY BE STAMPED ON IT; AND THAT
HOUSE RECEIVE SUCH AN AIR AS TO MAKE ITS OWNER BE SET DOWN AS THE
GREAT LANDHOLDER OF THE PARISH BY EVERY CREATURE TRAVELLING THE ROAD;
ESPECIALLY AS THERE IS NO REAL SQUIRE'S HOUSE TO DISPUTE THE POINT--A
CIRCUMSTANCE, BETWEEN OURSELVES, TO ENHANCE THE VALUE OF SUCH A
SITUATION IN POINT OF PRIVILEGE AND INDEPENDENCE BEYOND ALL CALCULATION.
YOU THINK WITH ME, I HOPE" (TURNING WITH A SOFTENED VOICE TO FANNY).
"HAVE YOU EVER SEEN THE PLACE?"

FANNY GAVE A QUICK NEGATIVE, AND TRIED TO HIDE HER INTEREST IN THE
SUBJECT BY AN EAGER ATTENTION TO HER BROTHER, WHO WAS DRIVING AS HARD A
BARGAIN, AND IMPOSING ON HER AS MUCH AS HE COULD; BUT CRAWFORD PURSUED
WITH "NO, NO, YOU MUST NOT PART WITH THE QUEEN. YOU HAVE BOUGHT HER TOO
DEARLY, AND YOUR BROTHER DOES NOT OFFER HALF HER VALUE. NO, NO, SIR,
HANDS OFF, HANDS OFF. YOUR SISTER DOES NOT PART WITH THE QUEEN. SHE IS
QUITE DETERMINED. THE GAME WILL BE YOURS," TURNING TO HER AGAIN; "IT
WILL CERTAINLY BE YOURS."

"AND FANNY HAD MUCH RATHER IT WERE WILLIAM'S," SAID EDMUND, SMILING AT
HER. "POOR FANNY! NOT ALLOWED TO CHEAT HERSELF AS SHE WISHES!"

"MR. BERTRAM," SAID MISS CRAWFORD, A FEW MINUTES AFTERWARDS, "YOU KNOW
HENRY TO BE SUCH A CAPITAL IMPROVER, THAT YOU CANNOT POSSIBLY ENGAGE IN
ANYTHING OF THE SORT AT THORNTON LACEY WITHOUT ACCEPTING HIS HELP. ONLY
THINK HOW USEFUL HE WAS AT SOTHERTON! ONLY THINK WHAT GRAND THINGS WERE
PRODUCED THERE BY OUR ALL GOING WITH HIM ONE HOT DAY IN AUGUST TO DRIVE
ABOUT THE GROUNDS, AND SEE HIS GENIUS TAKE FIRE. THERE WE WENT, AND
THERE WE CAME HOME AGAIN; AND WHAT WAS DONE THERE IS NOT TO BE TOLD!"

FANNY'S EYES WERE TURNED ON CRAWFORD FOR A MOMENT WITH AN EXPRESSION
MORE THAN GRAVE--EVEN REPROACHFUL; BUT ON CATCHING HIS, WERE INSTANTLY
WITHDRAWN. WITH SOMETHING OF CONSCIOUSNESS HE SHOOK HIS HEAD AT HIS
SISTER, AND LAUGHINGLY REPLIED, "I CANNOT SAY THERE WAS MUCH DONE AT
SOTHERTON; BUT IT WAS A HOT DAY, AND WE WERE ALL WALKING AFTER EACH
OTHER, AND BEWILDERED." AS SOON AS A GENERAL BUZZ GAVE HIM SHELTER, HE
ADDED, IN A LOW VOICE, DIRECTED SOLELY AT FANNY, "I SHOULD BE SORRY TO
HAVE MY POWERS OF PLANNING JUDGED OF BY THE DAY AT SOTHERTON. I SEE
THINGS VERY DIFFERENTLY NOW. DO NOT THINK OF ME AS I APPEARED THEN."

SOTHERTON WAS A WORD TO CATCH MRS. NORRIS, AND BEING JUST THEN IN THE
HAPPY LEISURE WHICH FOLLOWED SECURING THE ODD TRICK BY SIR THOMAS'S
CAPITAL PLAY AND HER OWN AGAINST DR. AND MRS. GRANT'S GREAT HANDS,
SHE CALLED OUT, IN HIGH GOOD-HUMOUR, "SOTHERTON! YES, THAT IS A PLACE,
INDEED, AND WE HAD A CHARMING DAY THERE. WILLIAM, YOU ARE QUITE OUT OF
LUCK; BUT THE NEXT TIME YOU COME, I HOPE DEAR MR. AND MRS. RUSHWORTH
WILL BE AT HOME, AND I AM SURE I CAN ANSWER FOR YOUR BEING KINDLY
RECEIVED BY BOTH. YOUR COUSINS ARE NOT OF A SORT TO FORGET THEIR
RELATIONS, AND MR. RUSHWORTH IS A MOST AMIABLE MAN. THEY ARE AT BRIGHTON
NOW, YOU KNOW; IN ONE OF THE BEST HOUSES THERE, AS MR. RUSHWORTH'S FINE
FORTUNE GIVES THEM A RIGHT TO BE. I DO NOT EXACTLY KNOW THE DISTANCE,
BUT WHEN YOU GET BACK TO PORTSMOUTH, IF IT IS NOT VERY FAR OFF, YOU
OUGHT TO GO OVER AND PAY YOUR RESPECTS TO THEM; AND I COULD SEND A
LITTLE PARCEL BY YOU THAT I WANT TO GET CONVEYED TO YOUR COUSINS."

"I SHOULD BE VERY HAPPY, AUNT; BUT BRIGHTON IS ALMOST BY BEACHEY HEAD;
AND IF I COULD GET SO FAR, I COULD NOT EXPECT TO BE WELCOME IN SUCH A
SMART PLACE AS THAT--POOR SCRUBBY MIDSHIPMAN AS I AM."

MRS. NORRIS WAS BEGINNING AN EAGER ASSURANCE OF THE AFFABILITY HE MIGHT
DEPEND ON, WHEN SHE WAS STOPPED BY SIR THOMAS'S SAYING WITH AUTHORITY,
"I DO NOT ADVISE YOUR GOING TO BRIGHTON, WILLIAM, AS I TRUST YOU MAY
SOON HAVE MORE CONVENIENT OPPORTUNITIES OF MEETING; BUT MY DAUGHTERS
WOULD BE HAPPY TO SEE THEIR COUSINS ANYWHERE; AND YOU WILL FIND MR.
RUSHWORTH MOST SINCERELY DISPOSED TO REGARD ALL THE CONNEXIONS OF OUR
FAMILY AS HIS OWN."

"I WOULD RATHER FIND HIM PRIVATE SECRETARY TO THE FIRST LORD THAN
ANYTHING ELSE," WAS WILLIAM'S ONLY ANSWER, IN AN UNDERVOICE, NOT MEANT
TO REACH FAR, AND THE SUBJECT DROPPED.

AS YET SIR THOMAS HAD SEEN NOTHING TO REMARK IN MR. CRAWFORD'S
BEHAVIOUR; BUT WHEN THE WHIST-TABLE BROKE UP AT THE END OF THE SECOND
RUBBER, AND LEAVING DR. GRANT AND MRS. NORRIS TO DISPUTE OVER THEIR LAST
PLAY, HE BECAME A LOOKER-ON AT THE OTHER, HE FOUND HIS NIECE THE
OBJECT OF ATTENTIONS, OR RATHER OF PROFESSIONS, OF A SOMEWHAT POINTED
CHARACTER.

HENRY CRAWFORD WAS IN THE FIRST GLOW OF ANOTHER SCHEME ABOUT THORNTON
LACEY; AND NOT BEING ABLE TO CATCH EDMUND'S EAR, WAS DETAILING IT TO HIS
FAIR NEIGHBOUR WITH A LOOK OF CONSIDERABLE EARNESTNESS. HIS SCHEME WAS
TO RENT THE HOUSE HIMSELF THE FOLLOWING WINTER, THAT HE MIGHT HAVE A
HOME OF HIS OWN IN THAT NEIGHBOURHOOD; AND IT WAS NOT MERELY FOR THE USE
OF IT IN THE HUNTING-SEASON (AS HE WAS THEN TELLING HER), THOUGH THAT
CONSIDERATION HAD CERTAINLY SOME WEIGHT, FEELING AS HE DID THAT, IN
SPITE OF ALL DR. GRANT'S VERY GREAT KINDNESS, IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM
AND HIS HORSES TO BE ACCOMMODATED WHERE THEY NOW WERE WITHOUT MATERIAL
INCONVENIENCE; BUT HIS ATTACHMENT TO THAT NEIGHBOURHOOD DID NOT DEPEND
UPON ONE AMUSEMENT OR ONE SEASON OF THE YEAR: HE HAD SET HIS HEART UPON
HAVING A SOMETHING THERE THAT HE COULD COME TO AT ANY TIME, A LITTLE
HOMESTALL AT HIS COMMAND, WHERE ALL THE HOLIDAYS OF HIS YEAR MIGHT BE
SPENT, AND HE MIGHT FIND HIMSELF CONTINUING, IMPROVING, AND PERFECTING
THAT FRIENDSHIP AND INTIMACY WITH THE MANSFIELD PARK FAMILY WHICH WAS
INCREASING IN VALUE TO HIM EVERY DAY. SIR THOMAS HEARD AND WAS NOT
OFFENDED. THERE WAS NO WANT OF RESPECT IN THE YOUNG MAN'S ADDRESS;
AND FANNY'S RECEPTION OF IT WAS SO PROPER AND MODEST, SO CALM AND
UNINVITING, THAT HE HAD NOTHING TO CENSURE IN HER. SHE SAID LITTLE,
ASSENTED ONLY HERE AND THERE, AND BETRAYED NO INCLINATION EITHER OF
APPROPRIATING ANY PART OF THE COMPLIMENT TO HERSELF, OR OF STRENGTHENING
HIS VIEWS IN FAVOUR OF NORTHAMPTONSHIRE. FINDING BY WHOM HE WAS
OBSERVED, HENRY CRAWFORD ADDRESSED HIMSELF ON THE SAME SUBJECT TO SIR
THOMAS, IN A MORE EVERYDAY TONE, BUT STILL WITH FEELING.

"I WANT TO BE YOUR NEIGHBOUR, SIR THOMAS, AS YOU HAVE, PERHAPS, HEARD ME
TELLING MISS PRICE. MAY I HOPE FOR YOUR ACQUIESCENCE, AND FOR YOUR NOT
INFLUENCING YOUR SON AGAINST SUCH A TENANT?"

SIR THOMAS, POLITELY BOWING, REPLIED, "IT IS THE ONLY WAY, SIR, IN WHICH
I COULD NOT WISH YOU ESTABLISHED AS A PERMANENT NEIGHBOUR; BUT I HOPE,
AND BELIEVE, THAT EDMUND WILL OCCUPY HIS OWN HOUSE AT THORNTON LACEY.
EDMUND, AM I SAYING TOO MUCH?"

EDMUND, ON THIS APPEAL, HAD FIRST TO HEAR WHAT WAS GOING ON; BUT, ON
UNDERSTANDING THE QUESTION, WAS AT NO LOSS FOR AN ANSWER.

"CERTAINLY, SIR, I HAVE NO IDEA BUT OF RESIDENCE. BUT, CRAWFORD, THOUGH
I REFUSE YOU AS A TENANT, COME TO ME AS A FRIEND. CONSIDER THE HOUSE AS
HALF YOUR OWN EVERY WINTER, AND WE WILL ADD TO THE STABLES ON YOUR OWN
IMPROVED PLAN, AND WITH ALL THE IMPROVEMENTS OF YOUR IMPROVED PLAN THAT
MAY OCCUR TO YOU THIS SPRING."

"WE SHALL BE THE LOSERS," CONTINUED SIR THOMAS. "HIS GOING, THOUGH ONLY
EIGHT MILES, WILL BE AN UNWELCOME CONTRACTION OF OUR FAMILY CIRCLE; BUT
I SHOULD HAVE BEEN DEEPLY MORTIFIED IF ANY SON OF MINE COULD RECONCILE
HIMSELF TO DOING LESS. IT IS PERFECTLY NATURAL THAT YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE
THOUGHT MUCH ON THE SUBJECT, MR. CRAWFORD. BUT A PARISH HAS WANTS AND
CLAIMS WHICH CAN BE KNOWN ONLY BY A CLERGYMAN CONSTANTLY RESIDENT, AND
WHICH NO PROXY CAN BE CAPABLE OF SATISFYING TO THE SAME EXTENT. EDMUND
MIGHT, IN THE COMMON PHRASE, DO THE DUTY OF THORNTON, THAT IS, HE MIGHT
READ PRAYERS AND PREACH, WITHOUT GIVING UP MANSFIELD PARK: HE MIGHT RIDE
OVER EVERY SUNDAY, TO A HOUSE NOMINALLY INHABITED, AND GO THROUGH DIVINE
SERVICE; HE MIGHT BE THE CLERGYMAN OF THORNTON LACEY EVERY SEVENTH DAY,
FOR THREE OR FOUR HOURS, IF THAT WOULD CONTENT HIM. BUT IT WILL NOT.
HE KNOWS THAT HUMAN NATURE NEEDS MORE LESSONS THAN A WEEKLY SERMON CAN
CONVEY; AND THAT IF HE DOES NOT LIVE AMONG HIS PARISHIONERS, AND PROVE
HIMSELF, BY CONSTANT ATTENTION, THEIR WELL-WISHER AND FRIEND, HE DOES
VERY LITTLE EITHER FOR THEIR GOOD OR HIS OWN."

MR. CRAWFORD BOWED HIS ACQUIESCENCE.

"I REPEAT AGAIN," ADDED SIR THOMAS, "THAT THORNTON LACEY IS THE ONLY
HOUSE IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD IN WHICH I SHOULD NOT BE HAPPY TO WAIT ON
MR. CRAWFORD AS OCCUPIER."

MR. CRAWFORD BOWED HIS THANKS.

"SIR THOMAS," SAID EDMUND, "UNDOUBTEDLY UNDERSTANDS THE DUTY OF A PARISH
PRIEST. WE MUST HOPE HIS SON MAY PROVE THAT HE KNOWS IT TOO."

WHATEVER EFFECT SIR THOMAS'S LITTLE HARANGUE MIGHT REALLY PRODUCE ON MR.
CRAWFORD, IT RAISED SOME AWKWARD SENSATIONS IN TWO OF THE OTHERS, TWO
OF HIS MOST ATTENTIVE LISTENERS--MISS CRAWFORD AND FANNY. ONE OF
WHOM, HAVING NEVER BEFORE UNDERSTOOD THAT THORNTON WAS SO SOON AND SO
COMPLETELY TO BE HIS HOME, WAS PONDERING WITH DOWNCAST EYES ON WHAT IT
WOULD BE NOT TO SEE EDMUND EVERY DAY; AND THE OTHER, STARTLED FROM THE
AGREEABLE FANCIES SHE HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY INDULGING ON THE STRENGTH OF
HER BROTHER'S DESCRIPTION, NO LONGER ABLE, IN THE PICTURE SHE HAD
BEEN FORMING OF A FUTURE THORNTON, TO SHUT OUT THE CHURCH, SINK THE
CLERGYMAN, AND SEE ONLY THE RESPECTABLE, ELEGANT, MODERNISED, AND
OCCASIONAL RESIDENCE OF A MAN OF INDEPENDENT FORTUNE, WAS CONSIDERING
SIR THOMAS, WITH DECIDED ILL-WILL, AS THE DESTROYER OF ALL THIS, AND
SUFFERING THE MORE FROM THAT INVOLUNTARY FORBEARANCE WHICH HIS CHARACTER
AND MANNER COMMANDED, AND FROM NOT DARING TO RELIEVE HERSELF BY A SINGLE
ATTEMPT AT THROWING RIDICULE ON HIS CAUSE.

ALL THE AGREEABLE OF HER SPECULATION WAS OVER FOR THAT HOUR. IT WAS
TIME TO HAVE DONE WITH CARDS, IF SERMONS PREVAILED; AND SHE WAS GLAD TO
FIND IT NECESSARY TO COME TO A CONCLUSION, AND BE ABLE TO REFRESH HER
SPIRITS BY A CHANGE OF PLACE AND NEIGHBOUR.

THE CHIEF OF THE PARTY WERE NOW COLLECTED IRREGULARLY ROUND THE
FIRE, AND WAITING THE FINAL BREAK-UP. WILLIAM AND FANNY WERE THE MOST
DETACHED. THEY REMAINED TOGETHER AT THE OTHERWISE DESERTED CARD-TABLE,
TALKING VERY COMFORTABLY, AND NOT THINKING OF THE REST, TILL SOME OF THE
REST BEGAN TO THINK OF THEM. HENRY CRAWFORD'S CHAIR WAS THE FIRST TO BE
GIVEN A DIRECTION TOWARDS THEM, AND HE SAT SILENTLY OBSERVING THEM FOR A
FEW MINUTES; HIMSELF, IN THE MEANWHILE, OBSERVED BY SIR THOMAS, WHO WAS
STANDING IN CHAT WITH DR. GRANT.

"THIS IS THE ASSEMBLY NIGHT," SAID WILLIAM. "IF I WERE AT PORTSMOUTH I
SHOULD BE AT IT, PERHAPS."

"BUT YOU DO NOT WISH YOURSELF AT PORTSMOUTH, WILLIAM?"

"NO, FANNY, THAT I DO NOT. I SHALL HAVE ENOUGH OF PORTSMOUTH AND OF
DANCING TOO, WHEN I CANNOT HAVE YOU. AND I DO NOT KNOW THAT THERE WOULD
BE ANY GOOD IN GOING TO THE ASSEMBLY, FOR I MIGHT NOT GET A PARTNER.
THE PORTSMOUTH GIRLS TURN UP THEIR NOSES AT ANYBODY WHO HAS NOT A
COMMISSION. ONE MIGHT AS WELL BE NOTHING AS A MIDSHIPMAN. ONE IS
NOTHING, INDEED. YOU REMEMBER THE GREGORYS; THEY ARE GROWN UP AMAZING
FINE GIRLS, BUT THEY WILL HARDLY SPEAK TO ME, BECAUSE LUCY IS COURTED
BY A LIEUTENANT."

"OH! SHAME, SHAME! BUT NEVER MIND IT, WILLIAM" (HER OWN CHEEKS IN A
GLOW OF INDIGNATION AS SHE SPOKE). "IT IS NOT WORTH MINDING. IT IS NO
REFLECTION ON YOU; IT IS NO MORE THAN WHAT THE GREATEST ADMIRALS HAVE
ALL EXPERIENCED, MORE OR LESS, IN THEIR TIME. YOU MUST THINK OF THAT,
YOU MUST TRY TO MAKE UP YOUR MIND TO IT AS ONE OF THE HARDSHIPS WHICH
FALL TO EVERY SAILOR'S SHARE, LIKE BAD WEATHER AND HARD LIVING, ONLY
WITH THIS ADVANTAGE, THAT THERE WILL BE AN END TO IT, THAT THERE WILL
COME A TIME WHEN YOU WILL HAVE NOTHING OF THAT SORT TO ENDURE. WHEN YOU
ARE A LIEUTENANT! ONLY THINK, WILLIAM, WHEN YOU ARE A LIEUTENANT, HOW
LITTLE YOU WILL CARE FOR ANY NONSENSE OF THIS KIND."

"I BEGIN TO THINK I SHALL NEVER BE A LIEUTENANT, FANNY. EVERYBODY GETS
MADE BUT ME."

"OH! MY DEAR WILLIAM, DO NOT TALK SO; DO NOT BE SO DESPONDING. MY UNCLE
SAYS NOTHING, BUT I AM SURE HE WILL DO EVERYTHING IN HIS POWER TO GET
YOU MADE. HE KNOWS, AS WELL AS YOU DO, OF WHAT CONSEQUENCE IT IS."

SHE WAS CHECKED BY THE SIGHT OF HER UNCLE MUCH NEARER TO THEM THAN SHE
HAD ANY SUSPICION OF, AND EACH FOUND IT NECESSARY TO TALK OF SOMETHING
ELSE.

"ARE YOU FOND OF DANCING, FANNY?"

"YES, VERY; ONLY I AM SOON TIRED."

"I SHOULD LIKE TO GO TO A BALL WITH YOU AND SEE YOU DANCE. HAVE YOU
NEVER ANY BALLS AT NORTHAMPTON? I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE YOU DANCE, AND I'D
DANCE WITH YOU IF YOU WOULD, FOR NOBODY WOULD KNOW WHO I WAS HERE,
AND I SHOULD LIKE TO BE YOUR PARTNER ONCE MORE. WE USED TO JUMP ABOUT
TOGETHER MANY A TIME, DID NOT WE? WHEN THE HAND-ORGAN WAS IN THE STREET?
I AM A PRETTY GOOD DANCER IN MY WAY, BUT I DARE SAY YOU ARE A BETTER."
AND TURNING TO HIS UNCLE, WHO WAS NOW CLOSE TO THEM, "IS NOT FANNY A
VERY GOOD DANCER, SIR?"

FANNY, IN DISMAY AT SUCH AN UNPRECEDENTED QUESTION, DID NOT KNOW WHICH
WAY TO LOOK, OR HOW TO BE PREPARED FOR THE ANSWER. SOME VERY GRAVE
REPROOF, OR AT LEAST THE COLDEST EXPRESSION OF INDIFFERENCE, MUST BE
COMING TO DISTRESS HER BROTHER, AND SINK HER TO THE GROUND. BUT, ON THE
CONTRARY, IT WAS NO WORSE THAN, "I AM SORRY TO SAY THAT I AM UNABLE
TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION. I HAVE NEVER SEEN FANNY DANCE SINCE SHE WAS A
LITTLE GIRL; BUT I TRUST WE SHALL BOTH THINK SHE ACQUITS HERSELF LIKE
A GENTLEWOMAN WHEN WE DO SEE HER, WHICH, PERHAPS, WE MAY HAVE AN
OPPORTUNITY OF DOING ERE LONG."

"I HAVE HAD THE PLEASURE OF SEEING YOUR SISTER DANCE, MR. PRICE,"
SAID HENRY CRAWFORD, LEANING FORWARD, "AND WILL ENGAGE TO ANSWER EVERY
INQUIRY WHICH YOU CAN MAKE ON THE SUBJECT, TO YOUR ENTIRE SATISFACTION.
BUT I BELIEVE" (SEEING FANNY LOOKED DISTRESSED) "IT MUST BE AT SOME
OTHER TIME. THERE IS ONE PERSON IN COMPANY WHO DOES NOT LIKE TO HAVE
MISS PRICE SPOKEN OF."

TRUE ENOUGH, HE HAD ONCE SEEN FANNY DANCE; AND IT WAS EQUALLY TRUE
THAT HE WOULD NOW HAVE ANSWERED FOR HER GLIDING ABOUT WITH QUIET, LIGHT
ELEGANCE, AND IN ADMIRABLE TIME; BUT, IN FACT, HE COULD NOT FOR THE LIFE
OF HIM RECALL WHAT HER DANCING HAD BEEN, AND RATHER TOOK IT FOR GRANTED
THAT SHE HAD BEEN PRESENT THAN REMEMBERED ANYTHING ABOUT HER.

HE PASSED, HOWEVER, FOR AN ADMIRER OF HER DANCING; AND SIR THOMAS, BY NO
MEANS DISPLEASED, PROLONGED THE CONVERSATION ON DANCING IN GENERAL, AND
WAS SO WELL ENGAGED IN DESCRIBING THE BALLS OF ANTIGUA, AND LISTENING TO
WHAT HIS NEPHEW COULD RELATE OF THE DIFFERENT MODES OF DANCING WHICH
HAD FALLEN WITHIN HIS OBSERVATION, THAT HE HAD NOT HEARD HIS CARRIAGE
ANNOUNCED, AND WAS FIRST CALLED TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF IT BY THE BUSTLE OF
MRS. NORRIS.

"COME, FANNY, FANNY, WHAT ARE YOU ABOUT? WE ARE GOING. DO NOT YOU SEE
YOUR AUNT IS GOING? QUICK, QUICK! I CANNOT BEAR TO KEEP GOOD OLD WILCOX
WAITING. YOU SHOULD ALWAYS REMEMBER THE COACHMAN AND HORSES. MY DEAR SIR
THOMAS, WE HAVE SETTLED IT THAT THE CARRIAGE SHOULD COME BACK FOR YOU,
AND EDMUND AND WILLIAM."

SIR THOMAS COULD NOT DISSENT, AS IT HAD BEEN HIS OWN ARRANGEMENT,
PREVIOUSLY COMMUNICATED TO HIS WIFE AND SISTER; BUT THAT SEEMED
FORGOTTEN BY MRS. NORRIS, WHO MUST FANCY THAT SHE SETTLED IT ALL
HERSELF.

FANNY'S LAST FEELING IN THE VISIT WAS DISAPPOINTMENT: FOR THE SHAWL
WHICH EDMUND WAS QUIETLY TAKING FROM THE SERVANT TO BRING AND PUT ROUND
HER SHOULDERS WAS SEIZED BY MR. CRAWFORD'S QUICKER HAND, AND SHE WAS
OBLIGED TO BE INDEBTED TO HIS MORE PROMINENT ATTENTION.



CHAPTER XXVI

WILLIAM'S DESIRE OF SEEING FANNY DANCE MADE MORE THAN A MOMENTARY
IMPRESSION ON HIS UNCLE. THE HOPE OF AN OPPORTUNITY, WHICH SIR THOMAS
HAD THEN GIVEN, WAS NOT GIVEN TO BE THOUGHT OF NO MORE. HE REMAINED
STEADILY INCLINED TO GRATIFY SO AMIABLE A FEELING; TO GRATIFY ANYBODY
ELSE WHO MIGHT WISH TO SEE FANNY DANCE, AND TO GIVE PLEASURE TO THE
YOUNG PEOPLE IN GENERAL; AND HAVING THOUGHT THE MATTER OVER, AND TAKEN
HIS RESOLUTION IN QUIET INDEPENDENCE, THE RESULT OF IT APPEARED THE
NEXT MORNING AT BREAKFAST, WHEN, AFTER RECALLING AND COMMENDING WHAT
HIS NEPHEW HAD SAID, HE ADDED, "I DO NOT LIKE, WILLIAM, THAT YOU
SHOULD LEAVE NORTHAMPTONSHIRE WITHOUT THIS INDULGENCE. IT WOULD GIVE ME
PLEASURE TO SEE YOU BOTH DANCE. YOU SPOKE OF THE BALLS AT NORTHAMPTON.
YOUR COUSINS HAVE OCCASIONALLY ATTENDED THEM; BUT THEY WOULD NOT
ALTOGETHER SUIT US NOW. THE FATIGUE WOULD BE TOO MUCH FOR YOUR AUNT. I
BELIEVE WE MUST NOT THINK OF A NORTHAMPTON BALL. A DANCE AT HOME WOULD
BE MORE ELIGIBLE; AND IF--"

"AH, MY DEAR SIR THOMAS!" INTERRUPTED MRS. NORRIS, "I KNEW WHAT WAS
COMING. I KNEW WHAT YOU WERE GOING TO SAY. IF DEAR JULIA WERE AT HOME,
OR DEAREST MRS. RUSHWORTH AT SOTHERTON, TO AFFORD A REASON, AN OCCASION
FOR SUCH A THING, YOU WOULD BE TEMPTED TO GIVE THE YOUNG PEOPLE A DANCE
AT MANSFIELD. I KNOW YOU WOULD. IF THEY WERE AT HOME TO GRACE THE
BALL, A BALL YOU WOULD HAVE THIS VERY CHRISTMAS. THANK YOUR UNCLE,
WILLIAM, THANK YOUR UNCLE!"

"MY DAUGHTERS," REPLIED SIR THOMAS, GRAVELY INTERPOSING, "HAVE THEIR
PLEASURES AT BRIGHTON, AND I HOPE ARE VERY HAPPY; BUT THE DANCE WHICH I
THINK OF GIVING AT MANSFIELD WILL BE FOR THEIR COUSINS. COULD WE BE ALL
ASSEMBLED, OUR SATISFACTION WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY BE MORE COMPLETE, BUT THE
ABSENCE OF SOME IS NOT TO DEBAR THE OTHERS OF AMUSEMENT."

MRS. NORRIS HAD NOT ANOTHER WORD TO SAY. SHE SAW DECISION IN HIS LOOKS,
AND HER SURPRISE AND VEXATION REQUIRED SOME MINUTES' SILENCE TO BE
SETTLED INTO COMPOSURE. A BALL AT SUCH A TIME! HIS DAUGHTERS ABSENT AND
HERSELF NOT CONSULTED! THERE WAS COMFORT, HOWEVER, SOON AT HAND. SHE
MUST BE THE DOER OF EVERYTHING: LADY BERTRAM WOULD OF COURSE BE SPARED
ALL THOUGHT AND EXERTION, AND IT WOULD ALL FALL UPON HER. SHE SHOULD
HAVE TO DO THE HONOURS OF THE EVENING; AND THIS REFLECTION QUICKLY
RESTORED SO MUCH OF HER GOOD-HUMOUR AS ENABLED HER TO JOIN IN WITH THE
OTHERS, BEFORE THEIR HAPPINESS AND THANKS WERE ALL EXPRESSED.

EDMUND, WILLIAM, AND FANNY DID, IN THEIR DIFFERENT WAYS, LOOK AND SPEAK
AS MUCH GRATEFUL PLEASURE IN THE PROMISED BALL AS SIR THOMAS COULD
DESIRE. EDMUND'S FEELINGS WERE FOR THE OTHER TWO. HIS FATHER HAD NEVER
CONFERRED A FAVOUR OR SHEWN A KINDNESS MORE TO HIS SATISFACTION.

LADY BERTRAM WAS PERFECTLY QUIESCENT AND CONTENTED, AND HAD NO
OBJECTIONS TO MAKE. SIR THOMAS ENGAGED FOR ITS GIVING HER VERY LITTLE
TROUBLE; AND SHE ASSURED HIM "THAT SHE WAS NOT AT ALL AFRAID OF THE
TROUBLE; INDEED, SHE COULD NOT IMAGINE THERE WOULD BE ANY."

MRS. NORRIS WAS READY WITH HER SUGGESTIONS AS TO THE ROOMS HE WOULD
THINK FITTEST TO BE USED, BUT FOUND IT ALL PREARRANGED; AND WHEN SHE
WOULD HAVE CONJECTURED AND HINTED ABOUT THE DAY, IT APPEARED THAT THE
DAY WAS SETTLED TOO. SIR THOMAS HAD BEEN AMUSING HIMSELF WITH SHAPING A
VERY COMPLETE OUTLINE OF THE BUSINESS; AND AS SOON AS SHE WOULD LISTEN
QUIETLY, COULD READ HIS LIST OF THE FAMILIES TO BE INVITED, FROM WHOM
HE CALCULATED, WITH ALL NECESSARY ALLOWANCE FOR THE SHORTNESS OF THE
NOTICE, TO COLLECT YOUNG PEOPLE ENOUGH TO FORM TWELVE OR FOURTEEN
COUPLE: AND COULD DETAIL THE CONSIDERATIONS WHICH HAD INDUCED HIM TO
FIX ON THE 22ND AS THE MOST ELIGIBLE DAY. WILLIAM WAS REQUIRED TO BE AT
PORTSMOUTH ON THE 24TH; THE 22ND WOULD THEREFORE BE THE LAST DAY OF HIS
VISIT; BUT WHERE THE DAYS WERE SO FEW IT WOULD BE UNWISE TO FIX ON ANY
EARLIER. MRS. NORRIS WAS OBLIGED TO BE SATISFIED WITH THINKING JUST THE
SAME, AND WITH HAVING BEEN ON THE POINT OF PROPOSING THE 22ND HERSELF,
AS BY FAR THE BEST DAY FOR THE PURPOSE.

THE BALL WAS NOW A SETTLED THING, AND BEFORE THE EVENING A PROCLAIMED
THING TO ALL WHOM IT CONCERNED. INVITATIONS WERE SENT WITH DESPATCH,
AND MANY A YOUNG LADY WENT TO BED THAT NIGHT WITH HER HEAD FULL OF HAPPY
CARES AS WELL AS FANNY. TO HER THE CARES WERE SOMETIMES ALMOST BEYOND
THE HAPPINESS; FOR YOUNG AND INEXPERIENCED, WITH SMALL MEANS OF CHOICE
AND NO CONFIDENCE IN HER OWN TASTE, THE "HOW SHE SHOULD BE DRESSED" WAS
A POINT OF PAINFUL SOLICITUDE; AND THE ALMOST SOLITARY ORNAMENT IN HER
POSSESSION, A VERY PRETTY AMBER CROSS WHICH WILLIAM HAD BROUGHT HER FROM
SICILY, WAS THE GREATEST DISTRESS OF ALL, FOR SHE HAD NOTHING BUT A BIT
OF RIBBON TO FASTEN IT TO; AND THOUGH SHE HAD WORN IT IN THAT MANNER
ONCE, WOULD IT BE ALLOWABLE AT SUCH A TIME IN THE MIDST OF ALL THE RICH
ORNAMENTS WHICH SHE SUPPOSED ALL THE OTHER YOUNG LADIES WOULD APPEAR IN?
AND YET NOT TO WEAR IT! WILLIAM HAD WANTED TO BUY HER A GOLD CHAIN TOO,
BUT THE PURCHASE HAD BEEN BEYOND HIS MEANS, AND THEREFORE NOT TO WEAR
THE CROSS MIGHT BE MORTIFYING HIM. THESE WERE ANXIOUS CONSIDERATIONS;
ENOUGH TO SOBER HER SPIRITS EVEN UNDER THE PROSPECT OF A BALL GIVEN
PRINCIPALLY FOR HER GRATIFICATION.

THE PREPARATIONS MEANWHILE WENT ON, AND LADY BERTRAM CONTINUED TO SIT ON
HER SOFA WITHOUT ANY INCONVENIENCE FROM THEM. SHE HAD SOME EXTRA VISITS
FROM THE HOUSEKEEPER, AND HER MAID WAS RATHER HURRIED IN MAKING UP A NEW
DRESS FOR HER: SIR THOMAS GAVE ORDERS, AND MRS. NORRIS RAN ABOUT; BUT
ALL THIS GAVE HER NO TROUBLE, AND AS SHE HAD FORESEEN, "THERE WAS, IN
FACT, NO TROUBLE IN THE BUSINESS."

EDMUND WAS AT THIS TIME PARTICULARLY FULL OF CARES: HIS MIND BEING
DEEPLY OCCUPIED IN THE CONSIDERATION OF TWO IMPORTANT EVENTS NOW
AT HAND, WHICH WERE TO FIX HIS FATE IN LIFE--ORDINATION AND
MATRIMONY--EVENTS OF SUCH A SERIOUS CHARACTER AS TO MAKE THE BALL, WHICH
WOULD BE VERY QUICKLY FOLLOWED BY ONE OF THEM, APPEAR OF LESS MOMENT IN
HIS EYES THAN IN THOSE OF ANY OTHER PERSON IN THE HOUSE. ON THE 23RD
HE WAS GOING TO A FRIEND NEAR PETERBOROUGH, IN THE SAME SITUATION
AS HIMSELF, AND THEY WERE TO RECEIVE ORDINATION IN THE COURSE OF THE
CHRISTMAS WEEK. HALF HIS DESTINY WOULD THEN BE DETERMINED, BUT THE
OTHER HALF MIGHT NOT BE SO VERY SMOOTHLY WOOED. HIS DUTIES WOULD BE
ESTABLISHED, BUT THE WIFE WHO WAS TO SHARE, AND ANIMATE, AND REWARD
THOSE DUTIES, MIGHT YET BE UNATTAINABLE. HE KNEW HIS OWN MIND, BUT HE
WAS NOT ALWAYS PERFECTLY ASSURED OF KNOWING MISS CRAWFORD'S. THERE WERE
POINTS ON WHICH THEY DID NOT QUITE AGREE; THERE WERE MOMENTS IN WHICH
SHE DID NOT SEEM PROPITIOUS; AND THOUGH TRUSTING ALTOGETHER TO HER
AFFECTION, SO FAR AS TO BE RESOLVED--ALMOST RESOLVED--ON BRINGING IT TO
A DECISION WITHIN A VERY SHORT TIME, AS SOON AS THE VARIETY OF BUSINESS
BEFORE HIM WERE ARRANGED, AND HE KNEW WHAT HE HAD TO OFFER HER, HE
HAD MANY ANXIOUS FEELINGS, MANY DOUBTING HOURS AS TO THE RESULT. HIS
CONVICTION OF HER REGARD FOR HIM WAS SOMETIMES VERY STRONG; HE COULD
LOOK BACK ON A LONG COURSE OF ENCOURAGEMENT, AND SHE WAS AS PERFECT IN
DISINTERESTED ATTACHMENT AS IN EVERYTHING ELSE. BUT AT OTHER TIMES
DOUBT AND ALARM INTERMINGLED WITH HIS HOPES; AND WHEN HE THOUGHT OF
HER ACKNOWLEDGED DISINCLINATION FOR PRIVACY AND RETIREMENT, HER DECIDED
PREFERENCE OF A LONDON LIFE, WHAT COULD HE EXPECT BUT A DETERMINED
REJECTION? UNLESS IT WERE AN ACCEPTANCE EVEN MORE TO BE DEPRECATED,
DEMANDING SUCH SACRIFICES OF SITUATION AND EMPLOYMENT ON HIS SIDE AS
CONSCIENCE MUST FORBID.

THE ISSUE OF ALL DEPENDED ON ONE QUESTION. DID SHE LOVE HIM WELL ENOUGH
TO FOREGO WHAT HAD USED TO BE ESSENTIAL POINTS? DID SHE LOVE HIM WELL
ENOUGH TO MAKE THEM NO LONGER ESSENTIAL? AND THIS QUESTION, WHICH HE WAS
CONTINUALLY REPEATING TO HIMSELF, THOUGH OFTENEST ANSWERED WITH A "YES,"
HAD SOMETIMES ITS "NO."

MISS CRAWFORD WAS SOON TO LEAVE MANSFIELD, AND ON THIS CIRCUMSTANCE THE
"NO" AND THE "YES" HAD BEEN VERY RECENTLY IN ALTERNATION. HE HAD SEEN
HER EYES SPARKLE AS SHE SPOKE OF THE DEAR FRIEND'S LETTER, WHICH CLAIMED
A LONG VISIT FROM HER IN LONDON, AND OF THE KINDNESS OF HENRY, IN
ENGAGING TO REMAIN WHERE HE WAS TILL JANUARY, THAT HE MIGHT CONVEY HER
THITHER; HE HAD HEARD HER SPEAK OF THE PLEASURE OF SUCH A JOURNEY WITH
AN ANIMATION WHICH HAD "NO" IN EVERY TONE. BUT THIS HAD OCCURRED ON THE
FIRST DAY OF ITS BEING SETTLED, WITHIN THE FIRST HOUR OF THE BURST OF
SUCH ENJOYMENT, WHEN NOTHING BUT THE FRIENDS SHE WAS TO VISIT WAS BEFORE
HER. HE HAD SINCE HEARD HER EXPRESS HERSELF DIFFERENTLY, WITH OTHER
FEELINGS, MORE CHEQUERED FEELINGS: HE HAD HEARD HER TELL MRS. GRANT THAT
SHE SHOULD LEAVE HER WITH REGRET; THAT SHE BEGAN TO BELIEVE NEITHER THE
FRIENDS NOR THE PLEASURES SHE WAS GOING TO WERE WORTH THOSE SHE LEFT
BEHIND; AND THAT THOUGH SHE FELT SHE MUST GO, AND KNEW SHE SHOULD ENJOY
HERSELF WHEN ONCE AWAY, SHE WAS ALREADY LOOKING FORWARD TO BEING AT
MANSFIELD AGAIN. WAS THERE NOT A "YES" IN ALL THIS?

WITH SUCH MATTERS TO PONDER OVER, AND ARRANGE, AND RE-ARRANGE, EDMUND
COULD NOT, ON HIS OWN ACCOUNT, THINK VERY MUCH OF THE EVENING WHICH THE
REST OF THE FAMILY WERE LOOKING FORWARD TO WITH A MORE EQUAL DEGREE OF
STRONG INTEREST. INDEPENDENT OF HIS TWO COUSINS' ENJOYMENT IN IT, THE
EVENING WAS TO HIM OF NO HIGHER VALUE THAN ANY OTHER APPOINTED MEETING
OF THE TWO FAMILIES MIGHT BE. IN EVERY MEETING THERE WAS A HOPE OF
RECEIVING FARTHER CONFIRMATION OF MISS CRAWFORD'S ATTACHMENT; BUT THE
WHIRL OF A BALLROOM, PERHAPS, WAS NOT PARTICULARLY FAVOURABLE TO THE
EXCITEMENT OR EXPRESSION OF SERIOUS FEELINGS. TO ENGAGE HER EARLY FOR
THE TWO FIRST DANCES WAS ALL THE COMMAND OF INDIVIDUAL HAPPINESS WHICH
HE FELT IN HIS POWER, AND THE ONLY PREPARATION FOR THE BALL WHICH HE
COULD ENTER INTO, IN SPITE OF ALL THAT WAS PASSING AROUND HIM ON THE
SUBJECT, FROM MORNING TILL NIGHT.

THURSDAY WAS THE DAY OF THE BALL; AND ON WEDNESDAY MORNING FANNY, STILL
UNABLE TO SATISFY HERSELF AS TO WHAT SHE OUGHT TO WEAR, DETERMINED TO
SEEK THE COUNSEL OF THE MORE ENLIGHTENED, AND APPLY TO MRS. GRANT AND
HER SISTER, WHOSE ACKNOWLEDGED TASTE WOULD CERTAINLY BEAR HER BLAMELESS;
AND AS EDMUND AND WILLIAM WERE GONE TO NORTHAMPTON, AND SHE HAD REASON
TO THINK MR. CRAWFORD LIKEWISE OUT, SHE WALKED DOWN TO THE PARSONAGE
WITHOUT MUCH FEAR OF WANTING AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PRIVATE DISCUSSION;
AND THE PRIVACY OF SUCH A DISCUSSION WAS A MOST IMPORTANT PART OF IT TO
FANNY, BEING MORE THAN HALF-ASHAMED OF HER OWN SOLICITUDE.

SHE MET MISS CRAWFORD WITHIN A FEW YARDS OF THE PARSONAGE, JUST SETTING
OUT TO CALL ON HER, AND AS IT SEEMED TO HER THAT HER FRIEND, THOUGH
OBLIGED TO INSIST ON TURNING BACK, WAS UNWILLING TO LOSE HER WALK, SHE
EXPLAINED HER BUSINESS AT ONCE, AND OBSERVED, THAT IF SHE WOULD BE SO
KIND AS TO GIVE HER OPINION, IT MIGHT BE ALL TALKED OVER AS WELL WITHOUT
DOORS AS WITHIN. MISS CRAWFORD APPEARED GRATIFIED BY THE APPLICATION,
AND AFTER A MOMENT'S THOUGHT, URGED FANNY'S RETURNING WITH HER IN A MUCH
MORE CORDIAL MANNER THAN BEFORE, AND PROPOSED THEIR GOING UP INTO HER
ROOM, WHERE THEY MIGHT HAVE A COMFORTABLE COZE, WITHOUT DISTURBING DR.
AND MRS. GRANT, WHO WERE TOGETHER IN THE DRAWING-ROOM. IT WAS JUST THE
PLAN TO SUIT FANNY; AND WITH A GREAT DEAL OF GRATITUDE ON HER SIDE FOR
SUCH READY AND KIND ATTENTION, THEY PROCEEDED INDOORS, AND UPSTAIRS, AND
WERE SOON DEEP IN THE INTERESTING SUBJECT. MISS CRAWFORD, PLEASED WITH
THE APPEAL, GAVE HER ALL HER BEST JUDGMENT AND TASTE, MADE EVERYTHING
EASY BY HER SUGGESTIONS, AND TRIED TO MAKE EVERYTHING AGREEABLE BY HER
ENCOURAGEMENT. THE DRESS BEING SETTLED IN ALL ITS GRANDER PARTS--"BUT
WHAT SHALL YOU HAVE BY WAY OF NECKLACE?" SAID MISS CRAWFORD. "SHALL NOT
YOU WEAR YOUR BROTHER'S CROSS?" AND AS SHE SPOKE SHE WAS UNDOING A
SMALL PARCEL, WHICH FANNY HAD OBSERVED IN HER HAND WHEN THEY MET. FANNY
ACKNOWLEDGED HER WISHES AND DOUBTS ON THIS POINT: SHE DID NOT KNOW
HOW EITHER TO WEAR THE CROSS, OR TO REFRAIN FROM WEARING IT. SHE WAS
ANSWERED BY HAVING A SMALL TRINKET-BOX PLACED BEFORE HER, AND BEING
REQUESTED TO CHUSE FROM AMONG SEVERAL GOLD CHAINS AND NECKLACES. SUCH
HAD BEEN THE PARCEL WITH WHICH MISS CRAWFORD WAS PROVIDED, AND SUCH THE
OBJECT OF HER INTENDED VISIT: AND IN THE KINDEST MANNER SHE NOW URGED
FANNY'S TAKING ONE FOR THE CROSS AND TO KEEP FOR HER SAKE, SAYING
EVERYTHING SHE COULD THINK OF TO OBVIATE THE SCRUPLES WHICH WERE MAKING
FANNY START BACK AT FIRST WITH A LOOK OF HORROR AT THE PROPOSAL.

"YOU SEE WHAT A COLLECTION I HAVE," SAID SHE; "MORE BY HALF THAN I EVER
USE OR THINK OF. I DO NOT OFFER THEM AS NEW. I OFFER NOTHING BUT AN OLD
NECKLACE. YOU MUST FORGIVE THE LIBERTY, AND OBLIGE ME."

FANNY STILL RESISTED, AND FROM HER HEART. THE GIFT WAS TOO VALUABLE. BUT
MISS CRAWFORD PERSEVERED, AND ARGUED THE CASE WITH SO MUCH AFFECTIONATE
EARNESTNESS THROUGH ALL THE HEADS OF WILLIAM AND THE CROSS, AND THE
BALL, AND HERSELF, AS TO BE FINALLY SUCCESSFUL. FANNY FOUND
HERSELF OBLIGED TO YIELD, THAT SHE MIGHT NOT BE ACCUSED OF PRIDE
OR INDIFFERENCE, OR SOME OTHER LITTLENESS; AND HAVING WITH MODEST
RELUCTANCE GIVEN HER CONSENT, PROCEEDED TO MAKE THE SELECTION. SHE
LOOKED AND LOOKED, LONGING TO KNOW WHICH MIGHT BE LEAST VALUABLE; AND
WAS DETERMINED IN HER CHOICE AT LAST, BY FANCYING THERE WAS ONE NECKLACE
MORE FREQUENTLY PLACED BEFORE HER EYES THAN THE REST. IT WAS OF GOLD,
PRETTILY WORKED; AND THOUGH FANNY WOULD HAVE PREFERRED A LONGER AND A
PLAINER CHAIN AS MORE ADAPTED FOR HER PURPOSE, SHE HOPED, IN FIXING
ON THIS, TO BE CHUSING WHAT MISS CRAWFORD LEAST WISHED TO KEEP. MISS
CRAWFORD SMILED HER PERFECT APPROBATION; AND HASTENED TO COMPLETE THE
GIFT BY PUTTING THE NECKLACE ROUND HER, AND MAKING HER SEE HOW WELL
IT LOOKED. FANNY HAD NOT A WORD TO SAY AGAINST ITS BECOMINGNESS, AND,
EXCEPTING WHAT REMAINED OF HER SCRUPLES, WAS EXCEEDINGLY PLEASED WITH
AN ACQUISITION SO VERY APROPOS. SHE WOULD RATHER, PERHAPS, HAVE BEEN
OBLIGED TO SOME OTHER PERSON. BUT THIS WAS AN UNWORTHY FEELING. MISS
CRAWFORD HAD ANTICIPATED HER WANTS WITH A KINDNESS WHICH PROVED HER A
REAL FRIEND. "WHEN I WEAR THIS NECKLACE I SHALL ALWAYS THINK OF YOU,"
SAID SHE, "AND FEEL HOW VERY KIND YOU WERE."

"YOU MUST THINK OF SOMEBODY ELSE TOO, WHEN YOU WEAR THAT NECKLACE,"
REPLIED MISS CRAWFORD. "YOU MUST THINK OF HENRY, FOR IT WAS HIS CHOICE
IN THE FIRST PLACE. HE GAVE IT TO ME, AND WITH THE NECKLACE I MAKE OVER
TO YOU ALL THE DUTY OF REMEMBERING THE ORIGINAL GIVER. IT IS TO BE
A FAMILY REMEMBRANCER. THE SISTER IS NOT TO BE IN YOUR MIND WITHOUT
BRINGING THE BROTHER TOO."

FANNY, IN GREAT ASTONISHMENT AND CONFUSION, WOULD HAVE RETURNED THE
PRESENT INSTANTLY. TO TAKE WHAT HAD BEEN THE GIFT OF ANOTHER PERSON,
OF A BROTHER TOO, IMPOSSIBLE! IT MUST NOT BE! AND WITH AN EAGERNESS
AND EMBARRASSMENT QUITE DIVERTING TO HER COMPANION, SHE LAID DOWN THE
NECKLACE AGAIN ON ITS COTTON, AND SEEMED RESOLVED EITHER TO TAKE ANOTHER
OR NONE AT ALL. MISS CRAWFORD THOUGHT SHE HAD NEVER SEEN A PRETTIER
CONSCIOUSNESS. "MY DEAR CHILD," SAID SHE, LAUGHING, "WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID
OF? DO YOU THINK HENRY WILL CLAIM THE NECKLACE AS MINE, AND FANCY YOU
DID NOT COME HONESTLY BY IT? OR ARE YOU IMAGINING HE WOULD BE TOO MUCH
FLATTERED BY SEEING ROUND YOUR LOVELY THROAT AN ORNAMENT WHICH HIS MONEY
PURCHASED THREE YEARS AGO, BEFORE HE KNEW THERE WAS SUCH A THROAT IN THE
WORLD? OR PERHAPS"--LOOKING ARCHLY--"YOU SUSPECT A CONFEDERACY BETWEEN
US, AND THAT WHAT I AM NOW DOING IS WITH HIS KNOWLEDGE AND AT HIS
DESIRE?"

WITH THE DEEPEST BLUSHES FANNY PROTESTED AGAINST SUCH A THOUGHT.

"WELL, THEN," REPLIED MISS CRAWFORD MORE SERIOUSLY, BUT WITHOUT AT ALL
BELIEVING HER, "TO CONVINCE ME THAT YOU SUSPECT NO TRICK, AND ARE AS
UNSUSPICIOUS OF COMPLIMENT AS I HAVE ALWAYS FOUND YOU, TAKE THE NECKLACE
AND SAY NO MORE ABOUT IT. ITS BEING A GIFT OF MY BROTHER'S NEED NOT MAKE
THE SMALLEST DIFFERENCE IN YOUR ACCEPTING IT, AS I ASSURE YOU IT MAKES
NONE IN MY WILLINGNESS TO PART WITH IT. HE IS ALWAYS GIVING ME SOMETHING
OR OTHER. I HAVE SUCH INNUMERABLE PRESENTS FROM HIM THAT IT IS QUITE
IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO VALUE OR FOR HIM TO REMEMBER HALF. AND AS FOR THIS
NECKLACE, I DO NOT SUPPOSE I HAVE WORN IT SIX TIMES: IT IS VERY PRETTY,
BUT I NEVER THINK OF IT; AND THOUGH YOU WOULD BE MOST HEARTILY WELCOME
TO ANY OTHER IN MY TRINKET-BOX, YOU HAVE HAPPENED TO FIX ON THE VERY
ONE WHICH, IF I HAVE A CHOICE, I WOULD RATHER PART WITH AND SEE IN YOUR
POSSESSION THAN ANY OTHER. SAY NO MORE AGAINST IT, I ENTREAT YOU. SUCH A
TRIFLE IS NOT WORTH HALF SO MANY WORDS."

FANNY DARED NOT MAKE ANY FARTHER OPPOSITION; AND WITH RENEWED BUT LESS
HAPPY THANKS ACCEPTED THE NECKLACE AGAIN, FOR THERE WAS AN EXPRESSION IN
MISS CRAWFORD'S EYES WHICH SHE COULD NOT BE SATISFIED WITH.

IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HER TO BE INSENSIBLE OF MR. CRAWFORD'S CHANGE OF
MANNERS. SHE HAD LONG SEEN IT. HE EVIDENTLY TRIED TO PLEASE HER: HE WAS
GALLANT, HE WAS ATTENTIVE, HE WAS SOMETHING LIKE WHAT HE HAD BEEN TO HER
COUSINS: HE WANTED, SHE SUPPOSED, TO CHEAT HER OF HER TRANQUILLITY AS
HE HAD CHEATED THEM; AND WHETHER HE MIGHT NOT HAVE SOME CONCERN IN THIS
NECKLACE--SHE COULD NOT BE CONVINCED THAT HE HAD NOT, FOR MISS CRAWFORD,
COMPLAISANT AS A SISTER, WAS CARELESS AS A WOMAN AND A FRIEND.

REFLECTING AND DOUBTING, AND FEELING THAT THE POSSESSION OF WHAT SHE HAD
SO MUCH WISHED FOR DID NOT BRING MUCH SATISFACTION, SHE NOW WALKED
HOME AGAIN, WITH A CHANGE RATHER THAN A DIMINUTION OF CARES SINCE HER
TREADING THAT PATH BEFORE.



CHAPTER XXVII

ON REACHING HOME FANNY WENT IMMEDIATELY UPSTAIRS TO DEPOSIT THIS
UNEXPECTED ACQUISITION, THIS DOUBTFUL GOOD OF A NECKLACE, IN SOME
FAVOURITE BOX IN THE EAST ROOM, WHICH HELD ALL HER SMALLER TREASURES;
BUT ON OPENING THE DOOR, WHAT WAS HER SURPRISE TO FIND HER COUSIN EDMUND
THERE WRITING AT THE TABLE! SUCH A SIGHT HAVING NEVER OCCURRED BEFORE,
WAS ALMOST AS WONDERFUL AS IT WAS WELCOME.

"FANNY," SAID HE DIRECTLY, LEAVING HIS SEAT AND HIS PEN, AND MEETING HER
WITH SOMETHING IN HIS HAND, "I BEG YOUR PARDON FOR BEING HERE. I CAME
TO LOOK FOR YOU, AND AFTER WAITING A LITTLE WHILE IN HOPE OF YOUR COMING
IN, WAS MAKING USE OF YOUR INKSTAND TO EXPLAIN MY ERRAND. YOU WILL FIND
THE BEGINNING OF A NOTE TO YOURSELF; BUT I CAN NOW SPEAK MY BUSINESS,
WHICH IS MERELY TO BEG YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THIS LITTLE TRIFLE--A CHAIN
FOR WILLIAM'S CROSS. YOU OUGHT TO HAVE HAD IT A WEEK AGO, BUT THERE HAS
BEEN A DELAY FROM MY BROTHER'S NOT BEING IN TOWN BY SEVERAL DAYS SO SOON
AS I EXPECTED; AND I HAVE ONLY JUST NOW RECEIVED IT AT NORTHAMPTON. I
HOPE YOU WILL LIKE THE CHAIN ITSELF, FANNY. I ENDEAVOURED TO CONSULT THE
SIMPLICITY OF YOUR TASTE; BUT, AT ANY RATE, I KNOW YOU WILL BE KIND TO
MY INTENTIONS, AND CONSIDER IT, AS IT REALLY IS, A TOKEN OF THE LOVE OF
ONE OF YOUR OLDEST FRIENDS."

AND SO SAYING, HE WAS HURRYING AWAY, BEFORE FANNY, OVERPOWERED BY A
THOUSAND FEELINGS OF PAIN AND PLEASURE, COULD ATTEMPT TO SPEAK; BUT
QUICKENED BY ONE SOVEREIGN WISH, SHE THEN CALLED OUT, "OH! COUSIN, STOP
A MOMENT, PRAY STOP!"

HE TURNED BACK.

"I CANNOT ATTEMPT TO THANK YOU," SHE CONTINUED, IN A VERY AGITATED
MANNER; "THANKS ARE OUT OF THE QUESTION. I FEEL MUCH MORE THAN I CAN
POSSIBLY EXPRESS. YOUR GOODNESS IN THINKING OF ME IN SUCH A WAY IS
BEYOND--"

"IF THAT IS ALL YOU HAVE TO SAY, FANNY" SMILING AND TURNING AWAY AGAIN.

"NO, NO, IT IS NOT. I WANT TO CONSULT YOU."

ALMOST UNCONSCIOUSLY SHE HAD NOW UNDONE THE PARCEL HE HAD JUST PUT
INTO HER HAND, AND SEEING BEFORE HER, IN ALL THE NICENESS OF JEWELLERS'
PACKING, A PLAIN GOLD CHAIN, PERFECTLY SIMPLE AND NEAT, SHE COULD NOT
HELP BURSTING FORTH AGAIN, "OH, THIS IS BEAUTIFUL INDEED! THIS IS THE
VERY THING, PRECISELY WHAT I WISHED FOR! THIS IS THE ONLY ORNAMENT I
HAVE EVER HAD A DESIRE TO POSSESS. IT WILL EXACTLY SUIT MY CROSS. THEY
MUST AND SHALL BE WORN TOGETHER. IT COMES, TOO, IN SUCH AN ACCEPTABLE
MOMENT. OH, COUSIN, YOU DO NOT KNOW HOW ACCEPTABLE IT IS."

"MY DEAR FANNY, YOU FEEL THESE THINGS A GREAT DEAL TOO MUCH. I AM MOST
HAPPY THAT YOU LIKE THE CHAIN, AND THAT IT SHOULD BE HERE IN TIME FOR
TO-MORROW; BUT YOUR THANKS ARE FAR BEYOND THE OCCASION. BELIEVE ME, I
HAVE NO PLEASURE IN THE WORLD SUPERIOR TO THAT OF CONTRIBUTING TO YOURS.
NO, I CAN SAFELY SAY, I HAVE NO PLEASURE SO COMPLETE, SO UNALLOYED. IT
IS WITHOUT A DRAWBACK."

UPON SUCH EXPRESSIONS OF AFFECTION FANNY COULD HAVE LIVED AN HOUR
WITHOUT SAYING ANOTHER WORD; BUT EDMUND, AFTER WAITING A MOMENT, OBLIGED
HER TO BRING DOWN HER MIND FROM ITS HEAVENLY FLIGHT BY SAYING, "BUT WHAT
IS IT THAT YOU WANT TO CONSULT ME ABOUT?"

IT WAS ABOUT THE NECKLACE, WHICH SHE WAS NOW MOST EARNESTLY LONGING TO
RETURN, AND HOPED TO OBTAIN HIS APPROBATION OF HER DOING. SHE GAVE THE
HISTORY OF HER RECENT VISIT, AND NOW HER RAPTURES MIGHT WELL BE OVER;
FOR EDMUND WAS SO STRUCK WITH THE CIRCUMSTANCE, SO DELIGHTED WITH WHAT
MISS CRAWFORD HAD DONE, SO GRATIFIED BY SUCH A COINCIDENCE OF CONDUCT
BETWEEN THEM, THAT FANNY COULD NOT BUT ADMIT THE SUPERIOR POWER OF ONE
PLEASURE OVER HIS OWN MIND, THOUGH IT MIGHT HAVE ITS DRAWBACK. IT WAS
SOME TIME BEFORE SHE COULD GET HIS ATTENTION TO HER PLAN, OR ANY ANSWER
TO HER DEMAND OF HIS OPINION: HE WAS IN A REVERIE OF FOND REFLECTION,
UTTERING ONLY NOW AND THEN A FEW HALF-SENTENCES OF PRAISE; BUT WHEN
HE DID AWAKE AND UNDERSTAND, HE WAS VERY DECIDED IN OPPOSING WHAT SHE
WISHED.

"RETURN THE NECKLACE! NO, MY DEAR FANNY, UPON NO ACCOUNT. IT WOULD BE
MORTIFYING HER SEVERELY. THERE CAN HARDLY BE A MORE UNPLEASANT SENSATION
THAN THE HAVING ANYTHING RETURNED ON OUR HANDS WHICH WE HAVE GIVEN WITH
A REASONABLE HOPE OF ITS CONTRIBUTING TO THE COMFORT OF A FRIEND. WHY
SHOULD SHE LOSE A PLEASURE WHICH SHE HAS SHEWN HERSELF SO DESERVING OF?"

"IF IT HAD BEEN GIVEN TO ME IN THE FIRST INSTANCE," SAID FANNY, "I
SHOULD NOT HAVE THOUGHT OF RETURNING IT; BUT BEING HER BROTHER'S
PRESENT, IS NOT IT FAIR TO SUPPOSE THAT SHE WOULD RATHER NOT PART WITH
IT, WHEN IT IS NOT WANTED?"

"SHE MUST NOT SUPPOSE IT NOT WANTED, NOT ACCEPTABLE, AT LEAST: AND ITS
HAVING BEEN ORIGINALLY HER BROTHER'S GIFT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE; FOR AS
SHE WAS NOT PREVENTED FROM OFFERING, NOR YOU FROM TAKING IT ON THAT
ACCOUNT, IT OUGHT NOT TO PREVENT YOU FROM KEEPING IT. NO DOUBT IT IS
HANDSOMER THAN MINE, AND FITTER FOR A BALLROOM."

"NO, IT IS NOT HANDSOMER, NOT AT ALL HANDSOMER IN ITS WAY, AND, FOR
MY PURPOSE, NOT HALF SO FIT. THE CHAIN WILL AGREE WITH WILLIAM'S CROSS
BEYOND ALL COMPARISON BETTER THAN THE NECKLACE."

"FOR ONE NIGHT, FANNY, FOR ONLY ONE NIGHT, IF IT BE A SACRIFICE; I AM
SURE YOU WILL, UPON CONSIDERATION, MAKE THAT SACRIFICE RATHER THAN GIVE
PAIN TO ONE WHO HAS BEEN SO STUDIOUS OF YOUR COMFORT. MISS CRAWFORD'S
ATTENTIONS TO YOU HAVE BEEN--NOT MORE THAN YOU WERE JUSTLY ENTITLED
TO--I AM THE LAST PERSON TO THINK THAT COULD BE, BUT THEY HAVE BEEN
INVARIABLE; AND TO BE RETURNING THEM WITH WHAT MUST HAVE SOMETHING THE
AIR OF INGRATITUDE, THOUGH I KNOW IT COULD NEVER HAVE THE MEANING,
IS NOT IN YOUR NATURE, I AM SURE. WEAR THE NECKLACE, AS YOU ARE ENGAGED
TO DO, TO-MORROW EVENING, AND LET THE CHAIN, WHICH WAS NOT ORDERED WITH
ANY REFERENCE TO THE BALL, BE KEPT FOR COMMONER OCCASIONS. THIS IS MY
ADVICE. I WOULD NOT HAVE THE SHADOW OF A COOLNESS BETWEEN THE TWO WHOSE
INTIMACY I HAVE BEEN OBSERVING WITH THE GREATEST PLEASURE, AND IN WHOSE
CHARACTERS THERE IS SO MUCH GENERAL RESEMBLANCE IN TRUE GENEROSITY
AND NATURAL DELICACY AS TO MAKE THE FEW SLIGHT DIFFERENCES, RESULTING
PRINCIPALLY FROM SITUATION, NO REASONABLE HINDRANCE TO A PERFECT
FRIENDSHIP. I WOULD NOT HAVE THE SHADOW OF A COOLNESS ARISE," HE
REPEATED, HIS VOICE SINKING A LITTLE, "BETWEEN THE TWO DEAREST OBJECTS I
HAVE ON EARTH."

HE WAS GONE AS HE SPOKE; AND FANNY REMAINED TO TRANQUILLISE HERSELF AS
SHE COULD. SHE WAS ONE OF HIS TWO DEAREST--THAT MUST SUPPORT HER. BUT
THE OTHER: THE FIRST! SHE HAD NEVER HEARD HIM SPEAK SO OPENLY BEFORE,
AND THOUGH IT TOLD HER NO MORE THAN WHAT SHE HAD LONG PERCEIVED, IT WAS
A STAB, FOR IT TOLD OF HIS OWN CONVICTIONS AND VIEWS. THEY WERE
DECIDED. HE WOULD MARRY MISS CRAWFORD. IT WAS A STAB, IN SPITE OF EVERY
LONG-STANDING EXPECTATION; AND SHE WAS OBLIGED TO REPEAT AGAIN AND
AGAIN, THAT SHE WAS ONE OF HIS TWO DEAREST, BEFORE THE WORDS GAVE HER
ANY SENSATION. COULD SHE BELIEVE MISS CRAWFORD TO DESERVE HIM, IT WOULD
BE--OH, HOW DIFFERENT WOULD IT BE--HOW FAR MORE TOLERABLE! BUT HE WAS
DECEIVED IN HER: HE GAVE HER MERITS WHICH SHE HAD NOT; HER FAULTS WERE
WHAT THEY HAD EVER BEEN, BUT HE SAW THEM NO LONGER. TILL SHE HAD SHED
MANY TEARS OVER THIS DECEPTION, FANNY COULD NOT SUBDUE HER AGITATION;
AND THE DEJECTION WHICH FOLLOWED COULD ONLY BE RELIEVED BY THE INFLUENCE
OF FERVENT PRAYERS FOR HIS HAPPINESS.

IT WAS HER INTENTION, AS SHE FELT IT TO BE HER DUTY, TO TRY TO OVERCOME
ALL THAT WAS EXCESSIVE, ALL THAT BORDERED ON SELFISHNESS, IN HER
AFFECTION FOR EDMUND. TO CALL OR TO FANCY IT A LOSS, A DISAPPOINTMENT,
WOULD BE A PRESUMPTION FOR WHICH SHE HAD NOT WORDS STRONG ENOUGH TO
SATISFY HER OWN HUMILITY. TO THINK OF HIM AS MISS CRAWFORD MIGHT BE
JUSTIFIED IN THINKING, WOULD IN HER BE INSANITY. TO HER HE COULD BE
NOTHING UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES; NOTHING DEARER THAN A FRIEND. WHY DID
SUCH AN IDEA OCCUR TO HER EVEN ENOUGH TO BE REPROBATED AND FORBIDDEN? IT
OUGHT NOT TO HAVE TOUCHED ON THE CONFINES OF HER IMAGINATION. SHE WOULD
ENDEAVOUR TO BE RATIONAL, AND TO DESERVE THE RIGHT OF JUDGING OF MISS
CRAWFORD'S CHARACTER, AND THE PRIVILEGE OF TRUE SOLICITUDE FOR HIM BY A
SOUND INTELLECT AND AN HONEST HEART.

SHE HAD ALL THE HEROISM OF PRINCIPLE, AND WAS DETERMINED TO DO HER DUTY;
BUT HAVING ALSO MANY OF THE FEELINGS OF YOUTH AND NATURE, LET HER NOT
BE MUCH WONDERED AT, IF, AFTER MAKING ALL THESE GOOD RESOLUTIONS ON THE
SIDE OF SELF-GOVERNMENT, SHE SEIZED THE SCRAP OF PAPER ON WHICH EDMUND
HAD BEGUN WRITING TO HER, AS A TREASURE BEYOND ALL HER HOPES, AND
READING WITH THE TENDEREST EMOTION THESE WORDS, "MY VERY DEAR FANNY,
YOU MUST DO ME THE FAVOUR TO ACCEPT" LOCKED IT UP WITH THE CHAIN, AS THE
DEAREST PART OF THE GIFT. IT WAS THE ONLY THING APPROACHING TO A LETTER
WHICH SHE HAD EVER RECEIVED FROM HIM; SHE MIGHT NEVER RECEIVE ANOTHER;
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE THAT SHE EVER SHOULD RECEIVE ANOTHER SO PERFECTLY
GRATIFYING IN THE OCCASION AND THE STYLE. TWO LINES MORE PRIZED HAD
NEVER FALLEN FROM THE PEN OF THE MOST DISTINGUISHED AUTHOR--NEVER
MORE COMPLETELY BLESSED THE RESEARCHES OF THE FONDEST BIOGRAPHER. THE
ENTHUSIASM OF A WOMAN'S LOVE IS EVEN BEYOND THE BIOGRAPHER'S. TO HER,
THE HANDWRITING ITSELF, INDEPENDENT OF ANYTHING IT MAY CONVEY, IS A
BLESSEDNESS. NEVER WERE SUCH CHARACTERS CUT BY ANY OTHER HUMAN BEING AS
EDMUND'S COMMONEST HANDWRITING GAVE! THIS SPECIMEN, WRITTEN IN HASTE
AS IT WAS, HAD NOT A FAULT; AND THERE WAS A FELICITY IN THE FLOW OF THE
FIRST FOUR WORDS, IN THE ARRANGEMENT OF "MY VERY DEAR FANNY," WHICH SHE
COULD HAVE LOOKED AT FOR EVER.

HAVING REGULATED HER THOUGHTS AND COMFORTED HER FEELINGS BY THIS HAPPY
MIXTURE OF REASON AND WEAKNESS, SHE WAS ABLE IN DUE TIME TO GO DOWN
AND RESUME HER USUAL EMPLOYMENTS NEAR HER AUNT BERTRAM, AND PAY HER THE
USUAL OBSERVANCES WITHOUT ANY APPARENT WANT OF SPIRITS.

THURSDAY, PREDESTINED TO HOPE AND ENJOYMENT, CAME; AND OPENED WITH
MORE KINDNESS TO FANNY THAN SUCH SELF-WILLED, UNMANAGEABLE DAYS OFTEN
VOLUNTEER, FOR SOON AFTER BREAKFAST A VERY FRIENDLY NOTE WAS BROUGHT
FROM MR. CRAWFORD TO WILLIAM, STATING THAT AS HE FOUND HIMSELF OBLIGED
TO GO TO LONDON ON THE MORROW FOR A FEW DAYS, HE COULD NOT HELP TRYING
TO PROCURE A COMPANION; AND THEREFORE HOPED THAT IF WILLIAM COULD
MAKE UP HIS MIND TO LEAVE MANSFIELD HALF A DAY EARLIER THAN HAD BEEN
PROPOSED, HE WOULD ACCEPT A PLACE IN HIS CARRIAGE. MR. CRAWFORD MEANT TO
BE IN TOWN BY HIS UNCLE'S ACCUSTOMARY LATE DINNER-HOUR, AND WILLIAM
WAS INVITED TO DINE WITH HIM AT THE ADMIRAL'S. THE PROPOSAL WAS A VERY
PLEASANT ONE TO WILLIAM HIMSELF, WHO ENJOYED THE IDEA OF TRAVELLING POST
WITH FOUR HORSES, AND SUCH A GOOD-HUMOURED, AGREEABLE FRIEND; AND, IN
LIKENING IT TO GOING UP WITH DESPATCHES, WAS SAYING AT ONCE EVERYTHING
IN FAVOUR OF ITS HAPPINESS AND DIGNITY WHICH HIS IMAGINATION COULD
SUGGEST; AND FANNY, FROM A DIFFERENT MOTIVE, WAS EXCEEDINGLY PLEASED;
FOR THE ORIGINAL PLAN WAS THAT WILLIAM SHOULD GO UP BY THE MAIL FROM
NORTHAMPTON THE FOLLOWING NIGHT, WHICH WOULD NOT HAVE ALLOWED HIM AN
HOUR'S REST BEFORE HE MUST HAVE GOT INTO A PORTSMOUTH COACH; AND THOUGH
THIS OFFER OF MR. CRAWFORD'S WOULD ROB HER OF MANY HOURS OF HIS COMPANY,
SHE WAS TOO HAPPY IN HAVING WILLIAM SPARED FROM THE FATIGUE OF SUCH
A JOURNEY, TO THINK OF ANYTHING ELSE. SIR THOMAS APPROVED OF IT FOR
ANOTHER REASON. HIS NEPHEW'S INTRODUCTION TO ADMIRAL CRAWFORD MIGHT BE
OF SERVICE. THE ADMIRAL, HE BELIEVED, HAD INTEREST. UPON THE WHOLE, IT
WAS A VERY JOYOUS NOTE. FANNY'S SPIRITS LIVED ON IT HALF THE MORNING,
DERIVING SOME ACCESSION OF PLEASURE FROM ITS WRITER BEING HIMSELF TO GO
AWAY.

AS FOR THE BALL, SO NEAR AT HAND, SHE HAD TOO MANY AGITATIONS AND FEARS
TO HAVE HALF THE ENJOYMENT IN ANTICIPATION WHICH SHE OUGHT TO HAVE HAD,
OR MUST HAVE BEEN SUPPOSED TO HAVE BY THE MANY YOUNG LADIES LOOKING
FORWARD TO THE SAME EVENT IN SITUATIONS MORE AT EASE, BUT UNDER
CIRCUMSTANCES OF LESS NOVELTY, LESS INTEREST, LESS PECULIAR
GRATIFICATION, THAN WOULD BE ATTRIBUTED TO HER. MISS PRICE, KNOWN
ONLY BY NAME TO HALF THE PEOPLE INVITED, WAS NOW TO MAKE HER FIRST
APPEARANCE, AND MUST BE REGARDED AS THE QUEEN OF THE EVENING. WHO COULD
BE HAPPIER THAN MISS PRICE? BUT MISS PRICE HAD NOT BEEN BROUGHT UP TO
THE TRADE OF COMING OUT; AND HAD SHE KNOWN IN WHAT LIGHT THIS BALL
WAS, IN GENERAL, CONSIDERED RESPECTING HER, IT WOULD VERY MUCH HAVE
LESSENED HER COMFORT BY INCREASING THE FEARS SHE ALREADY HAD OF DOING
WRONG AND BEING LOOKED AT. TO DANCE WITHOUT MUCH OBSERVATION OR ANY
EXTRAORDINARY FATIGUE, TO HAVE STRENGTH AND PARTNERS FOR ABOUT HALF THE
EVENING, TO DANCE A LITTLE WITH EDMUND, AND NOT A GREAT DEAL WITH MR.
CRAWFORD, TO SEE WILLIAM ENJOY HIMSELF, AND BE ABLE TO KEEP AWAY
FROM HER AUNT NORRIS, WAS THE HEIGHT OF HER AMBITION, AND SEEMED TO
COMPREHEND HER GREATEST POSSIBILITY OF HAPPINESS. AS THESE WERE THE BEST
OF HER HOPES, THEY COULD NOT ALWAYS PREVAIL; AND IN THE COURSE OF A LONG
MORNING, SPENT PRINCIPALLY WITH HER TWO AUNTS, SHE WAS OFTEN UNDER THE
INFLUENCE OF MUCH LESS SANGUINE VIEWS. WILLIAM, DETERMINED TO MAKE THIS
LAST DAY A DAY OF THOROUGH ENJOYMENT, WAS OUT SNIPE-SHOOTING; EDMUND,
SHE HAD TOO MUCH REASON TO SUPPOSE, WAS AT THE PARSONAGE; AND LEFT
ALONE TO BEAR THE WORRYING OF MRS. NORRIS, WHO WAS CROSS BECAUSE THE
HOUSEKEEPER WOULD HAVE HER OWN WAY WITH THE SUPPER, AND WHOM SHE COULD
NOT AVOID THOUGH THE HOUSEKEEPER MIGHT, FANNY WAS WORN DOWN AT LAST TO
THINK EVERYTHING AN EVIL BELONGING TO THE BALL, AND WHEN SENT OFF WITH
A PARTING WORRY TO DRESS, MOVED AS LANGUIDLY TOWARDS HER OWN ROOM, AND
FELT AS INCAPABLE OF HAPPINESS AS IF SHE HAD BEEN ALLOWED NO SHARE IN
IT.

AS SHE WALKED SLOWLY UPSTAIRS SHE THOUGHT OF YESTERDAY; IT HAD BEEN
ABOUT THE SAME HOUR THAT SHE HAD RETURNED FROM THE PARSONAGE, AND
FOUND EDMUND IN THE EAST ROOM. "SUPPOSE I WERE TO FIND HIM THERE AGAIN
TO-DAY!" SAID SHE TO HERSELF, IN A FOND INDULGENCE OF FANCY.

"FANNY," SAID A VOICE AT THAT MOMENT NEAR HER. STARTING AND LOOKING UP,
SHE SAW, ACROSS THE LOBBY SHE HAD JUST REACHED, EDMUND HIMSELF, STANDING
AT THE HEAD OF A DIFFERENT STAIRCASE. HE CAME TOWARDS HER. "YOU LOOK
TIRED AND FAGGED, FANNY. YOU HAVE BEEN WALKING TOO FAR."

"NO, I HAVE NOT BEEN OUT AT ALL."

"THEN YOU HAVE HAD FATIGUES WITHIN DOORS, WHICH ARE WORSE. YOU HAD
BETTER HAVE GONE OUT."

FANNY, NOT LIKING TO COMPLAIN, FOUND IT EASIEST TO MAKE NO ANSWER; AND
THOUGH HE LOOKED AT HER WITH HIS USUAL KINDNESS, SHE BELIEVED HE HAD
SOON CEASED TO THINK OF HER COUNTENANCE. HE DID NOT APPEAR IN SPIRITS:
SOMETHING UNCONNECTED WITH HER WAS PROBABLY AMISS. THEY PROCEEDED
UPSTAIRS TOGETHER, THEIR ROOMS BEING ON THE SAME FLOOR ABOVE.

"I COME FROM DR. GRANT'S," SAID EDMUND PRESENTLY. "YOU MAY GUESS MY
ERRAND THERE, FANNY." AND HE LOOKED SO CONSCIOUS, THAT FANNY COULD THINK
BUT OF ONE ERRAND, WHICH TURNED HER TOO SICK FOR SPEECH. "I WISHED TO
ENGAGE MISS CRAWFORD FOR THE TWO FIRST DANCES," WAS THE EXPLANATION THAT
FOLLOWED, AND BROUGHT FANNY TO LIFE AGAIN, ENABLING HER, AS SHE FOUND
SHE WAS EXPECTED TO SPEAK, TO UTTER SOMETHING LIKE AN INQUIRY AS TO THE
RESULT.

"YES," HE ANSWERED, "SHE IS ENGAGED TO ME; BUT" (WITH A SMILE THAT DID
NOT SIT EASY) "SHE SAYS IT IS TO BE THE LAST TIME THAT SHE EVER WILL
DANCE WITH ME. SHE IS NOT SERIOUS. I THINK, I HOPE, I AM SURE SHE IS
NOT SERIOUS; BUT I WOULD RATHER NOT HEAR IT. SHE NEVER HAS DANCED WITH A
CLERGYMAN, SHE SAYS, AND SHE NEVER WILL. FOR MY OWN SAKE, I COULD WISH
THERE HAD BEEN NO BALL JUST AT--I MEAN NOT THIS VERY WEEK, THIS VERY
DAY; TO-MORROW I LEAVE HOME."

FANNY STRUGGLED FOR SPEECH, AND SAID, "I AM VERY SORRY THAT ANYTHING HAS
OCCURRED TO DISTRESS YOU. THIS OUGHT TO BE A DAY OF PLEASURE. MY UNCLE
MEANT IT SO."

"OH YES, YES! AND IT WILL BE A DAY OF PLEASURE. IT WILL ALL END RIGHT. I
AM ONLY VEXED FOR A MOMENT. IN FACT, IT IS NOT THAT I CONSIDER THE BALL
AS ILL-TIMED; WHAT DOES IT SIGNIFY? BUT, FANNY," STOPPING HER, BY TAKING
HER HAND, AND SPEAKING LOW AND SERIOUSLY, "YOU KNOW WHAT ALL THIS MEANS.
YOU SEE HOW IT IS; AND COULD TELL ME, PERHAPS BETTER THAN I COULD TELL
YOU, HOW AND WHY I AM VEXED. LET ME TALK TO YOU A LITTLE. YOU ARE A
KIND, KIND LISTENER. I HAVE BEEN PAINED BY HER MANNER THIS MORNING, AND
CANNOT GET THE BETTER OF IT. I KNOW HER DISPOSITION TO BE AS SWEET AND
FAULTLESS AS YOUR OWN, BUT THE INFLUENCE OF HER FORMER COMPANIONS
MAKES HER SEEM--GIVES TO HER CONVERSATION, TO HER PROFESSED OPINIONS,
SOMETIMES A TINGE OF WRONG. SHE DOES NOT THINK EVIL, BUT SHE SPEAKS
IT, SPEAKS IT IN PLAYFULNESS; AND THOUGH I KNOW IT TO BE PLAYFULNESS, IT
GRIEVES ME TO THE SOUL."

"THE EFFECT OF EDUCATION," SAID FANNY GENTLY.

EDMUND COULD NOT BUT AGREE TO IT. "YES, THAT UNCLE AND AUNT! THEY HAVE
INJURED THE FINEST MIND; FOR SOMETIMES, FANNY, I OWN TO YOU, IT DOES
APPEAR MORE THAN MANNER: IT APPEARS AS IF THE MIND ITSELF WAS TAINTED."

FANNY IMAGINED THIS TO BE AN APPEAL TO HER JUDGMENT, AND THEREFORE,
AFTER A MOMENT'S CONSIDERATION, SAID, "IF YOU ONLY WANT ME AS A
LISTENER, COUSIN, I WILL BE AS USEFUL AS I CAN; BUT I AM NOT QUALIFIED
FOR AN ADVISER. DO NOT ASK ADVICE OF ME. I AM NOT COMPETENT."

"YOU ARE RIGHT, FANNY, TO PROTEST AGAINST SUCH AN OFFICE, BUT YOU NEED
NOT BE AFRAID. IT IS A SUBJECT ON WHICH I SHOULD NEVER ASK ADVICE; IT
IS THE SORT OF SUBJECT ON WHICH IT HAD BETTER NEVER BE ASKED; AND FEW,
I IMAGINE, DO ASK IT, BUT WHEN THEY WANT TO BE INFLUENCED AGAINST THEIR
CONSCIENCE. I ONLY WANT TO TALK TO YOU."

"ONE THING MORE. EXCUSE THE LIBERTY; BUT TAKE CARE HOW YOU TALK TO ME.
DO NOT TELL ME ANYTHING NOW, WHICH HEREAFTER YOU MAY BE SORRY FOR. THE
TIME MAY COME--"

THE COLOUR RUSHED INTO HER CHEEKS AS SHE SPOKE.

"DEAREST FANNY!" CRIED EDMUND, PRESSING HER HAND TO HIS LIPS WITH
ALMOST AS MUCH WARMTH AS IF IT HAD BEEN MISS CRAWFORD'S, "YOU ARE ALL
CONSIDERATE THOUGHT! BUT IT IS UNNECESSARY HERE. THE TIME WILL NEVER
COME. NO SUCH TIME AS YOU ALLUDE TO WILL EVER COME. I BEGIN TO THINK IT
MOST IMPROBABLE: THE CHANCES GROW LESS AND LESS; AND EVEN IF IT SHOULD,
THERE WILL BE NOTHING TO BE REMEMBERED BY EITHER YOU OR ME THAT WE NEED
BE AFRAID OF, FOR I CAN NEVER BE ASHAMED OF MY OWN SCRUPLES; AND IF THEY
ARE REMOVED, IT MUST BE BY CHANGES THAT WILL ONLY RAISE HER CHARACTER
THE MORE BY THE RECOLLECTION OF THE FAULTS SHE ONCE HAD. YOU ARE THE
ONLY BEING UPON EARTH TO WHOM I SHOULD SAY WHAT I HAVE SAID; BUT YOU
HAVE ALWAYS KNOWN MY OPINION OF HER; YOU CAN BEAR ME WITNESS, FANNY,
THAT I HAVE NEVER BEEN BLINDED. HOW MANY A TIME HAVE WE TALKED OVER
HER LITTLE ERRORS! YOU NEED NOT FEAR ME; I HAVE ALMOST GIVEN UP EVERY
SERIOUS IDEA OF HER; BUT I MUST BE A BLOCKHEAD INDEED, IF, WHATEVER
BEFELL ME, I COULD THINK OF YOUR KINDNESS AND SYMPATHY WITHOUT THE
SINCEREST GRATITUDE."

HE HAD SAID ENOUGH TO SHAKE THE EXPERIENCE OF EIGHTEEN. HE HAD SAID
ENOUGH TO GIVE FANNY SOME HAPPIER FEELINGS THAN SHE HAD LATELY KNOWN,
AND WITH A BRIGHTER LOOK, SHE ANSWERED, "YES, COUSIN, I AM CONVINCED
THAT YOU WOULD BE INCAPABLE OF ANYTHING ELSE, THOUGH PERHAPS SOME
MIGHT NOT. I CANNOT BE AFRAID OF HEARING ANYTHING YOU WISH TO SAY. DO
NOT CHECK YOURSELF. TELL ME WHATEVER YOU LIKE."

THEY WERE NOW ON THE SECOND FLOOR, AND THE APPEARANCE OF A HOUSEMAID
PREVENTED ANY FARTHER CONVERSATION. FOR FANNY'S PRESENT COMFORT IT WAS
CONCLUDED, PERHAPS, AT THE HAPPIEST MOMENT: HAD HE BEEN ABLE TO TALK
ANOTHER FIVE MINUTES, THERE IS NO SAYING THAT HE MIGHT NOT HAVE TALKED
AWAY ALL MISS CRAWFORD'S FAULTS AND HIS OWN DESPONDENCE. BUT AS IT WAS,
THEY PARTED WITH LOOKS ON HIS SIDE OF GRATEFUL AFFECTION, AND WITH
SOME VERY PRECIOUS SENSATIONS ON HERS. SHE HAD FELT NOTHING LIKE IT FOR
HOURS. SINCE THE FIRST JOY FROM MR. CRAWFORD'S NOTE TO WILLIAM HAD WORN
AWAY, SHE HAD BEEN IN A STATE ABSOLUTELY THE REVERSE; THERE HAD BEEN
NO COMFORT AROUND, NO HOPE WITHIN HER. NOW EVERYTHING WAS SMILING.
WILLIAM'S GOOD FORTUNE RETURNED AGAIN UPON HER MIND, AND SEEMED OF
GREATER VALUE THAN AT FIRST. THE BALL, TOO--SUCH AN EVENING OF PLEASURE
BEFORE HER! IT WAS NOW A REAL ANIMATION; AND SHE BEGAN TO DRESS FOR IT
WITH MUCH OF THE HAPPY FLUTTER WHICH BELONGS TO A BALL. ALL WENT WELL:
SHE DID NOT DISLIKE HER OWN LOOKS; AND WHEN SHE CAME TO THE NECKLACES
AGAIN, HER GOOD FORTUNE SEEMED COMPLETE, FOR UPON TRIAL THE ONE GIVEN
HER BY MISS CRAWFORD WOULD BY NO MEANS GO THROUGH THE RING OF THE CROSS.
SHE HAD, TO OBLIGE EDMUND, RESOLVED TO WEAR IT; BUT IT WAS TOO LARGE FOR
THE PURPOSE. HIS, THEREFORE, MUST BE WORN; AND HAVING, WITH DELIGHTFUL
FEELINGS, JOINED THE CHAIN AND THE CROSS--THOSE MEMORIALS OF THE TWO
MOST BELOVED OF HER HEART, THOSE DEAREST TOKENS SO FORMED FOR EACH OTHER
BY EVERYTHING REAL AND IMAGINARY--AND PUT THEM ROUND HER NECK, AND SEEN
AND FELT HOW FULL OF WILLIAM AND EDMUND THEY WERE, SHE WAS ABLE, WITHOUT
AN EFFORT, TO RESOLVE ON WEARING MISS CRAWFORD'S NECKLACE TOO. SHE
ACKNOWLEDGED IT TO BE RIGHT. MISS CRAWFORD HAD A CLAIM; AND WHEN IT WAS
NO LONGER TO ENCROACH ON, TO INTERFERE WITH THE STRONGER CLAIMS, THE
TRUER KINDNESS OF ANOTHER, SHE COULD DO HER JUSTICE EVEN WITH PLEASURE
TO HERSELF. THE NECKLACE REALLY LOOKED VERY WELL; AND FANNY LEFT HER
ROOM AT LAST, COMFORTABLY SATISFIED WITH HERSELF AND ALL ABOUT HER.

HER AUNT BERTRAM HAD RECOLLECTED HER ON THIS OCCASION WITH AN UNUSUAL
DEGREE OF WAKEFULNESS. IT HAD REALLY OCCURRED TO HER, UNPROMPTED, THAT
FANNY, PREPARING FOR A BALL, MIGHT BE GLAD OF BETTER HELP THAN THE UPPER
HOUSEMAID'S, AND WHEN DRESSED HERSELF, SHE ACTUALLY SENT HER OWN MAID TO
ASSIST HER; TOO LATE, OF COURSE, TO BE OF ANY USE. MRS. CHAPMAN HAD JUST
REACHED THE ATTIC FLOOR, WHEN MISS PRICE CAME OUT OF HER ROOM COMPLETELY
DRESSED, AND ONLY CIVILITIES WERE NECESSARY; BUT FANNY FELT HER AUNT'S
ATTENTION ALMOST AS MUCH AS LADY BERTRAM OR MRS. CHAPMAN COULD DO
THEMSELVES.



CHAPTER XXVIII

HER UNCLE AND BOTH HER AUNTS WERE IN THE DRAWING-ROOM WHEN FANNY WENT
DOWN. TO THE FORMER SHE WAS AN INTERESTING OBJECT, AND HE SAW WITH
PLEASURE THE GENERAL ELEGANCE OF HER APPEARANCE, AND HER BEING IN
REMARKABLY GOOD LOOKS. THE NEATNESS AND PROPRIETY OF HER DRESS WAS ALL
THAT HE WOULD ALLOW HIMSELF TO COMMEND IN HER PRESENCE, BUT UPON HER
LEAVING THE ROOM AGAIN SOON AFTERWARDS, HE SPOKE OF HER BEAUTY WITH VERY
DECIDED PRAISE.

"YES," SAID LADY BERTRAM, "SHE LOOKS VERY WELL. I SENT CHAPMAN TO HER."

"LOOK WELL! OH, YES!" CRIED MRS. NORRIS, "SHE HAS GOOD REASON TO LOOK
WELL WITH ALL HER ADVANTAGES: BROUGHT UP IN THIS FAMILY AS SHE HAS BEEN,
WITH ALL THE BENEFIT OF HER COUSINS' MANNERS BEFORE HER. ONLY THINK, MY
DEAR SIR THOMAS, WHAT EXTRAORDINARY ADVANTAGES YOU AND I HAVE BEEN THE
MEANS OF GIVING HER. THE VERY GOWN YOU HAVE BEEN TAKING NOTICE OF IS
YOUR OWN GENEROUS PRESENT TO HER WHEN DEAR MRS. RUSHWORTH MARRIED. WHAT
WOULD SHE HAVE BEEN IF WE HAD NOT TAKEN HER BY THE HAND?"

SIR THOMAS SAID NO MORE; BUT WHEN THEY SAT DOWN TO TABLE THE EYES OF
THE TWO YOUNG MEN ASSURED HIM THAT THE SUBJECT MIGHT BE GENTLY TOUCHED
AGAIN, WHEN THE LADIES WITHDREW, WITH MORE SUCCESS. FANNY SAW THAT SHE
WAS APPROVED; AND THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF LOOKING WELL MADE HER LOOK STILL
BETTER. FROM A VARIETY OF CAUSES SHE WAS HAPPY, AND SHE WAS SOON MADE
STILL HAPPIER; FOR IN FOLLOWING HER AUNTS OUT OF THE ROOM, EDMUND, WHO
WAS HOLDING OPEN THE DOOR, SAID, AS SHE PASSED HIM, "YOU MUST DANCE
WITH ME, FANNY; YOU MUST KEEP TWO DANCES FOR ME; ANY TWO THAT YOU LIKE,
EXCEPT THE FIRST." SHE HAD NOTHING MORE TO WISH FOR. SHE HAD HARDLY
EVER BEEN IN A STATE SO NEARLY APPROACHING HIGH SPIRITS IN HER LIFE. HER
COUSINS' FORMER GAIETY ON THE DAY OF A BALL WAS NO LONGER SURPRISING TO
HER; SHE FELT IT TO BE INDEED VERY CHARMING, AND WAS ACTUALLY PRACTISING
HER STEPS ABOUT THE DRAWING-ROOM AS LONG AS SHE COULD BE SAFE FROM THE
NOTICE OF HER AUNT NORRIS, WHO WAS ENTIRELY TAKEN UP AT FIRST IN FRESH
ARRANGING AND INJURING THE NOBLE FIRE WHICH THE BUTLER HAD PREPARED.

HALF AN HOUR FOLLOWED THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN AT LEAST LANGUID UNDER ANY
OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES, BUT FANNY'S HAPPINESS STILL PREVAILED. IT WAS BUT
TO THINK OF HER CONVERSATION WITH EDMUND, AND WHAT WAS THE RESTLESSNESS
OF MRS. NORRIS? WHAT WERE THE YAWNS OF LADY BERTRAM?

THE GENTLEMEN JOINED THEM; AND SOON AFTER BEGAN THE SWEET EXPECTATION OF
A CARRIAGE, WHEN A GENERAL SPIRIT OF EASE AND ENJOYMENT SEEMED DIFFUSED,
AND THEY ALL STOOD ABOUT AND TALKED AND LAUGHED, AND EVERY MOMENT HAD
ITS PLEASURE AND ITS HOPE. FANNY FELT THAT THERE MUST BE A STRUGGLE
IN EDMUND'S CHEERFULNESS, BUT IT WAS DELIGHTFUL TO SEE THE EFFORT SO
SUCCESSFULLY MADE.

WHEN THE CARRIAGES WERE REALLY HEARD, WHEN THE GUESTS BEGAN REALLY TO
ASSEMBLE, HER OWN GAIETY OF HEART WAS MUCH SUBDUED: THE SIGHT OF SO
MANY STRANGERS THREW HER BACK INTO HERSELF; AND BESIDES THE GRAVITY AND
FORMALITY OF THE FIRST GREAT CIRCLE, WHICH THE MANNERS OF NEITHER SIR
THOMAS NOR LADY BERTRAM WERE OF A KIND TO DO AWAY, SHE FOUND HERSELF
OCCASIONALLY CALLED ON TO ENDURE SOMETHING WORSE. SHE WAS INTRODUCED
HERE AND THERE BY HER UNCLE, AND FORCED TO BE SPOKEN TO, AND TO CURTSEY,
AND SPEAK AGAIN. THIS WAS A HARD DUTY, AND SHE WAS NEVER SUMMONED TO
IT WITHOUT LOOKING AT WILLIAM, AS HE WALKED ABOUT AT HIS EASE IN THE
BACKGROUND OF THE SCENE, AND LONGING TO BE WITH HIM.

THE ENTRANCE OF THE GRANTS AND CRAWFORDS WAS A FAVOURABLE EPOCH. THE
STIFFNESS OF THE MEETING SOON GAVE WAY BEFORE THEIR POPULAR MANNERS AND
MORE DIFFUSED INTIMACIES: LITTLE GROUPS WERE FORMED, AND EVERYBODY GREW
COMFORTABLE. FANNY FELT THE ADVANTAGE; AND, DRAWING BACK FROM THE TOILS
OF CIVILITY, WOULD HAVE BEEN AGAIN MOST HAPPY, COULD SHE HAVE KEPT HER
EYES FROM WANDERING BETWEEN EDMUND AND MARY CRAWFORD. SHE LOOKED ALL
LOVELINESS--AND WHAT MIGHT NOT BE THE END OF IT? HER OWN MUSINGS
WERE BROUGHT TO AN END ON PERCEIVING MR. CRAWFORD BEFORE HER, AND
HER THOUGHTS WERE PUT INTO ANOTHER CHANNEL BY HIS ENGAGING HER ALMOST
INSTANTLY FOR THE FIRST TWO DANCES. HER HAPPINESS ON THIS OCCASION WAS
VERY MUCH A LA MORTAL, FINELY CHEQUERED. TO BE SECURE OF A PARTNER
AT FIRST WAS A MOST ESSENTIAL GOOD--FOR THE MOMENT OF BEGINNING WAS NOW
GROWING SERIOUSLY NEAR; AND SHE SO LITTLE UNDERSTOOD HER OWN CLAIMS AS
TO THINK THAT IF MR. CRAWFORD HAD NOT ASKED HER, SHE MUST HAVE BEEN THE
LAST TO BE SOUGHT AFTER, AND SHOULD HAVE RECEIVED A PARTNER ONLY THROUGH
A SERIES OF INQUIRY, AND BUSTLE, AND INTERFERENCE, WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN
TERRIBLE; BUT AT THE SAME TIME THERE WAS A POINTEDNESS IN HIS MANNER OF
ASKING HER WHICH SHE DID NOT LIKE, AND SHE SAW HIS EYE GLANCING FOR
A MOMENT AT HER NECKLACE, WITH A SMILE--SHE THOUGHT THERE WAS A
SMILE--WHICH MADE HER BLUSH AND FEEL WRETCHED. AND THOUGH THERE WAS NO
SECOND GLANCE TO DISTURB HER, THOUGH HIS OBJECT SEEMED THEN TO BE ONLY
QUIETLY AGREEABLE, SHE COULD NOT GET THE BETTER OF HER EMBARRASSMENT,
HEIGHTENED AS IT WAS BY THE IDEA OF HIS PERCEIVING IT, AND HAD NO
COMPOSURE TILL HE TURNED AWAY TO SOME ONE ELSE. THEN SHE COULD GRADUALLY
RISE UP TO THE GENUINE SATISFACTION OF HAVING A PARTNER, A VOLUNTARY
PARTNER, SECURED AGAINST THE DANCING BEGAN.

WHEN THE COMPANY WERE MOVING INTO THE BALLROOM, SHE FOUND HERSELF
FOR THE FIRST TIME NEAR MISS CRAWFORD, WHOSE EYES AND SMILES WERE
IMMEDIATELY AND MORE UNEQUIVOCALLY DIRECTED AS HER BROTHER'S HAD BEEN,
AND WHO WAS BEGINNING TO SPEAK ON THE SUBJECT, WHEN FANNY, ANXIOUS
TO GET THE STORY OVER, HASTENED TO GIVE THE EXPLANATION OF THE SECOND
NECKLACE: THE REAL CHAIN. MISS CRAWFORD LISTENED; AND ALL HER INTENDED
COMPLIMENTS AND INSINUATIONS TO FANNY WERE FORGOTTEN: SHE FELT ONLY ONE
THING; AND HER EYES, BRIGHT AS THEY HAD BEEN BEFORE, SHEWING THEY COULD
YET BE BRIGHTER, SHE EXCLAIMED WITH EAGER PLEASURE, "DID HE? DID EDMUND?
THAT WAS LIKE HIMSELF. NO OTHER MAN WOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF IT. I HONOUR
HIM BEYOND EXPRESSION." AND SHE LOOKED AROUND AS IF LONGING TO TELL HIM
SO. HE WAS NOT NEAR, HE WAS ATTENDING A PARTY OF LADIES OUT OF THE ROOM;
AND MRS. GRANT COMING UP TO THE TWO GIRLS, AND TAKING AN ARM OF EACH,
THEY FOLLOWED WITH THE REST.

FANNY'S HEART SUNK, BUT THERE WAS NO LEISURE FOR THINKING LONG EVEN OF
MISS CRAWFORD'S FEELINGS. THEY WERE IN THE BALLROOM, THE VIOLINS WERE
PLAYING, AND HER MIND WAS IN A FLUTTER THAT FORBADE ITS FIXING ON
ANYTHING SERIOUS. SHE MUST WATCH THE GENERAL ARRANGEMENTS, AND SEE HOW
EVERYTHING WAS DONE.

IN A FEW MINUTES SIR THOMAS CAME TO HER, AND ASKED IF SHE WERE ENGAGED;
AND THE "YES, SIR; TO MR. CRAWFORD," WAS EXACTLY WHAT HE HAD INTENDED
TO HEAR. MR. CRAWFORD WAS NOT FAR OFF; SIR THOMAS BROUGHT HIM TO HER,
SAYING SOMETHING WHICH DISCOVERED TO FANNY, THAT SHE WAS TO LEAD THE
WAY AND OPEN THE BALL; AN IDEA THAT HAD NEVER OCCURRED TO HER BEFORE.
WHENEVER SHE HAD THOUGHT OF THE MINUTIAE OF THE EVENING, IT HAD BEEN AS
A MATTER OF COURSE THAT EDMUND WOULD BEGIN WITH MISS CRAWFORD; AND THE
IMPRESSION WAS SO STRONG, THAT THOUGH HER UNCLE SPOKE THE CONTRARY,
SHE COULD NOT HELP AN EXCLAMATION OF SURPRISE, A HINT OF HER UNFITNESS,
AN ENTREATY EVEN TO BE EXCUSED. TO BE URGING HER OPINION AGAINST SIR
THOMAS'S WAS A PROOF OF THE EXTREMITY OF THE CASE; BUT SUCH WAS HER
HORROR AT THE FIRST SUGGESTION, THAT SHE COULD ACTUALLY LOOK HIM IN
THE FACE AND SAY THAT SHE HOPED IT MIGHT BE SETTLED OTHERWISE; IN VAIN,
HOWEVER: SIR THOMAS SMILED, TRIED TO ENCOURAGE HER, AND THEN LOOKED TOO
SERIOUS, AND SAID TOO DECIDEDLY, "IT MUST BE SO, MY DEAR," FOR HER TO
HAZARD ANOTHER WORD; AND SHE FOUND HERSELF THE NEXT MOMENT CONDUCTED BY
MR. CRAWFORD TO THE TOP OF THE ROOM, AND STANDING THERE TO BE JOINED BY
THE REST OF THE DANCERS, COUPLE AFTER COUPLE, AS THEY WERE FORMED.

SHE COULD HARDLY BELIEVE IT. TO BE PLACED ABOVE SO MANY ELEGANT YOUNG
WOMEN! THE DISTINCTION WAS TOO GREAT. IT WAS TREATING HER LIKE HER
COUSINS! AND HER THOUGHTS FLEW TO THOSE ABSENT COUSINS WITH MOST
UNFEIGNED AND TRULY TENDER REGRET, THAT THEY WERE NOT AT HOME TO TAKE
THEIR OWN PLACE IN THE ROOM, AND HAVE THEIR SHARE OF A PLEASURE WHICH
WOULD HAVE BEEN SO VERY DELIGHTFUL TO THEM. SO OFTEN AS SHE HAD HEARD
THEM WISH FOR A BALL AT HOME AS THE GREATEST OF ALL FELICITIES! AND
TO HAVE THEM AWAY WHEN IT WAS GIVEN--AND FOR HER TO BE OPENING THE
BALL--AND WITH MR. CRAWFORD TOO! SHE HOPED THEY WOULD NOT ENVY HER THAT
DISTINCTION NOW; BUT WHEN SHE LOOKED BACK TO THE STATE OF THINGS IN
THE AUTUMN, TO WHAT THEY HAD ALL BEEN TO EACH OTHER WHEN ONCE DANCING
IN THAT HOUSE BEFORE, THE PRESENT ARRANGEMENT WAS ALMOST MORE THAN SHE
COULD UNDERSTAND HERSELF.

THE BALL BEGAN. IT WAS RATHER HONOUR THAN HAPPINESS TO FANNY, FOR THE
FIRST DANCE AT LEAST: HER PARTNER WAS IN EXCELLENT SPIRITS, AND TRIED TO
IMPART THEM TO HER; BUT SHE WAS A GREAT DEAL TOO MUCH FRIGHTENED TO HAVE
ANY ENJOYMENT TILL SHE COULD SUPPOSE HERSELF NO LONGER LOOKED AT. YOUNG,
PRETTY, AND GENTLE, HOWEVER, SHE HAD NO AWKWARDNESSES THAT WERE NOT
AS GOOD AS GRACES, AND THERE WERE FEW PERSONS PRESENT THAT WERE NOT
DISPOSED TO PRAISE HER. SHE WAS ATTRACTIVE, SHE WAS MODEST, SHE WAS SIR
THOMAS'S NIECE, AND SHE WAS SOON SAID TO BE ADMIRED BY MR. CRAWFORD. IT
WAS ENOUGH TO GIVE HER GENERAL FAVOUR. SIR THOMAS HIMSELF WAS WATCHING
HER PROGRESS DOWN THE DANCE WITH MUCH COMPLACENCY; HE WAS PROUD OF HIS
NIECE; AND WITHOUT ATTRIBUTING ALL HER PERSONAL BEAUTY, AS MRS. NORRIS
SEEMED TO DO, TO HER TRANSPLANTATION TO MANSFIELD, HE WAS PLEASED WITH
HIMSELF FOR HAVING SUPPLIED EVERYTHING ELSE: EDUCATION AND MANNERS SHE
OWED TO HIM.

MISS CRAWFORD SAW MUCH OF SIR THOMAS'S THOUGHTS AS HE STOOD, AND HAVING,
IN SPITE OF ALL HIS WRONGS TOWARDS HER, A GENERAL PREVAILING DESIRE OF
RECOMMENDING HERSELF TO HIM, TOOK AN OPPORTUNITY OF STEPPING ASIDE TO
SAY SOMETHING AGREEABLE OF FANNY. HER PRAISE WAS WARM, AND HE
RECEIVED IT AS SHE COULD WISH, JOINING IN IT AS FAR AS DISCRETION, AND
POLITENESS, AND SLOWNESS OF SPEECH WOULD ALLOW, AND CERTAINLY APPEARING
TO GREATER ADVANTAGE ON THE SUBJECT THAN HIS LADY DID SOON AFTERWARDS,
WHEN MARY, PERCEIVING HER ON A SOFA VERY NEAR, TURNED ROUND BEFORE SHE
BEGAN TO DANCE, TO COMPLIMENT HER ON MISS PRICE'S LOOKS.

"YES, SHE DOES LOOK VERY WELL," WAS LADY BERTRAM'S PLACID REPLY.
"CHAPMAN HELPED HER TO DRESS. I SENT CHAPMAN TO HER." NOT BUT THAT
SHE WAS REALLY PLEASED TO HAVE FANNY ADMIRED; BUT SHE WAS SO MUCH MORE
STRUCK WITH HER OWN KINDNESS IN SENDING CHAPMAN TO HER, THAT SHE COULD
NOT GET IT OUT OF HER HEAD.

MISS CRAWFORD KNEW MRS. NORRIS TOO WELL TO THINK OF GRATIFYING HER
BY COMMENDATION OF FANNY; TO HER, IT WAS AS THE OCCASION OFFERED--"AH!
MA'AM, HOW MUCH WE WANT DEAR MRS. RUSHWORTH AND JULIA TO-NIGHT!" AND
MRS. NORRIS PAID HER WITH AS MANY SMILES AND COURTEOUS WORDS AS SHE HAD
TIME FOR, AMID SO MUCH OCCUPATION AS SHE FOUND FOR HERSELF IN MAKING
UP CARD-TABLES, GIVING HINTS TO SIR THOMAS, AND TRYING TO MOVE ALL THE
CHAPERONS TO A BETTER PART OF THE ROOM.

MISS CRAWFORD BLUNDERED MOST TOWARDS FANNY HERSELF IN HER INTENTIONS
TO PLEASE. SHE MEANT TO BE GIVING HER LITTLE HEART A HAPPY FLUTTER,
AND FILLING HER WITH SENSATIONS OF DELIGHTFUL SELF-CONSEQUENCE; AND,
MISINTERPRETING FANNY'S BLUSHES, STILL THOUGHT SHE MUST BE DOING SO WHEN
SHE WENT TO HER AFTER THE TWO FIRST DANCES, AND SAID, WITH A SIGNIFICANT
LOOK, "PERHAPS YOU CAN TELL ME WHY MY BROTHER GOES TO TOWN TO-MORROW?
HE SAYS HE HAS BUSINESS THERE, BUT WILL NOT TELL ME WHAT. THE FIRST TIME
HE EVER DENIED ME HIS CONFIDENCE! BUT THIS IS WHAT WE ALL COME TO.
ALL ARE SUPPLANTED SOONER OR LATER. NOW, I MUST APPLY TO YOU FOR
INFORMATION. PRAY, WHAT IS HENRY GOING FOR?"

FANNY PROTESTED HER IGNORANCE AS STEADILY AS HER EMBARRASSMENT ALLOWED.

"WELL, THEN," REPLIED MISS CRAWFORD, LAUGHING, "I MUST SUPPOSE IT TO BE
PURELY FOR THE PLEASURE OF CONVEYING YOUR BROTHER, AND OF TALKING OF YOU
BY THE WAY."

FANNY WAS CONFUSED, BUT IT WAS THE CONFUSION OF DISCONTENT; WHILE MISS
CRAWFORD WONDERED SHE DID NOT SMILE, AND THOUGHT HER OVER-ANXIOUS,
OR THOUGHT HER ODD, OR THOUGHT HER ANYTHING RATHER THAN INSENSIBLE OF
PLEASURE IN HENRY'S ATTENTIONS. FANNY HAD A GOOD DEAL OF ENJOYMENT IN
THE COURSE OF THE EVENING; BUT HENRY'S ATTENTIONS HAD VERY LITTLE TO
DO WITH IT. SHE WOULD MUCH RATHER NOT HAVE BEEN ASKED BY HIM AGAIN SO
VERY SOON, AND SHE WISHED SHE HAD NOT BEEN OBLIGED TO SUSPECT THAT HIS
PREVIOUS INQUIRIES OF MRS. NORRIS, ABOUT THE SUPPER HOUR, WERE ALL FOR
THE SAKE OF SECURING HER AT THAT PART OF THE EVENING. BUT IT WAS NOT TO
BE AVOIDED: HE MADE HER FEEL THAT SHE WAS THE OBJECT OF ALL; THOUGH SHE
COULD NOT SAY THAT IT WAS UNPLEASANTLY DONE, THAT THERE WAS INDELICACY
OR OSTENTATION IN HIS MANNER; AND SOMETIMES, WHEN HE TALKED OF WILLIAM,
HE WAS REALLY NOT UNAGREEABLE, AND SHEWED EVEN A WARMTH OF HEART
WHICH DID HIM CREDIT. BUT STILL HIS ATTENTIONS MADE NO PART OF HER
SATISFACTION. SHE WAS HAPPY WHENEVER SHE LOOKED AT WILLIAM, AND SAW HOW
PERFECTLY HE WAS ENJOYING HIMSELF, IN EVERY FIVE MINUTES THAT SHE COULD
WALK ABOUT WITH HIM AND HEAR HIS ACCOUNT OF HIS PARTNERS; SHE WAS HAPPY
IN KNOWING HERSELF ADMIRED; AND SHE WAS HAPPY IN HAVING THE TWO DANCES
WITH EDMUND STILL TO LOOK FORWARD TO, DURING THE GREATEST PART OF THE
EVENING, HER HAND BEING SO EAGERLY SOUGHT AFTER THAT HER INDEFINITE
ENGAGEMENT WITH HIM WAS IN CONTINUAL PERSPECTIVE. SHE WAS HAPPY EVEN
WHEN THEY DID TAKE PLACE; BUT NOT FROM ANY FLOW OF SPIRITS ON HIS SIDE,
OR ANY SUCH EXPRESSIONS OF TENDER GALLANTRY AS HAD BLESSED THE MORNING.
HIS MIND WAS FAGGED, AND HER HAPPINESS SPRUNG FROM BEING THE FRIEND WITH
WHOM IT COULD FIND REPOSE. "I AM WORN OUT WITH CIVILITY," SAID HE. "I
HAVE BEEN TALKING INCESSANTLY ALL NIGHT, AND WITH NOTHING TO SAY. BUT
WITH YOU, FANNY, THERE MAY BE PEACE. YOU WILL NOT WANT TO BE TALKED
TO. LET US HAVE THE LUXURY OF SILENCE." FANNY WOULD HARDLY EVEN SPEAK
HER AGREEMENT. A WEARINESS, ARISING PROBABLY, IN GREAT MEASURE, FROM THE
SAME FEELINGS WHICH HE HAD ACKNOWLEDGED IN THE MORNING, WAS PECULIARLY
TO BE RESPECTED, AND THEY WENT DOWN THEIR TWO DANCES TOGETHER WITH SUCH
SOBER TRANQUILLITY AS MIGHT SATISFY ANY LOOKER-ON THAT SIR THOMAS HAD
BEEN BRINGING UP NO WIFE FOR HIS YOUNGER SON.

THE EVENING HAD AFFORDED EDMUND LITTLE PLEASURE. MISS CRAWFORD HAD
BEEN IN GAY SPIRITS WHEN THEY FIRST DANCED TOGETHER, BUT IT WAS NOT HER
GAIETY THAT COULD DO HIM GOOD: IT RATHER SANK THAN RAISED HIS COMFORT;
AND AFTERWARDS, FOR HE FOUND HIMSELF STILL IMPELLED TO SEEK HER
AGAIN, SHE HAD ABSOLUTELY PAINED HIM BY HER MANNER OF SPEAKING OF THE
PROFESSION TO WHICH HE WAS NOW ON THE POINT OF BELONGING. THEY HAD
TALKED, AND THEY HAD BEEN SILENT; HE HAD REASONED, SHE HAD RIDICULED;
AND THEY HAD PARTED AT LAST WITH MUTUAL VEXATION. FANNY, NOT ABLE TO
REFRAIN ENTIRELY FROM OBSERVING THEM, HAD SEEN ENOUGH TO BE TOLERABLY
SATISFIED. IT WAS BARBAROUS TO BE HAPPY WHEN EDMUND WAS SUFFERING. YET
SOME HAPPINESS MUST AND WOULD ARISE FROM THE VERY CONVICTION THAT HE DID
SUFFER.

WHEN HER TWO DANCES WITH HIM WERE OVER, HER INCLINATION AND STRENGTH FOR
MORE WERE PRETTY WELL AT AN END; AND SIR THOMAS, HAVING SEEN HER WALK
RATHER THAN DANCE DOWN THE SHORTENING SET, BREATHLESS, AND WITH HER HAND
AT HER SIDE, GAVE HIS ORDERS FOR HER SITTING DOWN ENTIRELY. FROM THAT
TIME MR. CRAWFORD SAT DOWN LIKEWISE.

"POOR FANNY!" CRIED WILLIAM, COMING FOR A MOMENT TO VISIT HER, AND
WORKING AWAY HIS PARTNER'S FAN AS IF FOR LIFE, "HOW SOON SHE IS KNOCKED
UP! WHY, THE SPORT IS BUT JUST BEGUN. I HOPE WE SHALL KEEP IT UP THESE
TWO HOURS. HOW CAN YOU BE TIRED SO SOON?"

"SO SOON! MY GOOD FRIEND," SAID SIR THOMAS, PRODUCING HIS WATCH WITH ALL
NECESSARY CAUTION; "IT IS THREE O'CLOCK, AND YOUR SISTER IS NOT USED TO
THESE SORT OF HOURS."

"WELL, THEN, FANNY, YOU SHALL NOT GET UP TO-MORROW BEFORE I GO. SLEEP AS
LONG AS YOU CAN, AND NEVER MIND ME."

"OH! WILLIAM."

"WHAT! DID SHE THINK OF BEING UP BEFORE YOU SET OFF?"

"OH! YES, SIR," CRIED FANNY, RISING EAGERLY FROM HER SEAT TO BE NEARER
HER UNCLE; "I MUST GET UP AND BREAKFAST WITH HIM. IT WILL BE THE LAST
TIME, YOU KNOW; THE LAST MORNING."

"YOU HAD BETTER NOT. HE IS TO HAVE BREAKFASTED AND BE GONE BY HALF-PAST
NINE. MR. CRAWFORD, I THINK YOU CALL FOR HIM AT HALF-PAST NINE?"

FANNY WAS TOO URGENT, HOWEVER, AND HAD TOO MANY TEARS IN HER EYES FOR
DENIAL; AND IT ENDED IN A GRACIOUS "WELL, WELL!" WHICH WAS PERMISSION.

"YES, HALF-PAST NINE," SAID CRAWFORD TO WILLIAM AS THE LATTER WAS
LEAVING THEM, "AND I SHALL BE PUNCTUAL, FOR THERE WILL BE NO KIND SISTER
TO GET UP FOR ME." AND IN A LOWER TONE TO FANNY, "I SHALL HAVE ONLY
A DESOLATE HOUSE TO HURRY FROM. YOUR BROTHER WILL FIND MY IDEAS OF TIME
AND HIS OWN VERY DIFFERENT TO-MORROW."

AFTER A SHORT CONSIDERATION, SIR THOMAS ASKED CRAWFORD TO JOIN THE EARLY
BREAKFAST PARTY IN THAT HOUSE INSTEAD OF EATING ALONE: HE SHOULD HIMSELF
BE OF IT; AND THE READINESS WITH WHICH HIS INVITATION WAS ACCEPTED
CONVINCED HIM THAT THE SUSPICIONS WHENCE, HE MUST CONFESS TO HIMSELF,
THIS VERY BALL HAD IN GREAT MEASURE SPRUNG, WERE WELL FOUNDED. MR.
CRAWFORD WAS IN LOVE WITH FANNY. HE HAD A PLEASING ANTICIPATION OF WHAT
WOULD BE. HIS NIECE, MEANWHILE, DID NOT THANK HIM FOR WHAT HE HAD JUST
DONE. SHE HAD HOPED TO HAVE WILLIAM ALL TO HERSELF THE LAST MORNING. IT
WOULD HAVE BEEN AN UNSPEAKABLE INDULGENCE. BUT THOUGH HER WISHES
WERE OVERTHROWN, THERE WAS NO SPIRIT OF MURMURING WITHIN HER. ON THE
CONTRARY, SHE WAS SO TOTALLY UNUSED TO HAVE HER PLEASURE CONSULTED, OR
TO HAVE ANYTHING TAKE PLACE AT ALL IN THE WAY SHE COULD DESIRE, THAT SHE
WAS MORE DISPOSED TO WONDER AND REJOICE IN HAVING CARRIED HER POINT SO
FAR, THAN TO REPINE AT THE COUNTERACTION WHICH FOLLOWED.

SHORTLY AFTERWARD, SIR THOMAS WAS AGAIN INTERFERING A LITTLE WITH HER
INCLINATION, BY ADVISING HER TO GO IMMEDIATELY TO BED. "ADVISE" WAS HIS
WORD, BUT IT WAS THE ADVICE OF ABSOLUTE POWER, AND SHE HAD ONLY TO
RISE, AND, WITH MR. CRAWFORD'S VERY CORDIAL ADIEUS, PASS QUIETLY AWAY;
STOPPING AT THE ENTRANCE-DOOR, LIKE THE LADY OF BRANXHOLM HALL, "ONE
MOMENT AND NO MORE," TO VIEW THE HAPPY SCENE, AND TAKE A LAST LOOK AT
THE FIVE OR SIX DETERMINED COUPLE WHO WERE STILL HARD AT WORK; AND THEN,
CREEPING SLOWLY UP THE PRINCIPAL STAIRCASE, PURSUED BY THE CEASELESS
COUNTRY-DANCE, FEVERISH WITH HOPES AND FEARS, SOUP AND NEGUS,
SORE-FOOTED AND FATIGUED, RESTLESS AND AGITATED, YET FEELING, IN SPITE
OF EVERYTHING, THAT A BALL WAS INDEED DELIGHTFUL.

IN THUS SENDING HER AWAY, SIR THOMAS PERHAPS MIGHT NOT BE THINKING
MERELY OF HER HEALTH. IT MIGHT OCCUR TO HIM THAT MR. CRAWFORD HAD BEEN
SITTING BY HER LONG ENOUGH, OR HE MIGHT MEAN TO RECOMMEND HER AS A WIFE
BY SHEWING HER PERSUADABLENESS.



CHAPTER XXIX

THE BALL WAS OVER, AND THE BREAKFAST WAS SOON OVER TOO; THE LAST KISS
WAS GIVEN, AND WILLIAM WAS GONE. MR. CRAWFORD HAD, AS HE FORETOLD, BEEN
VERY PUNCTUAL, AND SHORT AND PLEASANT HAD BEEN THE MEAL.

AFTER SEEING WILLIAM TO THE LAST MOMENT, FANNY WALKED BACK TO THE
BREAKFAST-ROOM WITH A VERY SADDENED HEART TO GRIEVE OVER THE MELANCHOLY
CHANGE; AND THERE HER UNCLE KINDLY LEFT HER TO CRY IN PEACE, CONCEIVING,
PERHAPS, THAT THE DESERTED CHAIR OF EACH YOUNG MAN MIGHT EXERCISE HER
TENDER ENTHUSIASM, AND THAT THE REMAINING COLD PORK BONES AND MUSTARD IN
WILLIAM'S PLATE MIGHT BUT DIVIDE HER FEELINGS WITH THE BROKEN EGG-SHELLS
IN MR. CRAWFORD'S. SHE SAT AND CRIED CON AMORE AS HER UNCLE
INTENDED, BUT IT WAS CON AMORE FRATERNAL AND NO OTHER. WILLIAM WAS
GONE, AND SHE NOW FELT AS IF SHE HAD WASTED HALF HIS VISIT IN IDLE CARES
AND SELFISH SOLICITUDES UNCONNECTED WITH HIM.

FANNY'S DISPOSITION WAS SUCH THAT SHE COULD NEVER EVEN THINK OF HER
AUNT NORRIS IN THE MEAGRENESS AND CHEERLESSNESS OF HER OWN SMALL HOUSE,
WITHOUT REPROACHING HERSELF FOR SOME LITTLE WANT OF ATTENTION TO HER
WHEN THEY HAD BEEN LAST TOGETHER; MUCH LESS COULD HER FEELINGS ACQUIT
HER OF HAVING DONE AND SAID AND THOUGHT EVERYTHING BY WILLIAM THAT WAS
DUE TO HIM FOR A WHOLE FORTNIGHT.

IT WAS A HEAVY, MELANCHOLY DAY. SOON AFTER THE SECOND BREAKFAST, EDMUND
BADE THEM GOOD-BYE FOR A WEEK, AND MOUNTED HIS HORSE FOR PETERBOROUGH,
AND THEN ALL WERE GONE. NOTHING REMAINED OF LAST NIGHT BUT REMEMBRANCES,
WHICH SHE HAD NOBODY TO SHARE IN. SHE TALKED TO HER AUNT BERTRAM--SHE
MUST TALK TO SOMEBODY OF THE BALL; BUT HER AUNT HAD SEEN SO LITTLE OF
WHAT HAD PASSED, AND HAD SO LITTLE CURIOSITY, THAT IT WAS HEAVY WORK.
LADY BERTRAM WAS NOT CERTAIN OF ANYBODY'S DRESS OR ANYBODY'S PLACE AT
SUPPER BUT HER OWN. "SHE COULD NOT RECOLLECT WHAT IT WAS THAT SHE HAD
HEARD ABOUT ONE OF THE MISS MADDOXES, OR WHAT IT WAS THAT LADY PRESCOTT
HAD NOTICED IN FANNY: SHE WAS NOT SURE WHETHER COLONEL HARRISON HAD BEEN
TALKING OF MR. CRAWFORD OR OF WILLIAM WHEN HE SAID HE WAS THE FINEST
YOUNG MAN IN THE ROOM--SOMEBODY HAD WHISPERED SOMETHING TO HER; SHE HAD
FORGOT TO ASK SIR THOMAS WHAT IT COULD BE." AND THESE WERE HER LONGEST
SPEECHES AND CLEAREST COMMUNICATIONS: THE REST WAS ONLY A LANGUID "YES,
YES; VERY WELL; DID YOU? DID HE? I DID NOT SEE THAT; I SHOULD NOT KNOW
ONE FROM THE OTHER." THIS WAS VERY BAD. IT WAS ONLY BETTER THAN MRS.
NORRIS'S SHARP ANSWERS WOULD HAVE BEEN; BUT SHE BEING GONE HOME WITH
ALL THE SUPERNUMERARY JELLIES TO NURSE A SICK MAID, THERE WAS PEACE
AND GOOD-HUMOUR IN THEIR LITTLE PARTY, THOUGH IT COULD NOT BOAST MUCH
BESIDE.

THE EVENING WAS HEAVY LIKE THE DAY. "I CANNOT THINK WHAT IS THE MATTER
WITH ME," SAID LADY BERTRAM, WHEN THE TEA-THINGS WERE REMOVED. "I FEEL
QUITE STUPID. IT MUST BE SITTING UP SO LATE LAST NIGHT. FANNY, YOU MUST
DO SOMETHING TO KEEP ME AWAKE. I CANNOT WORK. FETCH THE CARDS; I FEEL SO
VERY STUPID."

THE CARDS WERE BROUGHT, AND FANNY PLAYED AT CRIBBAGE WITH HER AUNT TILL
BEDTIME; AND AS SIR THOMAS WAS READING TO HIMSELF, NO SOUNDS WERE
HEARD IN THE ROOM FOR THE NEXT TWO HOURS BEYOND THE RECKONINGS OF THE
GAME--"AND THAT MAKES THIRTY-ONE; FOUR IN HAND AND EIGHT IN CRIB. YOU
ARE TO DEAL, MA'AM; SHALL I DEAL FOR YOU?" FANNY THOUGHT AND THOUGHT
AGAIN OF THE DIFFERENCE WHICH TWENTY-FOUR HOURS HAD MADE IN THAT ROOM,
AND ALL THAT PART OF THE HOUSE. LAST NIGHT IT HAD BEEN HOPE AND SMILES,
BUSTLE AND MOTION, NOISE AND BRILLIANCY, IN THE DRAWING-ROOM, AND OUT
OF THE DRAWING-ROOM, AND EVERYWHERE. NOW IT WAS LANGUOR, AND ALL BUT
SOLITUDE.

A GOOD NIGHT'S REST IMPROVED HER SPIRITS. SHE COULD THINK OF WILLIAM THE
NEXT DAY MORE CHEERFULLY; AND AS THE MORNING AFFORDED HER AN OPPORTUNITY
OF TALKING OVER THURSDAY NIGHT WITH MRS. GRANT AND MISS CRAWFORD, IN A
VERY HANDSOME STYLE, WITH ALL THE HEIGHTENINGS OF IMAGINATION, AND
ALL THE LAUGHS OF PLAYFULNESS WHICH ARE SO ESSENTIAL TO THE SHADE OF A
DEPARTED BALL, SHE COULD AFTERWARDS BRING HER MIND WITHOUT MUCH EFFORT
INTO ITS EVERYDAY STATE, AND EASILY CONFORM TO THE TRANQUILLITY OF THE
PRESENT QUIET WEEK.

THEY WERE INDEED A SMALLER PARTY THAN SHE HAD EVER KNOWN THERE FOR
A WHOLE DAY TOGETHER, AND HE WAS GONE ON WHOM THE COMFORT AND
CHEERFULNESS OF EVERY FAMILY MEETING AND EVERY MEAL CHIEFLY DEPENDED.
BUT THIS MUST BE LEARNED TO BE ENDURED. HE WOULD SOON BE ALWAYS GONE;
AND SHE WAS THANKFUL THAT SHE COULD NOW SIT IN THE SAME ROOM WITH HER
UNCLE, HEAR HIS VOICE, RECEIVE HIS QUESTIONS, AND EVEN ANSWER THEM,
WITHOUT SUCH WRETCHED FEELINGS AS SHE HAD FORMERLY KNOWN.

"WE MISS OUR TWO YOUNG MEN," WAS SIR THOMAS'S OBSERVATION ON BOTH THE
FIRST AND SECOND DAY, AS THEY FORMED THEIR VERY REDUCED CIRCLE AFTER
DINNER; AND IN CONSIDERATION OF FANNY'S SWIMMING EYES, NOTHING MORE WAS
SAID ON THE FIRST DAY THAN TO DRINK THEIR GOOD HEALTH; BUT ON THE
SECOND IT LED TO SOMETHING FARTHER. WILLIAM WAS KINDLY COMMENDED AND
HIS PROMOTION HOPED FOR. "AND THERE IS NO REASON TO SUPPOSE," ADDED SIR
THOMAS, "BUT THAT HIS VISITS TO US MAY NOW BE TOLERABLY FREQUENT. AS TO
EDMUND, WE MUST LEARN TO DO WITHOUT HIM. THIS WILL BE THE LAST WINTER OF
HIS BELONGING TO US, AS HE HAS DONE."

"YES," SAID LADY BERTRAM, "BUT I WISH HE WAS NOT GOING AWAY. THEY ARE
ALL GOING AWAY, I THINK. I WISH THEY WOULD STAY AT HOME."

THIS WISH WAS LEVELLED PRINCIPALLY AT JULIA, WHO HAD JUST APPLIED FOR
PERMISSION TO GO TO TOWN WITH MARIA; AND AS SIR THOMAS THOUGHT IT BEST
FOR EACH DAUGHTER THAT THE PERMISSION SHOULD BE GRANTED, LADY BERTRAM,
THOUGH IN HER OWN GOOD-NATURE SHE WOULD NOT HAVE PREVENTED IT, WAS
LAMENTING THE CHANGE IT MADE IN THE PROSPECT OF JULIA'S RETURN, WHICH
WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE TAKEN PLACE ABOUT THIS TIME. A GREAT DEAL OF GOOD
SENSE FOLLOWED ON SIR THOMAS'S SIDE, TENDING TO RECONCILE HIS WIFE TO
THE ARRANGEMENT. EVERYTHING THAT A CONSIDERATE PARENT OUGHT TO FEEL
WAS ADVANCED FOR HER USE; AND EVERYTHING THAT AN AFFECTIONATE MOTHER
MUST FEEL IN PROMOTING HER CHILDREN'S ENJOYMENT WAS ATTRIBUTED TO HER
NATURE. LADY BERTRAM AGREED TO IT ALL WITH A CALM "YES"; AND AT THE END
OF A QUARTER OF AN HOUR'S SILENT CONSIDERATION SPONTANEOUSLY OBSERVED,
"SIR THOMAS, I HAVE BEEN THINKING--AND I AM VERY GLAD WE TOOK FANNY AS
WE DID, FOR NOW THE OTHERS ARE AWAY WE FEEL THE GOOD OF IT."

SIR THOMAS IMMEDIATELY IMPROVED THIS COMPLIMENT BY ADDING, "VERY TRUE.
WE SHEW FANNY WHAT A GOOD GIRL WE THINK HER BY PRAISING HER TO HER FACE,
SHE IS NOW A VERY VALUABLE COMPANION. IF WE HAVE BEEN KIND TO HER, SHE
IS NOW QUITE AS NECESSARY TO US."

"YES," SAID LADY BERTRAM PRESENTLY; "AND IT IS A COMFORT TO THINK THAT
WE SHALL ALWAYS HAVE HER."

SIR THOMAS PAUSED, HALF SMILED, GLANCED AT HIS NIECE, AND THEN GRAVELY
REPLIED, "SHE WILL NEVER LEAVE US, I HOPE, TILL INVITED TO SOME OTHER
HOME THAT MAY REASONABLY PROMISE HER GREATER HAPPINESS THAN SHE KNOWS
HERE."

"AND THAT IS NOT VERY LIKELY TO BE, SIR THOMAS. WHO SHOULD INVITE HER?
MARIA MIGHT BE VERY GLAD TO SEE HER AT SOTHERTON NOW AND THEN, BUT SHE
WOULD NOT THINK OF ASKING HER TO LIVE THERE; AND I AM SURE SHE IS BETTER
OFF HERE; AND BESIDES, I CANNOT DO WITHOUT HER."

THE WEEK WHICH PASSED SO QUIETLY AND PEACEABLY AT THE GREAT HOUSE IN
MANSFIELD HAD A VERY DIFFERENT CHARACTER AT THE PARSONAGE. TO THE YOUNG
LADY, AT LEAST, IN EACH FAMILY, IT BROUGHT VERY DIFFERENT FEELINGS. WHAT
WAS TRANQUILLITY AND COMFORT TO FANNY WAS TEDIOUSNESS AND VEXATION TO
MARY. SOMETHING AROSE FROM DIFFERENCE OF DISPOSITION AND HABIT: ONE SO
EASILY SATISFIED, THE OTHER SO UNUSED TO ENDURE; BUT STILL MORE MIGHT BE
IMPUTED TO DIFFERENCE OF CIRCUMSTANCES. IN SOME POINTS OF INTEREST THEY
WERE EXACTLY OPPOSED TO EACH OTHER. TO FANNY'S MIND, EDMUND'S ABSENCE
WAS REALLY, IN ITS CAUSE AND ITS TENDENCY, A RELIEF. TO MARY IT WAS
EVERY WAY PAINFUL. SHE FELT THE WANT OF HIS SOCIETY EVERY DAY, ALMOST
EVERY HOUR, AND WAS TOO MUCH IN WANT OF IT TO DERIVE ANYTHING BUT
IRRITATION FROM CONSIDERING THE OBJECT FOR WHICH HE WENT. HE COULD NOT
HAVE DEVISED ANYTHING MORE LIKELY TO RAISE HIS CONSEQUENCE THAN THIS
WEEK'S ABSENCE, OCCURRING AS IT DID AT THE VERY TIME OF HER BROTHER'S
GOING AWAY, OF WILLIAM PRICE'S GOING TOO, AND COMPLETING THE SORT OF
GENERAL BREAK-UP OF A PARTY WHICH HAD BEEN SO ANIMATED. SHE FELT IT
KEENLY. THEY WERE NOW A MISERABLE TRIO, CONFINED WITHIN DOORS BY A
SERIES OF RAIN AND SNOW, WITH NOTHING TO DO AND NO VARIETY TO HOPE FOR.
ANGRY AS SHE WAS WITH EDMUND FOR ADHERING TO HIS OWN NOTIONS, AND ACTING
ON THEM IN DEFIANCE OF HER (AND SHE HAD BEEN SO ANGRY THAT THEY HAD
HARDLY PARTED FRIENDS AT THE BALL), SHE COULD NOT HELP THINKING OF
HIM CONTINUALLY WHEN ABSENT, DWELLING ON HIS MERIT AND AFFECTION, AND
LONGING AGAIN FOR THE ALMOST DAILY MEETINGS THEY LATELY HAD. HIS ABSENCE
WAS UNNECESSARILY LONG. HE SHOULD NOT HAVE PLANNED SUCH AN ABSENCE--HE
SHOULD NOT HAVE LEFT HOME FOR A WEEK, WHEN HER OWN DEPARTURE FROM
MANSFIELD WAS SO NEAR. THEN SHE BEGAN TO BLAME HERSELF. SHE WISHED SHE
HAD NOT SPOKEN SO WARMLY IN THEIR LAST CONVERSATION. SHE WAS AFRAID SHE
HAD USED SOME STRONG, SOME CONTEMPTUOUS EXPRESSIONS IN SPEAKING OF THE
CLERGY, AND THAT SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN. IT WAS ILL-BRED; IT WAS WRONG.
SHE WISHED SUCH WORDS UNSAID WITH ALL HER HEART.

HER VEXATION DID NOT END WITH THE WEEK. ALL THIS WAS BAD, BUT SHE HAD
STILL MORE TO FEEL WHEN FRIDAY CAME ROUND AGAIN AND BROUGHT NO EDMUND;
WHEN SATURDAY CAME AND STILL NO EDMUND; AND WHEN, THROUGH THE SLIGHT
COMMUNICATION WITH THE OTHER FAMILY WHICH SUNDAY PRODUCED, SHE LEARNED
THAT HE HAD ACTUALLY WRITTEN HOME TO DEFER HIS RETURN, HAVING PROMISED
TO REMAIN SOME DAYS LONGER WITH HIS FRIEND.

IF SHE HAD FELT IMPATIENCE AND REGRET BEFORE--IF SHE HAD BEEN SORRY FOR
WHAT SHE SAID, AND FEARED ITS TOO STRONG EFFECT ON HIM--SHE NOW FELT
AND FEARED IT ALL TENFOLD MORE. SHE HAD, MOREOVER, TO CONTEND WITH ONE
DISAGREEABLE EMOTION ENTIRELY NEW TO HER--JEALOUSY. HIS FRIEND MR.
OWEN HAD SISTERS; HE MIGHT FIND THEM ATTRACTIVE. BUT, AT ANY RATE, HIS
STAYING AWAY AT A TIME WHEN, ACCORDING TO ALL PRECEDING PLANS, SHE WAS
TO REMOVE TO LONDON, MEANT SOMETHING THAT SHE COULD NOT BEAR. HAD HENRY
RETURNED, AS HE TALKED OF DOING, AT THE END OF THREE OR FOUR DAYS, SHE
SHOULD NOW HAVE BEEN LEAVING MANSFIELD. IT BECAME ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY
FOR HER TO GET TO FANNY AND TRY TO LEARN SOMETHING MORE. SHE COULD NOT
LIVE ANY LONGER IN SUCH SOLITARY WRETCHEDNESS; AND SHE MADE HER WAY
TO THE PARK, THROUGH DIFFICULTIES OF WALKING WHICH SHE HAD DEEMED
UNCONQUERABLE A WEEK BEFORE, FOR THE CHANCE OF HEARING A LITTLE IN
ADDITION, FOR THE SAKE OF AT LEAST HEARING HIS NAME.

THE FIRST HALF-HOUR WAS LOST, FOR FANNY AND LADY BERTRAM WERE TOGETHER,
AND UNLESS SHE HAD FANNY TO HERSELF SHE COULD HOPE FOR NOTHING. BUT
AT LAST LADY BERTRAM LEFT THE ROOM, AND THEN ALMOST IMMEDIATELY MISS
CRAWFORD THUS BEGAN, WITH A VOICE AS WELL REGULATED AS SHE COULD--"AND
HOW DO YOU LIKE YOUR COUSIN EDMUND'S STAYING AWAY SO LONG? BEING THE
ONLY YOUNG PERSON AT HOME, I CONSIDER YOU AS THE GREATEST SUFFERER.
YOU MUST MISS HIM. DOES HIS STAYING LONGER SURPRISE YOU?"

"I DO NOT KNOW," SAID FANNY HESITATINGLY. "YES; I HAD NOT PARTICULARLY
EXPECTED IT."

"PERHAPS HE WILL ALWAYS STAY LONGER THAN HE TALKS OF. IT IS THE GENERAL
WAY ALL YOUNG MEN DO."

"HE DID NOT, THE ONLY TIME HE WENT TO SEE MR. OWEN BEFORE."

"HE FINDS THE HOUSE MORE AGREEABLE NOW. HE IS A VERY--A VERY PLEASING
YOUNG MAN HIMSELF, AND I CANNOT HELP BEING RATHER CONCERNED AT NOT
SEEING HIM AGAIN BEFORE I GO TO LONDON, AS WILL NOW UNDOUBTEDLY BE THE
CASE. I AM LOOKING FOR HENRY EVERY DAY, AND AS SOON AS HE COMES THERE
WILL BE NOTHING TO DETAIN ME AT MANSFIELD. I SHOULD LIKE TO HAVE SEEN
HIM ONCE MORE, I CONFESS. BUT YOU MUST GIVE MY COMPLIMENTS TO HIM. YES;
I THINK IT MUST BE COMPLIMENTS. IS NOT THERE A SOMETHING WANTED,
MISS PRICE, IN OUR LANGUAGE--A SOMETHING BETWEEN COMPLIMENTS AND--AND
LOVE--TO SUIT THE SORT OF FRIENDLY ACQUAINTANCE WE HAVE HAD TOGETHER? SO
MANY MONTHS' ACQUAINTANCE! BUT COMPLIMENTS MAY BE SUFFICIENT HERE.
WAS HIS LETTER A LONG ONE? DOES HE GIVE YOU MUCH ACCOUNT OF WHAT HE IS
DOING? IS IT CHRISTMAS GAIETIES THAT HE IS STAYING FOR?"

"I ONLY HEARD A PART OF THE LETTER; IT WAS TO MY UNCLE; BUT I BELIEVE
IT WAS VERY SHORT; INDEED I AM SURE IT WAS BUT A FEW LINES. ALL THAT I
HEARD WAS THAT HIS FRIEND HAD PRESSED HIM TO STAY LONGER, AND THAT HE
HAD AGREED TO DO SO. A FEW DAYS LONGER, OR SOME DAYS LONGER; I AM
NOT QUITE SURE WHICH."

"OH! IF HE WROTE TO HIS FATHER; BUT I THOUGHT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN TO LADY
BERTRAM OR YOU. BUT IF HE WROTE TO HIS FATHER, NO WONDER HE WAS CONCISE.
WHO COULD WRITE CHAT TO SIR THOMAS? IF HE HAD WRITTEN TO YOU, THERE
WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE PARTICULARS. YOU WOULD HAVE HEARD OF BALLS
AND PARTIES. HE WOULD HAVE SENT YOU A DESCRIPTION OF EVERYTHING AND
EVERYBODY. HOW MANY MISS OWENS ARE THERE?"

"THREE GROWN UP."

"ARE THEY MUSICAL?"

"I DO NOT AT ALL KNOW. I NEVER HEARD."

"THAT IS THE FIRST QUESTION, YOU KNOW," SAID MISS CRAWFORD, TRYING TO
APPEAR GAY AND UNCONCERNED, "WHICH EVERY WOMAN WHO PLAYS HERSELF IS SURE
TO ASK ABOUT ANOTHER. BUT IT IS VERY FOOLISH TO ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT
ANY YOUNG LADIES--ABOUT ANY THREE SISTERS JUST GROWN UP; FOR ONE KNOWS,
WITHOUT BEING TOLD, EXACTLY WHAT THEY ARE: ALL VERY ACCOMPLISHED AND
PLEASING, AND ONE VERY PRETTY. THERE IS A BEAUTY IN EVERY FAMILY; IT IS
A REGULAR THING. TWO PLAY ON THE PIANOFORTE, AND ONE ON THE HARP; AND
ALL SING, OR WOULD SING IF THEY WERE TAUGHT, OR SING ALL THE BETTER FOR
NOT BEING TAUGHT; OR SOMETHING LIKE IT."

"I KNOW NOTHING OF THE MISS OWENS," SAID FANNY CALMLY.

"YOU KNOW NOTHING AND YOU CARE LESS, AS PEOPLE SAY. NEVER DID TONE
EXPRESS INDIFFERENCE PLAINER. INDEED, HOW CAN ONE CARE FOR THOSE ONE HAS
NEVER SEEN? WELL, WHEN YOUR COUSIN COMES BACK, HE WILL FIND MANSFIELD
VERY QUIET; ALL THE NOISY ONES GONE, YOUR BROTHER AND MINE AND MYSELF. I
DO NOT LIKE THE IDEA OF LEAVING MRS. GRANT NOW THE TIME DRAWS NEAR. SHE
DOES NOT LIKE MY GOING."

FANNY FELT OBLIGED TO SPEAK. "YOU CANNOT DOUBT YOUR BEING MISSED BY
MANY," SAID SHE. "YOU WILL BE VERY MUCH MISSED."

MISS CRAWFORD TURNED HER EYE ON HER, AS IF WANTING TO HEAR OR SEE MORE,
AND THEN LAUGHINGLY SAID, "OH YES! MISSED AS EVERY NOISY EVIL IS MISSED
WHEN IT IS TAKEN AWAY; THAT IS, THERE IS A GREAT DIFFERENCE FELT. BUT I
AM NOT FISHING; DON'T COMPLIMENT ME. IF I AM MISSED, IT WILL APPEAR.
I MAY BE DISCOVERED BY THOSE WHO WANT TO SEE ME. I SHALL NOT BE IN ANY
DOUBTFUL, OR DISTANT, OR UNAPPROACHABLE REGION."

NOW FANNY COULD NOT BRING HERSELF TO SPEAK, AND MISS CRAWFORD WAS
DISAPPOINTED; FOR SHE HAD HOPED TO HEAR SOME PLEASANT ASSURANCE OF HER
POWER FROM ONE WHO SHE THOUGHT MUST KNOW, AND HER SPIRITS WERE CLOUDED
AGAIN.

"THE MISS OWENS," SAID SHE, SOON AFTERWARDS; "SUPPOSE YOU WERE TO HAVE
ONE OF THE MISS OWENS SETTLED AT THORNTON LACEY; HOW SHOULD YOU LIKE IT?
STRANGER THINGS HAVE HAPPENED. I DARE SAY THEY ARE TRYING FOR IT. AND
THEY ARE QUITE IN THE LIGHT, FOR IT WOULD BE A VERY PRETTY ESTABLISHMENT
FOR THEM. I DO NOT AT ALL WONDER OR BLAME THEM. IT IS EVERYBODY'S DUTY
TO DO AS WELL FOR THEMSELVES AS THEY CAN. SIR THOMAS BERTRAM'S SON IS
SOMEBODY; AND NOW HE IS IN THEIR OWN LINE. THEIR FATHER IS A CLERGYMAN,
AND THEIR BROTHER IS A CLERGYMAN, AND THEY ARE ALL CLERGYMEN TOGETHER.
HE IS THEIR LAWFUL PROPERTY; HE FAIRLY BELONGS TO THEM. YOU DON'T SPEAK,
FANNY; MISS PRICE, YOU DON'T SPEAK. BUT HONESTLY NOW, DO NOT YOU RATHER
EXPECT IT THAN OTHERWISE?"

"NO," SAID FANNY STOUTLY, "I DO NOT EXPECT IT AT ALL."

"NOT AT ALL!" CRIED MISS CRAWFORD WITH ALACRITY. "I WONDER AT THAT. BUT
I DARE SAY YOU KNOW EXACTLY--I ALWAYS IMAGINE YOU ARE--PERHAPS YOU DO
NOT THINK HIM LIKELY TO MARRY AT ALL--OR NOT AT PRESENT."

"NO, I DO NOT," SAID FANNY SOFTLY, HOPING SHE DID NOT ERR EITHER IN THE
BELIEF OR THE ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF IT.

HER COMPANION LOOKED AT HER KEENLY; AND GATHERING GREATER SPIRIT FROM
THE BLUSH SOON PRODUCED FROM SUCH A LOOK, ONLY SAID, "HE IS BEST OFF AS
HE IS," AND TURNED THE SUBJECT.



CHAPTER XXX

MISS CRAWFORD'S UNEASINESS WAS MUCH LIGHTENED BY THIS CONVERSATION, AND
SHE WALKED HOME AGAIN IN SPIRITS WHICH MIGHT HAVE DEFIED ALMOST ANOTHER
WEEK OF THE SAME SMALL PARTY IN THE SAME BAD WEATHER, HAD THEY BEEN PUT
TO THE PROOF; BUT AS THAT VERY EVENING BROUGHT HER BROTHER DOWN FROM
LONDON AGAIN IN QUITE, OR MORE THAN QUITE, HIS USUAL CHEERFULNESS, SHE
HAD NOTHING FARTHER TO TRY HER OWN. HIS STILL REFUSING TO TELL HER WHAT
HE HAD GONE FOR WAS BUT THE PROMOTION OF GAIETY; A DAY BEFORE IT MIGHT
HAVE IRRITATED, BUT NOW IT WAS A PLEASANT JOKE--SUSPECTED ONLY OF
CONCEALING SOMETHING PLANNED AS A PLEASANT SURPRISE TO HERSELF. AND THE
NEXT DAY DID BRING A SURPRISE TO HER. HENRY HAD SAID HE SHOULD JUST
GO AND ASK THE BERTRAMS HOW THEY DID, AND BE BACK IN TEN MINUTES, BUT
HE WAS GONE ABOVE AN HOUR; AND WHEN HIS SISTER, WHO HAD BEEN WAITING FOR
HIM TO WALK WITH HER IN THE GARDEN, MET HIM AT LAST MOST IMPATIENTLY IN
THE SWEEP, AND CRIED OUT, "MY DEAR HENRY, WHERE CAN YOU HAVE BEEN
ALL THIS TIME?" HE HAD ONLY TO SAY THAT HE HAD BEEN SITTING WITH LADY
BERTRAM AND FANNY.

"SITTING WITH THEM AN HOUR AND A HALF!" EXCLAIMED MARY.

BUT THIS WAS ONLY THE BEGINNING OF HER SURPRISE.

"YES, MARY," SAID HE, DRAWING HER ARM WITHIN HIS, AND WALKING ALONG
THE SWEEP AS IF NOT KNOWING WHERE HE WAS: "I COULD NOT GET AWAY SOONER;
FANNY LOOKED SO LOVELY! I AM QUITE DETERMINED, MARY. MY MIND IS ENTIRELY
MADE UP. WILL IT ASTONISH YOU? NO: YOU MUST BE AWARE THAT I AM QUITE
DETERMINED TO MARRY FANNY PRICE."

THE SURPRISE WAS NOW COMPLETE; FOR, IN SPITE OF WHATEVER HIS
CONSCIOUSNESS MIGHT SUGGEST, A SUSPICION OF HIS HAVING ANY SUCH VIEWS
HAD NEVER ENTERED HIS SISTER'S IMAGINATION; AND SHE LOOKED SO TRULY THE
ASTONISHMENT SHE FELT, THAT HE WAS OBLIGED TO REPEAT WHAT HE HAD SAID,
AND MORE FULLY AND MORE SOLEMNLY. THE CONVICTION OF HIS DETERMINATION
ONCE ADMITTED, IT WAS NOT UNWELCOME. THERE WAS EVEN PLEASURE WITH THE
SURPRISE. MARY WAS IN A STATE OF MIND TO REJOICE IN A CONNEXION WITH THE
BERTRAM FAMILY, AND TO BE NOT DISPLEASED WITH HER BROTHER'S MARRYING A
LITTLE BENEATH HIM.

"YES, MARY," WAS HENRY'S CONCLUDING ASSURANCE. "I AM FAIRLY CAUGHT.
YOU KNOW WITH WHAT IDLE DESIGNS I BEGAN; BUT THIS IS THE END OF THEM.
I HAVE, I FLATTER MYSELF, MADE NO INCONSIDERABLE PROGRESS IN HER
AFFECTIONS; BUT MY OWN ARE ENTIRELY FIXED."

"LUCKY, LUCKY GIRL!" CRIED MARY, AS SOON AS SHE COULD SPEAK; "WHAT A
MATCH FOR HER! MY DEAREST HENRY, THIS MUST BE MY FIRST FEELING; BUT
MY SECOND, WHICH YOU SHALL HAVE AS SINCERELY, IS, THAT I APPROVE YOUR
CHOICE FROM MY SOUL, AND FORESEE YOUR HAPPINESS AS HEARTILY AS I WISH
AND DESIRE IT. YOU WILL HAVE A SWEET LITTLE WIFE; ALL GRATITUDE AND
DEVOTION. EXACTLY WHAT YOU DESERVE. WHAT AN AMAZING MATCH FOR HER! MRS.
NORRIS OFTEN TALKS OF HER LUCK; WHAT WILL SHE SAY NOW? THE DELIGHT
OF ALL THE FAMILY, INDEED! AND SHE HAS SOME TRUE FRIENDS IN IT! HOW
THEY WILL REJOICE! BUT TELL ME ALL ABOUT IT! TALK TO ME FOR EVER. WHEN
DID YOU BEGIN TO THINK SERIOUSLY ABOUT HER?"

NOTHING COULD BE MORE IMPOSSIBLE THAN TO ANSWER SUCH A QUESTION, THOUGH
NOTHING COULD BE MORE AGREEABLE THAN TO HAVE IT ASKED. "HOW THE PLEASING
PLAGUE HAD STOLEN ON HIM" HE COULD NOT SAY; AND BEFORE HE HAD EXPRESSED
THE SAME SENTIMENT WITH A LITTLE VARIATION OF WORDS THREE TIMES OVER,
HIS SISTER EAGERLY INTERRUPTED HIM WITH, "AH, MY DEAR HENRY, AND THIS
IS WHAT TOOK YOU TO LONDON! THIS WAS YOUR BUSINESS! YOU CHOSE TO CONSULT
THE ADMIRAL BEFORE YOU MADE UP YOUR MIND."

BUT THIS HE STOUTLY DENIED. HE KNEW HIS UNCLE TOO WELL TO CONSULT HIM ON
ANY MATRIMONIAL SCHEME. THE ADMIRAL HATED MARRIAGE, AND THOUGHT IT NEVER
PARDONABLE IN A YOUNG MAN OF INDEPENDENT FORTUNE.

"WHEN FANNY IS KNOWN TO HIM," CONTINUED HENRY, "HE WILL DOAT ON HER.
SHE IS EXACTLY THE WOMAN TO DO AWAY EVERY PREJUDICE OF SUCH A MAN AS
THE ADMIRAL, FOR SHE HE WOULD DESCRIBE, IF INDEED HE HAS NOW DELICACY
OF LANGUAGE ENOUGH TO EMBODY HIS OWN IDEAS. BUT TILL IT IS ABSOLUTELY
SETTLED--SETTLED BEYOND ALL INTERFERENCE, HE SHALL KNOW NOTHING OF THE
MATTER. NO, MARY, YOU ARE QUITE MISTAKEN. YOU HAVE NOT DISCOVERED MY
BUSINESS YET."

"WELL, WELL, I AM SATISFIED. I KNOW NOW TO WHOM IT MUST RELATE, AND AM
IN NO HURRY FOR THE REST. FANNY PRICE! WONDERFUL, QUITE WONDERFUL! THAT
MANSFIELD SHOULD HAVE DONE SO MUCH FOR--THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE FOUND
YOUR FATE IN MANSFIELD! BUT YOU ARE QUITE RIGHT; YOU COULD NOT HAVE
CHOSEN BETTER. THERE IS NOT A BETTER GIRL IN THE WORLD, AND YOU DO NOT
WANT FOR FORTUNE; AND AS TO HER CONNEXIONS, THEY ARE MORE THAN GOOD. THE
BERTRAMS ARE UNDOUBTEDLY SOME OF THE FIRST PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY. SHE
IS NIECE TO SIR THOMAS BERTRAM; THAT WILL BE ENOUGH FOR THE WORLD. BUT
GO ON, GO ON. TELL ME MORE. WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS? DOES SHE KNOW HER OWN
HAPPINESS?"

"NO."

"WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?"

"FOR--FOR VERY LITTLE MORE THAN OPPORTUNITY. MARY, SHE IS NOT LIKE HER
COUSINS; BUT I THINK I SHALL NOT ASK IN VAIN."

"OH NO! YOU CANNOT. WERE YOU EVEN LESS PLEASING--SUPPOSING HER NOT TO
LOVE YOU ALREADY (OF WHICH, HOWEVER, I CAN HAVE LITTLE DOUBT)--YOU WOULD
BE SAFE. THE GENTLENESS AND GRATITUDE OF HER DISPOSITION WOULD SECURE
HER ALL YOUR OWN IMMEDIATELY. FROM MY SOUL I DO NOT THINK SHE WOULD
MARRY YOU WITHOUT LOVE; THAT IS, IF THERE IS A GIRL IN THE WORLD
CAPABLE OF BEING UNINFLUENCED BY AMBITION, I CAN SUPPOSE IT HER; BUT ASK
HER TO LOVE YOU, AND SHE WILL NEVER HAVE THE HEART TO REFUSE."

AS SOON AS HER EAGERNESS COULD REST IN SILENCE, HE WAS AS HAPPY TO TELL
AS SHE COULD BE TO LISTEN; AND A CONVERSATION FOLLOWED ALMOST AS DEEPLY
INTERESTING TO HER AS TO HIMSELF, THOUGH HE HAD IN FACT NOTHING TO
RELATE BUT HIS OWN SENSATIONS, NOTHING TO DWELL ON BUT FANNY'S CHARMS.
FANNY'S BEAUTY OF FACE AND FIGURE, FANNY'S GRACES OF MANNER AND GOODNESS
OF HEART, WERE THE EXHAUSTLESS THEME. THE GENTLENESS, MODESTY, AND
SWEETNESS OF HER CHARACTER WERE WARMLY EXPATIATED ON; THAT SWEETNESS
WHICH MAKES SO ESSENTIAL A PART OF EVERY WOMAN'S WORTH IN THE JUDGMENT
OF MAN, THAT THOUGH HE SOMETIMES LOVES WHERE IT IS NOT, HE CAN NEVER
BELIEVE IT ABSENT. HER TEMPER HE HAD GOOD REASON TO DEPEND ON AND
TO PRAISE. HE HAD OFTEN SEEN IT TRIED. WAS THERE ONE OF THE FAMILY,
EXCEPTING EDMUND, WHO HAD NOT IN SOME WAY OR OTHER CONTINUALLY EXERCISED
HER PATIENCE AND FORBEARANCE? HER AFFECTIONS WERE EVIDENTLY STRONG. TO
SEE HER WITH HER BROTHER! WHAT COULD MORE DELIGHTFULLY PROVE THAT THE
WARMTH OF HER HEART WAS EQUAL TO ITS GENTLENESS? WHAT COULD BE MORE
ENCOURAGING TO A MAN WHO HAD HER LOVE IN VIEW? THEN, HER UNDERSTANDING
WAS BEYOND EVERY SUSPICION, QUICK AND CLEAR; AND HER MANNERS WERE THE
MIRROR OF HER OWN MODEST AND ELEGANT MIND. NOR WAS THIS ALL. HENRY
CRAWFORD HAD TOO MUCH SENSE NOT TO FEEL THE WORTH OF GOOD PRINCIPLES
IN A WIFE, THOUGH HE WAS TOO LITTLE ACCUSTOMED TO SERIOUS REFLECTION TO
KNOW THEM BY THEIR PROPER NAME; BUT WHEN HE TALKED OF HER HAVING SUCH A
STEADINESS AND REGULARITY OF CONDUCT, SUCH A HIGH NOTION OF HONOUR, AND
SUCH AN OBSERVANCE OF DECORUM AS MIGHT WARRANT ANY MAN IN THE FULLEST
DEPENDENCE ON HER FAITH AND INTEGRITY, HE EXPRESSED WHAT WAS INSPIRED BY
THE KNOWLEDGE OF HER BEING WELL PRINCIPLED AND RELIGIOUS.

"I COULD SO WHOLLY AND ABSOLUTELY CONFIDE IN HER," SAID HE; "AND THAT
IS WHAT I WANT."

WELL MIGHT HIS SISTER, BELIEVING AS SHE REALLY DID THAT HIS OPINION OF
FANNY PRICE WAS SCARCELY BEYOND HER MERITS, REJOICE IN HER PROSPECTS.

"THE MORE I THINK OF IT," SHE CRIED, "THE MORE AM I CONVINCED THAT YOU
ARE DOING QUITE RIGHT; AND THOUGH I SHOULD NEVER HAVE SELECTED FANNY
PRICE AS THE GIRL MOST LIKELY TO ATTACH YOU, I AM NOW PERSUADED SHE IS
THE VERY ONE TO MAKE YOU HAPPY. YOUR WICKED PROJECT UPON HER PEACE TURNS
OUT A CLEVER THOUGHT INDEED. YOU WILL BOTH FIND YOUR GOOD IN IT."

"IT WAS BAD, VERY BAD IN ME AGAINST SUCH A CREATURE; BUT I DID NOT KNOW
HER THEN; AND SHE SHALL HAVE NO REASON TO LAMENT THE HOUR THAT FIRST PUT
IT INTO MY HEAD. I WILL MAKE HER VERY HAPPY, MARY; HAPPIER THAN SHE HAS
EVER YET BEEN HERSELF, OR EVER SEEN ANYBODY ELSE. I WILL NOT TAKE HER
FROM NORTHAMPTONSHIRE. I SHALL LET EVERINGHAM, AND RENT A PLACE IN THIS
NEIGHBOURHOOD; PERHAPS STANWIX LODGE. I SHALL LET A SEVEN YEARS' LEASE
OF EVERINGHAM. I AM SURE OF AN EXCELLENT TENANT AT HALF A WORD. I COULD
NAME THREE PEOPLE NOW, WHO WOULD GIVE ME MY OWN TERMS AND THANK ME."

"HA!" CRIED MARY; "SETTLE IN NORTHAMPTONSHIRE! THAT IS PLEASANT! THEN WE
SHALL BE ALL TOGETHER."

WHEN SHE HAD SPOKEN IT, SHE RECOLLECTED HERSELF, AND WISHED IT UNSAID;
BUT THERE WAS NO NEED OF CONFUSION; FOR HER BROTHER SAW HER ONLY AS THE
SUPPOSED INMATE OF MANSFIELD PARSONAGE, AND REPLIED BUT TO INVITE HER IN
THE KINDEST MANNER TO HIS OWN HOUSE, AND TO CLAIM THE BEST RIGHT IN HER.

"YOU MUST GIVE US MORE THAN HALF YOUR TIME," SAID HE. "I CANNOT ADMIT
MRS. GRANT TO HAVE AN EQUAL CLAIM WITH FANNY AND MYSELF, FOR WE SHALL
BOTH HAVE A RIGHT IN YOU. FANNY WILL BE SO TRULY YOUR SISTER!"

MARY HAD ONLY TO BE GRATEFUL AND GIVE GENERAL ASSURANCES; BUT SHE WAS
NOW VERY FULLY PURPOSED TO BE THE GUEST OF NEITHER BROTHER NOR SISTER
MANY MONTHS LONGER.

"YOU WILL DIVIDE YOUR YEAR BETWEEN LONDON AND NORTHAMPTONSHIRE?"

"YES."

"THAT'S RIGHT; AND IN LONDON, OF COURSE, A HOUSE OF YOUR OWN: NO LONGER
WITH THE ADMIRAL. MY DEAREST HENRY, THE ADVANTAGE TO YOU OF GETTING AWAY
FROM THE ADMIRAL BEFORE YOUR MANNERS ARE HURT BY THE CONTAGION OF HIS,
BEFORE YOU HAVE CONTRACTED ANY OF HIS FOOLISH OPINIONS, OR LEARNED TO
SIT OVER YOUR DINNER AS IF IT WERE THE BEST BLESSING OF LIFE! YOU ARE
NOT SENSIBLE OF THE GAIN, FOR YOUR REGARD FOR HIM HAS BLINDED YOU; BUT,
IN MY ESTIMATION, YOUR MARRYING EARLY MAY BE THE SAVING OF YOU. TO HAVE
SEEN YOU GROW LIKE THE ADMIRAL IN WORD OR DEED, LOOK OR GESTURE, WOULD
HAVE BROKEN MY HEART."

"WELL, WELL, WE DO NOT THINK QUITE ALIKE HERE. THE ADMIRAL HAS HIS
FAULTS, BUT HE IS A VERY GOOD MAN, AND HAS BEEN MORE THAN A FATHER TO
ME. FEW FATHERS WOULD HAVE LET ME HAVE MY OWN WAY HALF SO MUCH. YOU MUST
NOT PREJUDICE FANNY AGAINST HIM. I MUST HAVE THEM LOVE ONE ANOTHER."

MARY REFRAINED FROM SAYING WHAT SHE FELT, THAT THERE COULD NOT BE TWO
PERSONS IN EXISTENCE WHOSE CHARACTERS AND MANNERS WERE LESS ACCORDANT:
TIME WOULD DISCOVER IT TO HIM; BUT SHE COULD NOT HELP THIS REFLECTION
ON THE ADMIRAL. "HENRY, I THINK SO HIGHLY OF FANNY PRICE, THAT IF I
COULD SUPPOSE THE NEXT MRS. CRAWFORD WOULD HAVE HALF THE REASON WHICH
MY POOR ILL-USED AUNT HAD TO ABHOR THE VERY NAME, I WOULD PREVENT THE
MARRIAGE, IF POSSIBLE; BUT I KNOW YOU: I KNOW THAT A WIFE YOU LOVED
WOULD BE THE HAPPIEST OF WOMEN, AND THAT EVEN WHEN YOU CEASED TO
LOVE, SHE WOULD YET FIND IN YOU THE LIBERALITY AND GOOD-BREEDING OF A
GENTLEMAN."

THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF NOT DOING EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD TO MAKE FANNY
PRICE HAPPY, OR OF CEASING TO LOVE FANNY PRICE, WAS OF COURSE THE
GROUNDWORK OF HIS ELOQUENT ANSWER.

"HAD YOU SEEN HER THIS MORNING, MARY," HE CONTINUED, "ATTENDING WITH
SUCH INEFFABLE SWEETNESS AND PATIENCE TO ALL THE DEMANDS OF HER AUNT'S
STUPIDITY, WORKING WITH HER, AND FOR HER, HER COLOUR BEAUTIFULLY
HEIGHTENED AS SHE LEANT OVER THE WORK, THEN RETURNING TO HER SEAT TO
FINISH A NOTE WHICH SHE WAS PREVIOUSLY ENGAGED IN WRITING FOR THAT
STUPID WOMAN'S SERVICE, AND ALL THIS WITH SUCH UNPRETENDING GENTLENESS,
SO MUCH AS IF IT WERE A MATTER OF COURSE THAT SHE WAS NOT TO HAVE A
MOMENT AT HER OWN COMMAND, HER HAIR ARRANGED AS NEATLY AS IT ALWAYS IS,
AND ONE LITTLE CURL FALLING FORWARD AS SHE WROTE, WHICH SHE NOW AND THEN
SHOOK BACK, AND IN THE MIDST OF ALL THIS, STILL SPEAKING AT INTERVALS TO
ME, OR LISTENING, AND AS IF SHE LIKED TO LISTEN, TO WHAT I SAID. HAD
YOU SEEN HER SO, MARY, YOU WOULD NOT HAVE IMPLIED THE POSSIBILITY OF HER
POWER OVER MY HEART EVER CEASING."

"MY DEAREST HENRY," CRIED MARY, STOPPING SHORT, AND SMILING IN HIS FACE,
"HOW GLAD I AM TO SEE YOU SO MUCH IN LOVE! IT QUITE DELIGHTS ME. BUT
WHAT WILL MRS. RUSHWORTH AND JULIA SAY?"

"I CARE NEITHER WHAT THEY SAY NOR WHAT THEY FEEL. THEY WILL NOW SEE WHAT
SORT OF WOMAN IT IS THAT CAN ATTACH ME, THAT CAN ATTACH A MAN OF SENSE.
I WISH THE DISCOVERY MAY DO THEM ANY GOOD. AND THEY WILL NOW SEE THEIR
COUSIN TREATED AS SHE OUGHT TO BE, AND I WISH THEY MAY BE HEARTILY
ASHAMED OF THEIR OWN ABOMINABLE NEGLECT AND UNKINDNESS. THEY WILL BE
ANGRY," HE ADDED, AFTER A MOMENT'S SILENCE, AND IN A COOLER TONE; "MRS.
RUSHWORTH WILL BE VERY ANGRY. IT WILL BE A BITTER PILL TO HER; THAT IS,
LIKE OTHER BITTER PILLS, IT WILL HAVE TWO MOMENTS' ILL FLAVOUR, AND THEN
BE SWALLOWED AND FORGOTTEN; FOR I AM NOT SUCH A COXCOMB AS TO SUPPOSE
HER FEELINGS MORE LASTING THAN OTHER WOMEN'S, THOUGH I WAS THE OBJECT
OF THEM. YES, MARY, MY FANNY WILL FEEL A DIFFERENCE INDEED: A DAILY,
HOURLY DIFFERENCE, IN THE BEHAVIOUR OF EVERY BEING WHO APPROACHES HER;
AND IT WILL BE THE COMPLETION OF MY HAPPINESS TO KNOW THAT I AM THE DOER
OF IT, THAT I AM THE PERSON TO GIVE THE CONSEQUENCE SO JUSTLY HER DUE.
NOW SHE IS DEPENDENT, HELPLESS, FRIENDLESS, NEGLECTED, FORGOTTEN."

"NAY, HENRY, NOT BY ALL; NOT FORGOTTEN BY ALL; NOT FRIENDLESS OR
FORGOTTEN. HER COUSIN EDMUND NEVER FORGETS HER."

"EDMUND! TRUE, I BELIEVE HE IS, GENERALLY SPEAKING, KIND TO HER, AND
SO IS SIR THOMAS IN HIS WAY; BUT IT IS THE WAY OF A RICH, SUPERIOR,
LONG-WORDED, ARBITRARY UNCLE. WHAT CAN SIR THOMAS AND EDMUND TOGETHER
DO, WHAT DO THEY DO FOR HER HAPPINESS, COMFORT, HONOUR, AND DIGNITY IN
THE WORLD, TO WHAT I SHALL DO?"



CHAPTER XXXI

HENRY CRAWFORD WAS AT MANSFIELD PARK AGAIN THE NEXT MORNING, AND AT AN
EARLIER HOUR THAN COMMON VISITING WARRANTS. THE TWO LADIES WERE TOGETHER
IN THE BREAKFAST-ROOM, AND, FORTUNATELY FOR HIM, LADY BERTRAM WAS ON THE
VERY POINT OF QUITTING IT AS HE ENTERED. SHE WAS ALMOST AT THE DOOR, AND
NOT CHUSING BY ANY MEANS TO TAKE SO MUCH TROUBLE IN VAIN, SHE STILL WENT
ON, AFTER A CIVIL RECEPTION, A SHORT SENTENCE ABOUT BEING WAITED FOR,
AND A "LET SIR THOMAS KNOW" TO THE SERVANT.

HENRY, OVERJOYED TO HAVE HER GO, BOWED AND WATCHED HER OFF, AND WITHOUT
LOSING ANOTHER MOMENT, TURNED INSTANTLY TO FANNY, AND, TAKING OUT SOME
LETTERS, SAID, WITH A MOST ANIMATED LOOK, "I MUST ACKNOWLEDGE MYSELF
INFINITELY OBLIGED TO ANY CREATURE WHO GIVES ME SUCH AN OPPORTUNITY
OF SEEING YOU ALONE: I HAVE BEEN WISHING IT MORE THAN YOU CAN HAVE ANY
IDEA. KNOWING AS I DO WHAT YOUR FEELINGS AS A SISTER ARE, I COULD HARDLY
HAVE BORNE THAT ANY ONE IN THE HOUSE SHOULD SHARE WITH YOU IN THE
FIRST KNOWLEDGE OF THE NEWS I NOW BRING. HE IS MADE. YOUR BROTHER IS A
LIEUTENANT. I HAVE THE INFINITE SATISFACTION OF CONGRATULATING YOU ON
YOUR BROTHER'S PROMOTION. HERE ARE THE LETTERS WHICH ANNOUNCE IT, THIS
MOMENT COME TO HAND. YOU WILL, PERHAPS, LIKE TO SEE THEM."

FANNY COULD NOT SPEAK, BUT HE DID NOT WANT HER TO SPEAK. TO SEE THE
EXPRESSION OF HER EYES, THE CHANGE OF HER COMPLEXION, THE PROGRESS OF
HER FEELINGS, THEIR DOUBT, CONFUSION, AND FELICITY, WAS ENOUGH. SHE TOOK
THE LETTERS AS HE GAVE THEM. THE FIRST WAS FROM THE ADMIRAL TO INFORM
HIS NEPHEW, IN A FEW WORDS, OF HIS HAVING SUCCEEDED IN THE OBJECT HE HAD
UNDERTAKEN, THE PROMOTION OF YOUNG PRICE, AND ENCLOSING TWO MORE, ONE
FROM THE SECRETARY OF THE FIRST LORD TO A FRIEND, WHOM THE ADMIRAL HAD
SET TO WORK IN THE BUSINESS, THE OTHER FROM THAT FRIEND TO HIMSELF,
BY WHICH IT APPEARED THAT HIS LORDSHIP HAD THE VERY GREAT HAPPINESS OF
ATTENDING TO THE RECOMMENDATION OF SIR CHARLES; THAT SIR CHARLES WAS
MUCH DELIGHTED IN HAVING SUCH AN OPPORTUNITY OF PROVING HIS REGARD
FOR ADMIRAL CRAWFORD, AND THAT THE CIRCUMSTANCE OF MR. WILLIAM PRICE'S
COMMISSION AS SECOND LIEUTENANT OF H.M. SLOOP THRUSH BEING MADE OUT WAS
SPREADING GENERAL JOY THROUGH A WIDE CIRCLE OF GREAT PEOPLE.

WHILE HER HAND WAS TREMBLING UNDER THESE LETTERS, HER EYE RUNNING FROM
ONE TO THE OTHER, AND HER HEART SWELLING WITH EMOTION, CRAWFORD THUS
CONTINUED, WITH UNFEIGNED EAGERNESS, TO EXPRESS HIS INTEREST IN THE
EVENT--

"I WILL NOT TALK OF MY OWN HAPPINESS," SAID HE, "GREAT AS IT IS, FOR I
THINK ONLY OF YOURS. COMPARED WITH YOU, WHO HAS A RIGHT TO BE HAPPY? I
HAVE ALMOST GRUDGED MYSELF MY OWN PRIOR KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT YOU OUGHT TO
HAVE KNOWN BEFORE ALL THE WORLD. I HAVE NOT LOST A MOMENT, HOWEVER.
THE POST WAS LATE THIS MORNING, BUT THERE HAS NOT BEEN SINCE A MOMENT'S
DELAY. HOW IMPATIENT, HOW ANXIOUS, HOW WILD I HAVE BEEN ON THE SUBJECT,
I WILL NOT ATTEMPT TO DESCRIBE; HOW SEVERELY MORTIFIED, HOW CRUELLY
DISAPPOINTED, IN NOT HAVING IT FINISHED WHILE I WAS IN LONDON! I WAS
KEPT THERE FROM DAY TO DAY IN THE HOPE OF IT, FOR NOTHING LESS DEAR
TO ME THAN SUCH AN OBJECT WOULD HAVE DETAINED ME HALF THE TIME FROM
MANSFIELD. BUT THOUGH MY UNCLE ENTERED INTO MY WISHES WITH ALL THE
WARMTH I COULD DESIRE, AND EXERTED HIMSELF IMMEDIATELY, THERE WERE
DIFFICULTIES FROM THE ABSENCE OF ONE FRIEND, AND THE ENGAGEMENTS OF
ANOTHER, WHICH AT LAST I COULD NO LONGER BEAR TO STAY THE END OF, AND
KNOWING IN WHAT GOOD HANDS I LEFT THE CAUSE, I CAME AWAY ON MONDAY,
TRUSTING THAT MANY POSTS WOULD NOT PASS BEFORE I SHOULD BE FOLLOWED BY
SUCH VERY LETTERS AS THESE. MY UNCLE, WHO IS THE VERY BEST MAN IN
THE WORLD, HAS EXERTED HIMSELF, AS I KNEW HE WOULD, AFTER SEEING YOUR
BROTHER. HE WAS DELIGHTED WITH HIM. I WOULD NOT ALLOW MYSELF YESTERDAY
TO SAY HOW DELIGHTED, OR TO REPEAT HALF THAT THE ADMIRAL SAID IN HIS
PRAISE. I DEFERRED IT ALL TILL HIS PRAISE SHOULD BE PROVED THE PRAISE OF
A FRIEND, AS THIS DAY DOES PROVE IT. NOW I MAY SAY THAT EVEN I COULD
NOT REQUIRE WILLIAM PRICE TO EXCITE A GREATER INTEREST, OR BE FOLLOWED
BY WARMER WISHES AND HIGHER COMMENDATION, THAN WERE MOST VOLUNTARILY
BESTOWED BY MY UNCLE AFTER THE EVENING THEY HAD PASSED TOGETHER."

"HAS THIS BEEN ALL YOUR DOING, THEN?" CRIED FANNY. "GOOD HEAVEN! HOW
VERY, VERY KIND! HAVE YOU REALLY--WAS IT BY YOUR DESIRE? I BEG YOUR
PARDON, BUT I AM BEWILDERED. DID ADMIRAL CRAWFORD APPLY? HOW WAS IT? I
AM STUPEFIED."

HENRY WAS MOST HAPPY TO MAKE IT MORE INTELLIGIBLE, BY BEGINNING AT AN
EARLIER STAGE, AND EXPLAINING VERY PARTICULARLY WHAT HE HAD DONE. HIS
LAST JOURNEY TO LONDON HAD BEEN UNDERTAKEN WITH NO OTHER VIEW THAN THAT
OF INTRODUCING HER BROTHER IN HILL STREET, AND PREVAILING ON THE ADMIRAL
TO EXERT WHATEVER INTEREST HE MIGHT HAVE FOR GETTING HIM ON. THIS HAD
BEEN HIS BUSINESS. HE HAD COMMUNICATED IT TO NO CREATURE: HE HAD NOT
BREATHED A SYLLABLE OF IT EVEN TO MARY; WHILE UNCERTAIN OF THE ISSUE,
HE COULD NOT HAVE BORNE ANY PARTICIPATION OF HIS FEELINGS, BUT THIS HAD
BEEN HIS BUSINESS; AND HE SPOKE WITH SUCH A GLOW OF WHAT HIS SOLICITUDE
HAD BEEN, AND USED SUCH STRONG EXPRESSIONS, WAS SO ABOUNDING IN THE
DEEPEST INTEREST, IN TWOFOLD MOTIVES, IN VIEWS AND WISHES
MORE THAN COULD BE TOLD, THAT FANNY COULD NOT HAVE REMAINED
INSENSIBLE OF HIS DRIFT, HAD SHE BEEN ABLE TO ATTEND; BUT HER HEART WAS
SO FULL AND HER SENSES STILL SO ASTONISHED, THAT SHE COULD LISTEN BUT
IMPERFECTLY EVEN TO WHAT HE TOLD HER OF WILLIAM, AND SAYING ONLY WHEN
HE PAUSED, "HOW KIND! HOW VERY KIND! OH, MR. CRAWFORD, WE ARE INFINITELY
OBLIGED TO YOU! DEAREST, DEAREST WILLIAM!" SHE JUMPED UP AND MOVED IN
HASTE TOWARDS THE DOOR, CRYING OUT, "I WILL GO TO MY UNCLE. MY UNCLE
OUGHT TO KNOW IT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE." BUT THIS COULD NOT BE SUFFERED.
THE OPPORTUNITY WAS TOO FAIR, AND HIS FEELINGS TOO IMPATIENT. HE WAS
AFTER HER IMMEDIATELY. "SHE MUST NOT GO, SHE MUST ALLOW HIM FIVE MINUTES
LONGER," AND HE TOOK HER HAND AND LED HER BACK TO HER SEAT, AND WAS IN
THE MIDDLE OF HIS FARTHER EXPLANATION, BEFORE SHE HAD SUSPECTED FOR WHAT
SHE WAS DETAINED. WHEN SHE DID UNDERSTAND IT, HOWEVER, AND FOUND HERSELF
EXPECTED TO BELIEVE THAT SHE HAD CREATED SENSATIONS WHICH HIS HEART HAD
NEVER KNOWN BEFORE, AND THAT EVERYTHING HE HAD DONE FOR WILLIAM WAS TO
BE PLACED TO THE ACCOUNT OF HIS EXCESSIVE AND UNEQUALLED ATTACHMENT
TO HER, SHE WAS EXCEEDINGLY DISTRESSED, AND FOR SOME MOMENTS UNABLE
TO SPEAK. SHE CONSIDERED IT ALL AS NONSENSE, AS MERE TRIFLING AND
GALLANTRY, WHICH MEANT ONLY TO DECEIVE FOR THE HOUR; SHE COULD NOT BUT
FEEL THAT IT WAS TREATING HER IMPROPERLY AND UNWORTHILY, AND IN SUCH A
WAY AS SHE HAD NOT DESERVED; BUT IT WAS LIKE HIMSELF, AND ENTIRELY OF A
PIECE WITH WHAT SHE HAD SEEN BEFORE; AND SHE WOULD NOT ALLOW HERSELF TO
SHEW HALF THE DISPLEASURE SHE FELT, BECAUSE HE HAD BEEN CONFERRING AN
OBLIGATION, WHICH NO WANT OF DELICACY ON HIS PART COULD MAKE A TRIFLE
TO HER. WHILE HER HEART WAS STILL BOUNDING WITH JOY AND GRATITUDE ON
WILLIAM'S BEHALF, SHE COULD NOT BE SEVERELY RESENTFUL OF ANYTHING THAT
INJURED ONLY HERSELF; AND AFTER HAVING TWICE DRAWN BACK HER HAND, AND
TWICE ATTEMPTED IN VAIN TO TURN AWAY FROM HIM, SHE GOT UP, AND SAID
ONLY, WITH MUCH AGITATION, "DON'T, MR. CRAWFORD, PRAY DON'T! I BEG YOU
WOULD NOT. THIS IS A SORT OF TALKING WHICH IS VERY UNPLEASANT TO ME. I
MUST GO AWAY. I CANNOT BEAR IT." BUT HE WAS STILL TALKING ON, DESCRIBING
HIS AFFECTION, SOLICITING A RETURN, AND, FINALLY, IN WORDS SO PLAIN AS
TO BEAR BUT ONE MEANING EVEN TO HER, OFFERING HIMSELF, HAND, FORTUNE,
EVERYTHING, TO HER ACCEPTANCE. IT WAS SO; HE HAD SAID IT. HER
ASTONISHMENT AND CONFUSION INCREASED; AND THOUGH STILL NOT KNOWING
HOW TO SUPPOSE HIM SERIOUS, SHE COULD HARDLY STAND. HE PRESSED FOR AN
ANSWER.

"NO, NO, NO!" SHE CRIED, HIDING HER FACE. "THIS IS ALL NONSENSE. DO NOT
DISTRESS ME. I CAN HEAR NO MORE OF THIS. YOUR KINDNESS TO WILLIAM MAKES
ME MORE OBLIGED TO YOU THAN WORDS CAN EXPRESS; BUT I DO NOT WANT, I
CANNOT BEAR, I MUST NOT LISTEN TO SUCH--NO, NO, DON'T THINK OF ME. BUT
YOU ARE NOT THINKING OF ME. I KNOW IT IS ALL NOTHING."

SHE HAD BURST AWAY FROM HIM, AND AT THAT MOMENT SIR THOMAS WAS HEARD
SPEAKING TO A SERVANT IN HIS WAY TOWARDS THE ROOM THEY WERE IN. IT WAS
NO TIME FOR FARTHER ASSURANCES OR ENTREATY, THOUGH TO PART WITH HER AT
A MOMENT WHEN HER MODESTY ALONE SEEMED, TO HIS SANGUINE AND PREASSURED
MIND, TO STAND IN THE WAY OF THE HAPPINESS HE SOUGHT, WAS A CRUEL
NECESSITY. SHE RUSHED OUT AT AN OPPOSITE DOOR FROM THE ONE HER UNCLE
WAS APPROACHING, AND WAS WALKING UP AND DOWN THE EAST ROOM IN THE
UTMOST CONFUSION OF CONTRARY FEELING, BEFORE SIR THOMAS'S POLITENESS
OR APOLOGIES WERE OVER, OR HE HAD REACHED THE BEGINNING OF THE JOYFUL
INTELLIGENCE WHICH HIS VISITOR CAME TO COMMUNICATE.

SHE WAS FEELING, THINKING, TREMBLING ABOUT EVERYTHING; AGITATED, HAPPY,
MISERABLE, INFINITELY OBLIGED, ABSOLUTELY ANGRY. IT WAS ALL BEYOND
BELIEF! HE WAS INEXCUSABLE, INCOMPREHENSIBLE! BUT SUCH WERE HIS HABITS
THAT HE COULD DO NOTHING WITHOUT A MIXTURE OF EVIL. HE HAD PREVIOUSLY
MADE HER THE HAPPIEST OF HUMAN BEINGS, AND NOW HE HAD INSULTED--SHE KNEW
NOT WHAT TO SAY, HOW TO CLASS, OR HOW TO REGARD IT. SHE WOULD NOT HAVE
HIM BE SERIOUS, AND YET WHAT COULD EXCUSE THE USE OF SUCH WORDS AND
OFFERS, IF THEY MEANT BUT TO TRIFLE?

BUT WILLIAM WAS A LIEUTENANT. THAT WAS A FACT BEYOND A DOUBT, AND
WITHOUT AN ALLOY. SHE WOULD THINK OF IT FOR EVER AND FORGET ALL THE
REST. MR. CRAWFORD WOULD CERTAINLY NEVER ADDRESS HER SO AGAIN: HE MUST
HAVE SEEN HOW UNWELCOME IT WAS TO HER; AND IN THAT CASE, HOW GRATEFULLY
SHE COULD ESTEEM HIM FOR HIS FRIENDSHIP TO WILLIAM!

SHE WOULD NOT STIR FARTHER FROM THE EAST ROOM THAN THE HEAD OF THE GREAT
STAIRCASE, TILL SHE HAD SATISFIED HERSELF OF MR. CRAWFORD'S HAVING LEFT
THE HOUSE; BUT WHEN CONVINCED OF HIS BEING GONE, SHE WAS EAGER TO GO
DOWN AND BE WITH HER UNCLE, AND HAVE ALL THE HAPPINESS OF HIS JOY
AS WELL AS HER OWN, AND ALL THE BENEFIT OF HIS INFORMATION OR HIS
CONJECTURES AS TO WHAT WOULD NOW BE WILLIAM'S DESTINATION. SIR THOMAS
WAS AS JOYFUL AS SHE COULD DESIRE, AND VERY KIND AND COMMUNICATIVE; AND
SHE HAD SO COMFORTABLE A TALK WITH HIM ABOUT WILLIAM AS TO MAKE HER
FEEL AS IF NOTHING HAD OCCURRED TO VEX HER, TILL SHE FOUND, TOWARDS THE
CLOSE, THAT MR. CRAWFORD WAS ENGAGED TO RETURN AND DINE THERE THAT
VERY DAY. THIS WAS A MOST UNWELCOME HEARING, FOR THOUGH HE MIGHT THINK
NOTHING OF WHAT HAD PASSED, IT WOULD BE QUITE DISTRESSING TO HER TO SEE
HIM AGAIN SO SOON.

SHE TRIED TO GET THE BETTER OF IT; TRIED VERY HARD, AS THE DINNER HOUR
APPROACHED, TO FEEL AND APPEAR AS USUAL; BUT IT WAS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE FOR
HER NOT TO LOOK MOST SHY AND UNCOMFORTABLE WHEN THEIR VISITOR ENTERED
THE ROOM. SHE COULD NOT HAVE SUPPOSED IT IN THE POWER OF ANY CONCURRENCE
OF CIRCUMSTANCES TO GIVE HER SO MANY PAINFUL SENSATIONS ON THE FIRST DAY
OF HEARING OF WILLIAM'S PROMOTION.

MR. CRAWFORD WAS NOT ONLY IN THE ROOM--HE WAS SOON CLOSE TO HER. HE
HAD A NOTE TO DELIVER FROM HIS SISTER. FANNY COULD NOT LOOK AT HIM, BUT
THERE WAS NO CONSCIOUSNESS OF PAST FOLLY IN HIS VOICE. SHE OPENED HER
NOTE IMMEDIATELY, GLAD TO HAVE ANYTHING TO DO, AND HAPPY, AS SHE READ
IT, TO FEEL THAT THE FIDGETINGS OF HER AUNT NORRIS, WHO WAS ALSO TO DINE
THERE, SCREENED HER A LITTLE FROM VIEW.

"MY DEAR FANNY,--FOR SO I MAY NOW ALWAYS CALL YOU, TO THE INFINITE
RELIEF OF A TONGUE THAT HAS BEEN STUMBLING AT MISS PRICE FOR AT
LEAST THE LAST SIX WEEKS--I CANNOT LET MY BROTHER GO WITHOUT SENDING YOU
A FEW LINES OF GENERAL CONGRATULATION, AND GIVING MY MOST JOYFUL CONSENT
AND APPROVAL. GO ON, MY DEAR FANNY, AND WITHOUT FEAR; THERE CAN BE NO
DIFFICULTIES WORTH NAMING. I CHUSE TO SUPPOSE THAT THE ASSURANCE OF MY
CONSENT WILL BE SOMETHING; SO YOU MAY SMILE UPON HIM WITH YOUR SWEETEST
SMILES THIS AFTERNOON, AND SEND HIM BACK TO ME EVEN HAPPIER THAN HE
GOES.--YOURS AFFECTIONATELY, M. C."

THESE WERE NOT EXPRESSIONS TO DO FANNY ANY GOOD; FOR THOUGH SHE READ
IN TOO MUCH HASTE AND CONFUSION TO FORM THE CLEAREST JUDGMENT OF MISS
CRAWFORD'S MEANING, IT WAS EVIDENT THAT SHE MEANT TO COMPLIMENT HER ON
HER BROTHER'S ATTACHMENT, AND EVEN TO APPEAR TO BELIEVE IT SERIOUS.
SHE DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO, OR WHAT TO THINK. THERE WAS WRETCHEDNESS IN
THE IDEA OF ITS BEING SERIOUS; THERE WAS PERPLEXITY AND AGITATION EVERY
WAY. SHE WAS DISTRESSED WHENEVER MR. CRAWFORD SPOKE TO HER, AND HE SPOKE
TO HER MUCH TOO OFTEN; AND SHE WAS AFRAID THERE WAS A SOMETHING IN HIS
VOICE AND MANNER IN ADDRESSING HER VERY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT THEY WERE
WHEN HE TALKED TO THE OTHERS. HER COMFORT IN THAT DAY'S DINNER WAS
QUITE DESTROYED: SHE COULD HARDLY EAT ANYTHING; AND WHEN SIR THOMAS
GOOD-HUMOUREDLY OBSERVED THAT JOY HAD TAKEN AWAY HER APPETITE, SHE
WAS READY TO SINK WITH SHAME, FROM THE DREAD OF MR. CRAWFORD'S
INTERPRETATION; FOR THOUGH NOTHING COULD HAVE TEMPTED HER TO TURN
HER EYES TO THE RIGHT HAND, WHERE HE SAT, SHE FELT THAT HIS WERE
IMMEDIATELY DIRECTED TOWARDS HER.

SHE WAS MORE SILENT THAN EVER. SHE WOULD HARDLY JOIN EVEN WHEN WILLIAM
WAS THE SUBJECT, FOR HIS COMMISSION CAME ALL FROM THE RIGHT HAND TOO,
AND THERE WAS PAIN IN THE CONNEXION.

SHE THOUGHT LADY BERTRAM SAT LONGER THAN EVER, AND BEGAN TO BE IN
DESPAIR OF EVER GETTING AWAY; BUT AT LAST THEY WERE IN THE DRAWING-ROOM,
AND SHE WAS ABLE TO THINK AS SHE WOULD, WHILE HER AUNTS FINISHED THE
SUBJECT OF WILLIAM'S APPOINTMENT IN THEIR OWN STYLE.

MRS. NORRIS SEEMED AS MUCH DELIGHTED WITH THE SAVING IT WOULD BE TO
SIR THOMAS AS WITH ANY PART OF IT. "NOW WILLIAM WOULD BE ABLE TO KEEP
HIMSELF, WHICH WOULD MAKE A VAST DIFFERENCE TO HIS UNCLE, FOR IT WAS
UNKNOWN HOW MUCH HE HAD COST HIS UNCLE; AND, INDEED, IT WOULD MAKE SOME
DIFFERENCE IN HER PRESENTS TOO. SHE WAS VERY GLAD THAT SHE HAD GIVEN
WILLIAM WHAT SHE DID AT PARTING, VERY GLAD, INDEED, THAT IT HAD BEEN IN
HER POWER, WITHOUT MATERIAL INCONVENIENCE, JUST AT THAT TIME TO GIVE HIM
SOMETHING RATHER CONSIDERABLE; THAT IS, FOR HER, WITH HER LIMITED
MEANS, FOR NOW IT WOULD ALL BE USEFUL IN HELPING TO FIT UP HIS CABIN.
SHE KNEW HE MUST BE AT SOME EXPENSE, THAT HE WOULD HAVE MANY THINGS TO
BUY, THOUGH TO BE SURE HIS FATHER AND MOTHER WOULD BE ABLE TO PUT HIM IN
THE WAY OF GETTING EVERYTHING VERY CHEAP; BUT SHE WAS VERY GLAD SHE HAD
CONTRIBUTED HER MITE TOWARDS IT."

"I AM GLAD YOU GAVE HIM SOMETHING CONSIDERABLE," SAID LADY BERTRAM, WITH
MOST UNSUSPICIOUS CALMNESS, "FOR I GAVE HIM ONLY 10."

"INDEED!" CRIED MRS. NORRIS, REDDENING. "UPON MY WORD, HE MUST HAVE GONE
OFF WITH HIS POCKETS WELL LINED, AND AT NO EXPENSE FOR HIS JOURNEY TO
LONDON EITHER!"

"SIR THOMAS TOLD ME 10 WOULD BE ENOUGH."

MRS. NORRIS, BEING NOT AT ALL INCLINED TO QUESTION ITS SUFFICIENCY,
BEGAN TO TAKE THE MATTER IN ANOTHER POINT.

"IT IS AMAZING," SAID SHE, "HOW MUCH YOUNG PEOPLE COST THEIR FRIENDS,
WHAT WITH BRINGING THEM UP AND PUTTING THEM OUT IN THE WORLD! THEY
LITTLE THINK HOW MUCH IT COMES TO, OR WHAT THEIR PARENTS, OR THEIR
UNCLES AND AUNTS, PAY FOR THEM IN THE COURSE OF THE YEAR. NOW, HERE ARE
MY SISTER PRICE'S CHILDREN; TAKE THEM ALL TOGETHER, I DARE SAY NOBODY
WOULD BELIEVE WHAT A SUM THEY COST SIR THOMAS EVERY YEAR, TO SAY NOTHING
OF WHAT I DO FOR THEM."

"VERY TRUE, SISTER, AS YOU SAY. BUT, POOR THINGS! THEY CANNOT HELP
IT; AND YOU KNOW IT MAKES VERY LITTLE DIFFERENCE TO SIR THOMAS. FANNY,
WILLIAM MUST NOT FORGET MY SHAWL IF HE GOES TO THE EAST INDIES; AND I
SHALL GIVE HIM A COMMISSION FOR ANYTHING ELSE THAT IS WORTH HAVING. I
WISH HE MAY GO TO THE EAST INDIES, THAT I MAY HAVE MY SHAWL. I THINK I
WILL HAVE TWO SHAWLS, FANNY."

FANNY, MEANWHILE, SPEAKING ONLY WHEN SHE COULD NOT HELP IT, WAS VERY
EARNESTLY TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT MR. AND MISS CRAWFORD WERE AT. THERE
WAS EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD AGAINST THEIR BEING SERIOUS BUT HIS WORDS
AND MANNER. EVERYTHING NATURAL, PROBABLE, REASONABLE, WAS AGAINST IT;
ALL THEIR HABITS AND WAYS OF THINKING, AND ALL HER OWN DEMERITS. HOW
COULD SHE HAVE EXCITED SERIOUS ATTACHMENT IN A MAN WHO HAD SEEN SO
MANY, AND BEEN ADMIRED BY SO MANY, AND FLIRTED WITH SO MANY, INFINITELY
HER SUPERIORS; WHO SEEMED SO LITTLE OPEN TO SERIOUS IMPRESSIONS, EVEN
WHERE PAINS HAD BEEN TAKEN TO PLEASE HIM; WHO THOUGHT SO SLIGHTLY, SO
CARELESSLY, SO UNFEELINGLY ON ALL SUCH POINTS; WHO WAS EVERYTHING TO
EVERYBODY, AND SEEMED TO FIND NO ONE ESSENTIAL TO HIM? AND FARTHER,
HOW COULD IT BE SUPPOSED THAT HIS SISTER, WITH ALL HER HIGH AND WORLDLY
NOTIONS OF MATRIMONY, WOULD BE FORWARDING ANYTHING OF A SERIOUS NATURE
IN SUCH A QUARTER? NOTHING COULD BE MORE UNNATURAL IN EITHER. FANNY
WAS ASHAMED OF HER OWN DOUBTS. EVERYTHING MIGHT BE POSSIBLE RATHER THAN
SERIOUS ATTACHMENT, OR SERIOUS APPROBATION OF IT TOWARD HER. SHE HAD
QUITE CONVINCED HERSELF OF THIS BEFORE SIR THOMAS AND MR. CRAWFORD
JOINED THEM. THE DIFFICULTY WAS IN MAINTAINING THE CONVICTION QUITE SO
ABSOLUTELY AFTER MR. CRAWFORD WAS IN THE ROOM; FOR ONCE OR TWICE A
LOOK SEEMED FORCED ON HER WHICH SHE DID NOT KNOW HOW TO CLASS AMONG THE
COMMON MEANING; IN ANY OTHER MAN, AT LEAST, SHE WOULD HAVE SAID THAT
IT MEANT SOMETHING VERY EARNEST, VERY POINTED. BUT SHE STILL TRIED TO
BELIEVE IT NO MORE THAN WHAT HE MIGHT OFTEN HAVE EXPRESSED TOWARDS HER
COUSINS AND FIFTY OTHER WOMEN.

SHE THOUGHT HE WAS WISHING TO SPEAK TO HER UNHEARD BY THE REST. SHE
FANCIED HE WAS TRYING FOR IT THE WHOLE EVENING AT INTERVALS, WHENEVER
SIR THOMAS WAS OUT OF THE ROOM, OR AT ALL ENGAGED WITH MRS. NORRIS, AND
SHE CAREFULLY REFUSED HIM EVERY OPPORTUNITY.

AT LAST--IT SEEMED AN AT LAST TO FANNY'S NERVOUSNESS, THOUGH NOT
REMARKABLY LATE--HE BEGAN TO TALK OF GOING AWAY; BUT THE COMFORT OF THE
SOUND WAS IMPAIRED BY HIS TURNING TO HER THE NEXT MOMENT, AND SAYING,
"HAVE YOU NOTHING TO SEND TO MARY? NO ANSWER TO HER NOTE? SHE WILL BE
DISAPPOINTED IF SHE RECEIVES NOTHING FROM YOU. PRAY WRITE TO HER, IF IT
BE ONLY A LINE."

"OH YES! CERTAINLY," CRIED FANNY, RISING IN HASTE, THE HASTE OF
EMBARRASSMENT AND OF WANTING TO GET AWAY--"I WILL WRITE DIRECTLY."

SHE WENT ACCORDINGLY TO THE TABLE, WHERE SHE WAS IN THE HABIT OF WRITING
FOR HER AUNT, AND PREPARED HER MATERIALS WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT IN THE
WORLD TO SAY. SHE HAD READ MISS CRAWFORD'S NOTE ONLY ONCE, AND HOW TO
REPLY TO ANYTHING SO IMPERFECTLY UNDERSTOOD WAS MOST DISTRESSING.
QUITE UNPRACTISED IN SUCH SORT OF NOTE-WRITING, HAD THERE BEEN TIME FOR
SCRUPLES AND FEARS AS TO STYLE SHE WOULD HAVE FELT THEM IN ABUNDANCE:
BUT SOMETHING MUST BE INSTANTLY WRITTEN; AND WITH ONLY ONE DECIDED
FEELING, THAT OF WISHING NOT TO APPEAR TO THINK ANYTHING REALLY
INTENDED, SHE WROTE THUS, IN GREAT TREMBLING BOTH OF SPIRITS AND HAND--

"I AM VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU, MY DEAR MISS CRAWFORD, FOR YOUR KIND
CONGRATULATIONS, AS FAR AS THEY RELATE TO MY DEAREST WILLIAM. THE REST
OF YOUR NOTE I KNOW MEANS NOTHING; BUT I AM SO UNEQUAL TO ANYTHING OF
THE SORT, THAT I HOPE YOU WILL EXCUSE MY BEGGING YOU TO TAKE NO FARTHER
NOTICE. I HAVE SEEN TOO MUCH OF MR. CRAWFORD NOT TO UNDERSTAND HIS
MANNERS; IF HE UNDERSTOOD ME AS WELL, HE WOULD, I DARE SAY, BEHAVE
DIFFERENTLY. I DO NOT KNOW WHAT I WRITE, BUT IT WOULD BE A GREAT FAVOUR
OF YOU NEVER TO MENTION THE SUBJECT AGAIN. WITH THANKS FOR THE HONOUR OF
YOUR NOTE, I REMAIN, DEAR MISS CRAWFORD, ETC., ETC."

THE CONCLUSION WAS SCARCELY INTELLIGIBLE FROM INCREASING FRIGHT, FOR
SHE FOUND THAT MR. CRAWFORD, UNDER PRETENCE OF RECEIVING THE NOTE, WAS
COMING TOWARDS HER.

"YOU CANNOT THINK I MEAN TO HURRY YOU," SAID HE, IN AN UNDERVOICE,
PERCEIVING THE AMAZING TREPIDATION WITH WHICH SHE MADE UP THE NOTE, "YOU
CANNOT THINK I HAVE ANY SUCH OBJECT. DO NOT HURRY YOURSELF, I ENTREAT."

"OH! I THANK YOU; I HAVE QUITE DONE, JUST DONE; IT WILL BE READY IN A
MOMENT; I AM VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU; IF YOU WILL BE SO GOOD AS TO GIVE
THAT TO MISS CRAWFORD."

THE NOTE WAS HELD OUT, AND MUST BE TAKEN; AND AS SHE INSTANTLY AND WITH
AVERTED EYES WALKED TOWARDS THE FIREPLACE, WHERE SAT THE OTHERS, HE HAD
NOTHING TO DO BUT TO GO IN GOOD EARNEST.

FANNY THOUGHT SHE HAD NEVER KNOWN A DAY OF GREATER AGITATION, BOTH OF
PAIN AND PLEASURE; BUT HAPPILY THE PLEASURE WAS NOT OF A SORT TO DIE
WITH THE DAY; FOR EVERY DAY WOULD RESTORE THE KNOWLEDGE OF WILLIAM'S
ADVANCEMENT, WHEREAS THE PAIN, SHE HOPED, WOULD RETURN NO MORE. SHE HAD
NO DOUBT THAT HER NOTE MUST APPEAR EXCESSIVELY ILL-WRITTEN, THAT
THE LANGUAGE WOULD DISGRACE A CHILD, FOR HER DISTRESS HAD ALLOWED NO
ARRANGEMENT; BUT AT LEAST IT WOULD ASSURE THEM BOTH OF HER BEING NEITHER
IMPOSED ON NOR GRATIFIED BY MR. CRAWFORD'S ATTENTIONS.



CHAPTER XXXII

FANNY HAD BY NO MEANS FORGOTTEN MR. CRAWFORD WHEN SHE AWOKE THE NEXT
MORNING; BUT SHE REMEMBERED THE PURPORT OF HER NOTE, AND WAS NOT LESS
SANGUINE AS TO ITS EFFECT THAN SHE HAD BEEN THE NIGHT BEFORE. IF MR.
CRAWFORD WOULD BUT GO AWAY! THAT WAS WHAT SHE MOST EARNESTLY DESIRED:
GO AND TAKE HIS SISTER WITH HIM, AS HE WAS TO DO, AND AS HE RETURNED TO
MANSFIELD ON PURPOSE TO DO. AND WHY IT WAS NOT DONE ALREADY SHE COULD
NOT DEVISE, FOR MISS CRAWFORD CERTAINLY WANTED NO DELAY. FANNY HAD
HOPED, IN THE COURSE OF HIS YESTERDAY'S VISIT, TO HEAR THE DAY NAMED;
BUT HE HAD ONLY SPOKEN OF THEIR JOURNEY AS WHAT WOULD TAKE PLACE ERE
LONG.

HAVING SO SATISFACTORILY SETTLED THE CONVICTION HER NOTE WOULD CONVEY,
SHE COULD NOT BUT BE ASTONISHED TO SEE MR. CRAWFORD, AS SHE ACCIDENTALLY
DID, COMING UP TO THE HOUSE AGAIN, AND AT AN HOUR AS EARLY AS THE DAY
BEFORE. HIS COMING MIGHT HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH HER, BUT SHE MUST AVOID
SEEING HIM IF POSSIBLE; AND BEING THEN ON HER WAY UPSTAIRS, SHE RESOLVED
THERE TO REMAIN, DURING THE WHOLE OF HIS VISIT, UNLESS ACTUALLY SENT
FOR; AND AS MRS. NORRIS WAS STILL IN THE HOUSE, THERE SEEMED LITTLE
DANGER OF HER BEING WANTED.

SHE SAT SOME TIME IN A GOOD DEAL OF AGITATION, LISTENING, TREMBLING, AND
FEARING TO BE SENT FOR EVERY MOMENT; BUT AS NO FOOTSTEPS APPROACHED THE
EAST ROOM, SHE GREW GRADUALLY COMPOSED, COULD SIT DOWN, AND BE ABLE TO
EMPLOY HERSELF, AND ABLE TO HOPE THAT MR. CRAWFORD HAD COME AND WOULD GO
WITHOUT HER BEING OBLIGED TO KNOW ANYTHING OF THE MATTER.

NEARLY HALF AN HOUR HAD PASSED, AND SHE WAS GROWING VERY COMFORTABLE,
WHEN SUDDENLY THE SOUND OF A STEP IN REGULAR APPROACH WAS HEARD; A HEAVY
STEP, AN UNUSUAL STEP IN THAT PART OF THE HOUSE: IT WAS HER UNCLE'S; SHE
KNEW IT AS WELL AS HIS VOICE; SHE HAD TREMBLED AT IT AS OFTEN, AND BEGAN
TO TREMBLE AGAIN, AT THE IDEA OF HIS COMING UP TO SPEAK TO HER, WHATEVER
MIGHT BE THE SUBJECT. IT WAS INDEED SIR THOMAS WHO OPENED THE DOOR AND
ASKED IF SHE WERE THERE, AND IF HE MIGHT COME IN. THE TERROR OF HIS
FORMER OCCASIONAL VISITS TO THAT ROOM SEEMED ALL RENEWED, AND SHE FELT
AS IF HE WERE GOING TO EXAMINE HER AGAIN IN FRENCH AND ENGLISH.

SHE WAS ALL ATTENTION, HOWEVER, IN PLACING A CHAIR FOR HIM, AND TRYING
TO APPEAR HONOURED; AND, IN HER AGITATION, HAD QUITE OVERLOOKED THE
DEFICIENCIES OF HER APARTMENT, TILL HE, STOPPING SHORT AS HE ENTERED,
SAID, WITH MUCH SURPRISE, "WHY HAVE YOU NO FIRE TO-DAY?"

THERE WAS SNOW ON THE GROUND, AND SHE WAS SITTING IN A SHAWL. SHE
HESITATED.

"I AM NOT COLD, SIR: I NEVER SIT HERE LONG AT THIS TIME OF YEAR."

"BUT YOU HAVE A FIRE IN GENERAL?"

"NO, SIR."

"HOW COMES THIS ABOUT? HERE MUST BE SOME MISTAKE. I UNDERSTOOD THAT YOU
HAD THE USE OF THIS ROOM BY WAY OF MAKING YOU PERFECTLY COMFORTABLE.
IN YOUR BEDCHAMBER I KNOW YOU CANNOT HAVE A FIRE. HERE IS SOME GREAT
MISAPPREHENSION WHICH MUST BE RECTIFIED. IT IS HIGHLY UNFIT FOR YOU TO
SIT, BE IT ONLY HALF AN HOUR A DAY, WITHOUT A FIRE. YOU ARE NOT STRONG.
YOU ARE CHILLY. YOUR AUNT CANNOT BE AWARE OF THIS."

FANNY WOULD RATHER HAVE BEEN SILENT; BUT BEING OBLIGED TO SPEAK, SHE
COULD NOT FORBEAR, IN JUSTICE TO THE AUNT SHE LOVED BEST, FROM SAYING
SOMETHING IN WHICH THE WORDS "MY AUNT NORRIS" WERE DISTINGUISHABLE.

"I UNDERSTAND," CRIED HER UNCLE, RECOLLECTING HIMSELF, AND NOT WANTING
TO HEAR MORE: "I UNDERSTAND. YOUR AUNT NORRIS HAS ALWAYS BEEN AN
ADVOCATE, AND VERY JUDICIOUSLY, FOR YOUNG PEOPLE'S BEING BROUGHT UP
WITHOUT UNNECESSARY INDULGENCES; BUT THERE SHOULD BE MODERATION IN
EVERYTHING. SHE IS ALSO VERY HARDY HERSELF, WHICH OF COURSE WILL
INFLUENCE HER IN HER OPINION OF THE WANTS OF OTHERS. AND ON ANOTHER
ACCOUNT, TOO, I CAN PERFECTLY COMPREHEND. I KNOW WHAT HER SENTIMENTS
HAVE ALWAYS BEEN. THE PRINCIPLE WAS GOOD IN ITSELF, BUT IT MAY HAVE
BEEN, AND I BELIEVE HAS BEEN, CARRIED TOO FAR IN YOUR CASE. I
AM AWARE THAT THERE HAS BEEN SOMETIMES, IN SOME POINTS, A MISPLACED
DISTINCTION; BUT I THINK TOO WELL OF YOU, FANNY, TO SUPPOSE YOU WILL
EVER HARBOUR RESENTMENT ON THAT ACCOUNT. YOU HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING
WHICH WILL PREVENT YOU FROM RECEIVING THINGS ONLY IN PART, AND JUDGING
PARTIALLY BY THE EVENT. YOU WILL TAKE IN THE WHOLE OF THE PAST, YOU
WILL CONSIDER TIMES, PERSONS, AND PROBABILITIES, AND YOU WILL FEEL THAT
THEY WERE NOT LEAST YOUR FRIENDS WHO WERE EDUCATING AND PREPARING YOU
FOR THAT MEDIOCRITY OF CONDITION WHICH SEEMED TO BE YOUR LOT. THOUGH
THEIR CAUTION MAY PROVE EVENTUALLY UNNECESSARY, IT WAS KINDLY MEANT; AND
OF THIS YOU MAY BE ASSURED, THAT EVERY ADVANTAGE OF AFFLUENCE WILL BE
DOUBLED BY THE LITTLE PRIVATIONS AND RESTRICTIONS THAT MAY HAVE BEEN
IMPOSED. I AM SURE YOU WILL NOT DISAPPOINT MY OPINION OF YOU, BY FAILING
AT ANY TIME TO TREAT YOUR AUNT NORRIS WITH THE RESPECT AND ATTENTION
THAT ARE DUE TO HER. BUT ENOUGH OF THIS. SIT DOWN, MY DEAR. I MUST SPEAK
TO YOU FOR A FEW MINUTES, BUT I WILL NOT DETAIN YOU LONG."

FANNY OBEYED, WITH EYES CAST DOWN AND COLOUR RISING. AFTER A MOMENT'S
PAUSE, SIR THOMAS, TRYING TO SUPPRESS A SMILE, WENT ON.

"YOU ARE NOT AWARE, PERHAPS, THAT I HAVE HAD A VISITOR THIS MORNING. I
HAD NOT BEEN LONG IN MY OWN ROOM, AFTER BREAKFAST, WHEN MR. CRAWFORD WAS
SHEWN IN. HIS ERRAND YOU MAY PROBABLY CONJECTURE."

FANNY'S COLOUR GREW DEEPER AND DEEPER; AND HER UNCLE, PERCEIVING THAT
SHE WAS EMBARRASSED TO A DEGREE THAT MADE EITHER SPEAKING OR LOOKING
UP QUITE IMPOSSIBLE, TURNED AWAY HIS OWN EYES, AND WITHOUT ANY FARTHER
PAUSE PROCEEDED IN HIS ACCOUNT OF MR. CRAWFORD'S VISIT.

MR. CRAWFORD'S BUSINESS HAD BEEN TO DECLARE HIMSELF THE LOVER OF FANNY,
MAKE DECIDED PROPOSALS FOR HER, AND ENTREAT THE SANCTION OF THE UNCLE,
WHO SEEMED TO STAND IN THE PLACE OF HER PARENTS; AND HE HAD DONE IT ALL
SO WELL, SO OPENLY, SO LIBERALLY, SO PROPERLY, THAT SIR THOMAS, FEELING,
MOREOVER, HIS OWN REPLIES, AND HIS OWN REMARKS TO HAVE BEEN VERY MUCH
TO THE PURPOSE, WAS EXCEEDINGLY HAPPY TO GIVE THE PARTICULARS OF THEIR
CONVERSATION; AND LITTLE AWARE OF WHAT WAS PASSING IN HIS NIECE'S MIND,
CONCEIVED THAT BY SUCH DETAILS HE MUST BE GRATIFYING HER FAR MORE THAN
HIMSELF. HE TALKED, THEREFORE, FOR SEVERAL MINUTES WITHOUT FANNY'S
DARING TO INTERRUPT HIM. SHE HAD HARDLY EVEN ATTAINED THE WISH TO DO IT.
HER MIND WAS IN TOO MUCH CONFUSION. SHE HAD CHANGED HER POSITION; AND,
WITH HER EYES FIXED INTENTLY ON ONE OF THE WINDOWS, WAS LISTENING TO HER
UNCLE IN THE UTMOST PERTURBATION AND DISMAY. FOR A MOMENT HE CEASED, BUT
SHE HAD BARELY BECOME CONSCIOUS OF IT, WHEN, RISING FROM HIS CHAIR, HE
SAID, "AND NOW, FANNY, HAVING PERFORMED ONE PART OF MY COMMISSION,
AND SHEWN YOU EVERYTHING PLACED ON A BASIS THE MOST ASSURED AND
SATISFACTORY, I MAY EXECUTE THE REMAINDER BY PREVAILING ON YOU TO
ACCOMPANY ME DOWNSTAIRS, WHERE, THOUGH I CANNOT BUT PRESUME ON HAVING
BEEN NO UNACCEPTABLE COMPANION MYSELF, I MUST SUBMIT TO YOUR FINDING
ONE STILL BETTER WORTH LISTENING TO. MR. CRAWFORD, AS YOU HAVE PERHAPS
FORESEEN, IS YET IN THE HOUSE. HE IS IN MY ROOM, AND HOPING TO SEE YOU
THERE."

THERE WAS A LOOK, A START, AN EXCLAMATION ON HEARING THIS, WHICH
ASTONISHED SIR THOMAS; BUT WHAT WAS HIS INCREASE OF ASTONISHMENT ON
HEARING HER EXCLAIM--"OH! NO, SIR, I CANNOT, INDEED I CANNOT GO DOWN TO
HIM. MR. CRAWFORD OUGHT TO KNOW--HE MUST KNOW THAT: I TOLD HIM ENOUGH
YESTERDAY TO CONVINCE HIM; HE SPOKE TO ME ON THIS SUBJECT YESTERDAY,
AND I TOLD HIM WITHOUT DISGUISE THAT IT WAS VERY DISAGREEABLE TO ME, AND
QUITE OUT OF MY POWER TO RETURN HIS GOOD OPINION."

"I DO NOT CATCH YOUR MEANING," SAID SIR THOMAS, SITTING DOWN AGAIN. "OUT
OF YOUR POWER TO RETURN HIS GOOD OPINION? WHAT IS ALL THIS? I KNOW HE
SPOKE TO YOU YESTERDAY, AND (AS FAR AS I UNDERSTAND) RECEIVED AS MUCH
ENCOURAGEMENT TO PROCEED AS A WELL-JUDGING YOUNG WOMAN COULD PERMIT
HERSELF TO GIVE. I WAS VERY MUCH PLEASED WITH WHAT I COLLECTED TO HAVE
BEEN YOUR BEHAVIOUR ON THE OCCASION; IT SHEWED A DISCRETION HIGHLY TO
BE COMMENDED. BUT NOW, WHEN HE HAS MADE HIS OVERTURES SO PROPERLY, AND
HONOURABLY--WHAT ARE YOUR SCRUPLES NOW?"

"YOU ARE MISTAKEN, SIR," CRIED FANNY, FORCED BY THE ANXIETY OF THE
MOMENT EVEN TO TELL HER UNCLE THAT HE WAS WRONG; "YOU ARE QUITE
MISTAKEN. HOW COULD MR. CRAWFORD SAY SUCH A THING? I GAVE HIM NO
ENCOURAGEMENT YESTERDAY. ON THE CONTRARY, I TOLD HIM, I CANNOT RECOLLECT
MY EXACT WORDS, BUT I AM SURE I TOLD HIM THAT I WOULD NOT LISTEN TO HIM,
THAT IT WAS VERY UNPLEASANT TO ME IN EVERY RESPECT, AND THAT I BEGGED
HIM NEVER TO TALK TO ME IN THAT MANNER AGAIN. I AM SURE I SAID AS MUCH
AS THAT AND MORE; AND I SHOULD HAVE SAID STILL MORE, IF I HAD BEEN QUITE
CERTAIN OF HIS MEANING ANYTHING SERIOUSLY; BUT I DID NOT LIKE TO BE, I
COULD NOT BEAR TO BE, IMPUTING MORE THAN MIGHT BE INTENDED. I THOUGHT IT
MIGHT ALL PASS FOR NOTHING WITH HIM."

SHE COULD SAY NO MORE; HER BREATH WAS ALMOST GONE.

"AM I TO UNDERSTAND," SAID SIR THOMAS, AFTER A FEW MOMENTS' SILENCE,
"THAT YOU MEAN TO REFUSE MR. CRAWFORD?"

"YES, SIR."

"REFUSE HIM?"

"YES, SIR."

"REFUSE MR. CRAWFORD! UPON WHAT PLEA? FOR WHAT REASON?"

"I--I CANNOT LIKE HIM, SIR, WELL ENOUGH TO MARRY HIM."

"THIS IS VERY STRANGE!" SAID SIR THOMAS, IN A VOICE OF CALM DISPLEASURE.
"THERE IS SOMETHING IN THIS WHICH MY COMPREHENSION DOES NOT REACH. HERE
IS A YOUNG MAN WISHING TO PAY HIS ADDRESSES TO YOU, WITH EVERYTHING TO
RECOMMEND HIM: NOT MERELY SITUATION IN LIFE, FORTUNE, AND CHARACTER,
BUT WITH MORE THAN COMMON AGREEABLENESS, WITH ADDRESS AND CONVERSATION
PLEASING TO EVERYBODY. AND HE IS NOT AN ACQUAINTANCE OF TO-DAY; YOU HAVE
NOW KNOWN HIM SOME TIME. HIS SISTER, MOREOVER, IS YOUR INTIMATE FRIEND,
AND HE HAS BEEN DOING THAT FOR YOUR BROTHER, WHICH I SHOULD SUPPOSE
WOULD HAVE BEEN ALMOST SUFFICIENT RECOMMENDATION TO YOU, HAD THERE BEEN
NO OTHER. IT IS VERY UNCERTAIN WHEN MY INTEREST MIGHT HAVE GOT WILLIAM
ON. HE HAS DONE IT ALREADY."

"YES," SAID FANNY, IN A FAINT VOICE, AND LOOKING DOWN WITH FRESH SHAME;
AND SHE DID FEEL ALMOST ASHAMED OF HERSELF, AFTER SUCH A PICTURE AS HER
UNCLE HAD DRAWN, FOR NOT LIKING MR. CRAWFORD.

"YOU MUST HAVE BEEN AWARE," CONTINUED SIR THOMAS PRESENTLY, "YOU MUST
HAVE BEEN SOME TIME AWARE OF A PARTICULARITY IN MR. CRAWFORD'S MANNERS
TO YOU. THIS CANNOT HAVE TAKEN YOU BY SURPRISE. YOU MUST HAVE OBSERVED
HIS ATTENTIONS; AND THOUGH YOU ALWAYS RECEIVED THEM VERY PROPERLY (I
HAVE NO ACCUSATION TO MAKE ON THAT HEAD), I NEVER PERCEIVED THEM TO BE
UNPLEASANT TO YOU. I AM HALF INCLINED TO THINK, FANNY, THAT YOU DO NOT
QUITE KNOW YOUR OWN FEELINGS."

"OH YES, SIR! INDEED I DO. HIS ATTENTIONS WERE ALWAYS--WHAT I DID NOT
LIKE."

SIR THOMAS LOOKED AT HER WITH DEEPER SURPRISE. "THIS IS BEYOND ME,"
SAID HE. "THIS REQUIRES EXPLANATION. YOUNG AS YOU ARE, AND HAVING SEEN
SCARCELY ANY ONE, IT IS HARDLY POSSIBLE THAT YOUR AFFECTIONS--"

HE PAUSED AND EYED HER FIXEDLY. HE SAW HER LIPS FORMED INTO A NO,
THOUGH THE SOUND WAS INARTICULATE, BUT HER FACE WAS LIKE SCARLET. THAT,
HOWEVER, IN SO MODEST A GIRL, MIGHT BE VERY COMPATIBLE WITH INNOCENCE;
AND CHUSING AT LEAST TO APPEAR SATISFIED, HE QUICKLY ADDED, "NO, NO, I
KNOW THAT IS QUITE OUT OF THE QUESTION; QUITE IMPOSSIBLE. WELL, THERE
IS NOTHING MORE TO BE SAID."

AND FOR A FEW MINUTES HE DID SAY NOTHING. HE WAS DEEP IN THOUGHT. HIS
NIECE WAS DEEP IN THOUGHT LIKEWISE, TRYING TO HARDEN AND PREPARE HERSELF
AGAINST FARTHER QUESTIONING. SHE WOULD RATHER DIE THAN OWN THE TRUTH;
AND SHE HOPED, BY A LITTLE REFLECTION, TO FORTIFY HERSELF BEYOND
BETRAYING IT.

"INDEPENDENTLY OF THE INTEREST WHICH MR. CRAWFORD'S CHOICE SEEMED TO
JUSTIFY" SAID SIR THOMAS, BEGINNING AGAIN, AND VERY COMPOSEDLY, "HIS
WISHING TO MARRY AT ALL SO EARLY IS RECOMMENDATORY TO ME. I AM AN
ADVOCATE FOR EARLY MARRIAGES, WHERE THERE ARE MEANS IN PROPORTION, AND
WOULD HAVE EVERY YOUNG MAN, WITH A SUFFICIENT INCOME, SETTLE AS SOON
AFTER FOUR-AND-TWENTY AS HE CAN. THIS IS SO MUCH MY OPINION, THAT I AM
SORRY TO THINK HOW LITTLE LIKELY MY OWN ELDEST SON, YOUR COUSIN, MR.
BERTRAM, IS TO MARRY EARLY; BUT AT PRESENT, AS FAR AS I CAN JUDGE,
MATRIMONY MAKES NO PART OF HIS PLANS OR THOUGHTS. I WISH HE WERE MORE
LIKELY TO FIX." HERE WAS A GLANCE AT FANNY. "EDMUND, I CONSIDER, FROM
HIS DISPOSITIONS AND HABITS, AS MUCH MORE LIKELY TO MARRY EARLY THAN
HIS BROTHER. HE, INDEED, I HAVE LATELY THOUGHT, HAS SEEN THE WOMAN HE
COULD LOVE, WHICH, I AM CONVINCED, MY ELDEST SON HAS NOT. AM I RIGHT? DO
YOU AGREE WITH ME, MY DEAR?"

"YES, SIR."

IT WAS GENTLY, BUT IT WAS CALMLY SAID, AND SIR THOMAS WAS EASY ON THE
SCORE OF THE COUSINS. BUT THE REMOVAL OF HIS ALARM DID HIS NIECE
NO SERVICE: AS HER UNACCOUNTABLENESS WAS CONFIRMED HIS DISPLEASURE
INCREASED; AND GETTING UP AND WALKING ABOUT THE ROOM WITH A FROWN, WHICH
FANNY COULD PICTURE TO HERSELF, THOUGH SHE DARED NOT LIFT UP HER EYES,
HE SHORTLY AFTERWARDS, AND IN A VOICE OF AUTHORITY, SAID, "HAVE YOU ANY
REASON, CHILD, TO THINK ILL OF MR. CRAWFORD'S TEMPER?"

"NO, SIR."

SHE LONGED TO ADD, "BUT OF HIS PRINCIPLES I HAVE"; BUT HER HEART SUNK
UNDER THE APPALLING PROSPECT OF DISCUSSION, EXPLANATION, AND PROBABLY
NON-CONVICTION. HER ILL OPINION OF HIM WAS FOUNDED CHIEFLY ON
OBSERVATIONS, WHICH, FOR HER COUSINS' SAKE, SHE COULD SCARCELY DARE
MENTION TO THEIR FATHER. MARIA AND JULIA, AND ESPECIALLY MARIA, WERE SO
CLOSELY IMPLICATED IN MR. CRAWFORD'S MISCONDUCT, THAT SHE COULD NOT GIVE
HIS CHARACTER, SUCH AS SHE BELIEVED IT, WITHOUT BETRAYING THEM. SHE HAD
HOPED THAT, TO A MAN LIKE HER UNCLE, SO DISCERNING, SO HONOURABLE, SO
GOOD, THE SIMPLE ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF SETTLED DISLIKE ON HER SIDE WOULD
HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENT. TO HER INFINITE GRIEF SHE FOUND IT WAS NOT.

SIR THOMAS CAME TOWARDS THE TABLE WHERE SHE SAT IN TREMBLING
WRETCHEDNESS, AND WITH A GOOD DEAL OF COLD STERNNESS, SAID, "IT IS OF NO
USE, I PERCEIVE, TO TALK TO YOU. WE HAD BETTER PUT AN END TO THIS MOST
MORTIFYING CONFERENCE. MR. CRAWFORD MUST NOT BE KEPT LONGER WAITING. I
WILL, THEREFORE, ONLY ADD, AS THINKING IT MY DUTY TO MARK MY OPINION OF
YOUR CONDUCT, THAT YOU HAVE DISAPPOINTED EVERY EXPECTATION I HAD FORMED,
AND PROVED YOURSELF OF A CHARACTER THE VERY REVERSE OF WHAT I HAD
SUPPOSED. FOR I HAD, FANNY, AS I THINK MY BEHAVIOUR MUST HAVE SHEWN,
FORMED A VERY FAVOURABLE OPINION OF YOU FROM THE PERIOD OF MY RETURN TO
ENGLAND. I HAD THOUGHT YOU PECULIARLY FREE FROM WILFULNESS OF TEMPER,
SELF-CONCEIT, AND EVERY TENDENCY TO THAT INDEPENDENCE OF SPIRIT WHICH
PREVAILS SO MUCH IN MODERN DAYS, EVEN IN YOUNG WOMEN, AND WHICH IN YOUNG
WOMEN IS OFFENSIVE AND DISGUSTING BEYOND ALL COMMON OFFENCE. BUT YOU
HAVE NOW SHEWN ME THAT YOU CAN BE WILFUL AND PERVERSE; THAT YOU CAN AND
WILL DECIDE FOR YOURSELF, WITHOUT ANY CONSIDERATION OR DEFERENCE FOR
THOSE WHO HAVE SURELY SOME RIGHT TO GUIDE YOU, WITHOUT EVEN ASKING THEIR
ADVICE. YOU HAVE SHEWN YOURSELF VERY, VERY DIFFERENT FROM ANYTHING THAT
I HAD IMAGINED. THE ADVANTAGE OR DISADVANTAGE OF YOUR FAMILY, OF YOUR
PARENTS, YOUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS, NEVER SEEMS TO HAVE HAD A MOMENT'S
SHARE IN YOUR THOUGHTS ON THIS OCCASION. HOW THEY MIGHT BE BENEFITED,
HOW THEY MUST REJOICE IN SUCH AN ESTABLISHMENT FOR YOU, IS NOTHING TO
YOU. YOU THINK ONLY OF YOURSELF, AND BECAUSE YOU DO NOT FEEL FOR MR.
CRAWFORD EXACTLY WHAT A YOUNG HEATED FANCY IMAGINES TO BE NECESSARY FOR
HAPPINESS, YOU RESOLVE TO REFUSE HIM AT ONCE, WITHOUT WISHING EVEN FOR
A LITTLE TIME TO CONSIDER OF IT, A LITTLE MORE TIME FOR COOL
CONSIDERATION, AND FOR REALLY EXAMINING YOUR OWN INCLINATIONS; AND ARE,
IN A WILD FIT OF FOLLY, THROWING AWAY FROM YOU SUCH AN OPPORTUNITY OF
BEING SETTLED IN LIFE, ELIGIBLY, HONOURABLY, NOBLY SETTLED, AS WILL,
PROBABLY, NEVER OCCUR TO YOU AGAIN. HERE IS A YOUNG MAN OF SENSE, OF
CHARACTER, OF TEMPER, OF MANNERS, AND OF FORTUNE, EXCEEDINGLY ATTACHED
TO YOU, AND SEEKING YOUR HAND IN THE MOST HANDSOME AND DISINTERESTED
WAY; AND LET ME TELL YOU, FANNY, THAT YOU MAY LIVE EIGHTEEN YEARS LONGER
IN THE WORLD WITHOUT BEING ADDRESSED BY A MAN OF HALF MR. CRAWFORD'S
ESTATE, OR A TENTH PART OF HIS MERITS. GLADLY WOULD I HAVE BESTOWED
EITHER OF MY OWN DAUGHTERS ON HIM. MARIA IS NOBLY MARRIED; BUT HAD
MR. CRAWFORD SOUGHT JULIA'S HAND, I SHOULD HAVE GIVEN IT TO HIM WITH
SUPERIOR AND MORE HEARTFELT SATISFACTION THAN I GAVE MARIA'S TO MR.
RUSHWORTH." AFTER HALF A MOMENT'S PAUSE: "AND I SHOULD HAVE BEEN VERY
MUCH SURPRISED HAD EITHER OF MY DAUGHTERS, ON RECEIVING A PROPOSAL
OF MARRIAGE AT ANY TIME WHICH MIGHT CARRY WITH IT ONLY HALF THE
ELIGIBILITY OF THIS, IMMEDIATELY AND PEREMPTORILY, AND WITHOUT PAYING
MY OPINION OR MY REGARD THE COMPLIMENT OF ANY CONSULTATION, PUT A
DECIDED NEGATIVE ON IT. I SHOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH SURPRISED AND MUCH HURT
BY SUCH A PROCEEDING. I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT A GROSS VIOLATION OF DUTY
AND RESPECT. YOU ARE NOT TO BE JUDGED BY THE SAME RULE. YOU DO NOT
OWE ME THE DUTY OF A CHILD. BUT, FANNY, IF YOUR HEART CAN ACQUIT YOU OF
INGRATITUDE--"

HE CEASED. FANNY WAS BY THIS TIME CRYING SO BITTERLY THAT, ANGRY AS HE
WAS, HE WOULD NOT PRESS THAT ARTICLE FARTHER. HER HEART WAS ALMOST BROKE
BY SUCH A PICTURE OF WHAT SHE APPEARED TO HIM; BY SUCH ACCUSATIONS,
SO HEAVY, SO MULTIPLIED, SO RISING IN DREADFUL GRADATION! SELF-WILLED,
OBSTINATE, SELFISH, AND UNGRATEFUL. HE THOUGHT HER ALL THIS. SHE HAD
DECEIVED HIS EXPECTATIONS; SHE HAD LOST HIS GOOD OPINION. WHAT WAS TO
BECOME OF HER?

"I AM VERY SORRY," SAID SHE INARTICULATELY, THROUGH HER TEARS, "I AM
VERY SORRY INDEED."

"SORRY! YES, I HOPE YOU ARE SORRY; AND YOU WILL PROBABLY HAVE REASON TO
BE LONG SORRY FOR THIS DAY'S TRANSACTIONS."

"IF IT WERE POSSIBLE FOR ME TO DO OTHERWISE" SAID SHE, WITH ANOTHER
STRONG EFFORT; "BUT I AM SO PERFECTLY CONVINCED THAT I COULD NEVER MAKE
HIM HAPPY, AND THAT I SHOULD BE MISERABLE MYSELF."

ANOTHER BURST OF TEARS; BUT IN SPITE OF THAT BURST, AND IN SPITE OF THAT
GREAT BLACK WORD MISERABLE, WHICH SERVED TO INTRODUCE IT, SIR THOMAS
BEGAN TO THINK A LITTLE RELENTING, A LITTLE CHANGE OF INCLINATION, MIGHT
HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT; AND TO AUGUR FAVOURABLY FROM THE PERSONAL
ENTREATY OF THE YOUNG MAN HIMSELF. HE KNEW HER TO BE VERY TIMID, AND
EXCEEDINGLY NERVOUS; AND THOUGHT IT NOT IMPROBABLE THAT HER MIND
MIGHT BE IN SUCH A STATE AS A LITTLE TIME, A LITTLE PRESSING, A LITTLE
PATIENCE, AND A LITTLE IMPATIENCE, A JUDICIOUS MIXTURE OF ALL ON THE
LOVER'S SIDE, MIGHT WORK THEIR USUAL EFFECT ON. IF THE GENTLEMAN WOULD
BUT PERSEVERE, IF HE HAD BUT LOVE ENOUGH TO PERSEVERE, SIR THOMAS BEGAN
TO HAVE HOPES; AND THESE REFLECTIONS HAVING PASSED ACROSS HIS MIND AND
CHEERED IT, "WELL," SAID HE, IN A TONE OF BECOMING GRAVITY, BUT OF LESS
ANGER, "WELL, CHILD, DRY UP YOUR TEARS. THERE IS NO USE IN THESE TEARS;
THEY CAN DO NO GOOD. YOU MUST NOW COME DOWNSTAIRS WITH ME. MR. CRAWFORD
HAS BEEN KEPT WAITING TOO LONG ALREADY. YOU MUST GIVE HIM YOUR OWN
ANSWER: WE CANNOT EXPECT HIM TO BE SATISFIED WITH LESS; AND YOU ONLY
CAN EXPLAIN TO HIM THE GROUNDS OF THAT MISCONCEPTION OF YOUR SENTIMENTS,
WHICH, UNFORTUNATELY FOR HIMSELF, HE CERTAINLY HAS IMBIBED. I AM TOTALLY
UNEQUAL TO IT."

BUT FANNY SHEWED SUCH RELUCTANCE, SUCH MISERY, AT THE IDEA OF GOING DOWN
TO HIM, THAT SIR THOMAS, AFTER A LITTLE CONSIDERATION, JUDGED IT BETTER
TO INDULGE HER. HIS HOPES FROM BOTH GENTLEMAN AND LADY SUFFERED A SMALL
DEPRESSION IN CONSEQUENCE; BUT WHEN HE LOOKED AT HIS NIECE, AND SAW THE
STATE OF FEATURE AND COMPLEXION WHICH HER CRYING HAD BROUGHT HER
INTO, HE THOUGHT THERE MIGHT BE AS MUCH LOST AS GAINED BY AN IMMEDIATE
INTERVIEW. WITH A FEW WORDS, THEREFORE, OF NO PARTICULAR MEANING, HE
WALKED OFF BY HIMSELF, LEAVING HIS POOR NIECE TO SIT AND CRY OVER WHAT
HAD PASSED, WITH VERY WRETCHED FEELINGS.

HER MIND WAS ALL DISORDER. THE PAST, PRESENT, FUTURE, EVERYTHING WAS
TERRIBLE. BUT HER UNCLE'S ANGER GAVE HER THE SEVEREST PAIN OF ALL.
SELFISH AND UNGRATEFUL! TO HAVE APPEARED SO TO HIM! SHE WAS MISERABLE
FOR EVER. SHE HAD NO ONE TO TAKE HER PART, TO COUNSEL, OR SPEAK FOR HER.
HER ONLY FRIEND WAS ABSENT. HE MIGHT HAVE SOFTENED HIS FATHER; BUT ALL,
PERHAPS ALL, WOULD THINK HER SELFISH AND UNGRATEFUL. SHE MIGHT HAVE TO
ENDURE THE REPROACH AGAIN AND AGAIN; SHE MIGHT HEAR IT, OR SEE IT, OR
KNOW IT TO EXIST FOR EVER IN EVERY CONNEXION ABOUT HER. SHE COULD NOT
BUT FEEL SOME RESENTMENT AGAINST MR. CRAWFORD; YET, IF HE REALLY LOVED
HER, AND WERE UNHAPPY TOO! IT WAS ALL WRETCHEDNESS TOGETHER.

IN ABOUT A QUARTER OF AN HOUR HER UNCLE RETURNED; SHE WAS ALMOST
READY TO FAINT AT THE SIGHT OF HIM. HE SPOKE CALMLY, HOWEVER, WITHOUT
AUSTERITY, WITHOUT REPROACH, AND SHE REVIVED A LITTLE. THERE WAS
COMFORT, TOO, IN HIS WORDS, AS WELL AS HIS MANNER, FOR HE BEGAN WITH,
"MR. CRAWFORD IS GONE: HE HAS JUST LEFT ME. I NEED NOT REPEAT WHAT HAS
PASSED. I DO NOT WANT TO ADD TO ANYTHING YOU MAY NOW BE FEELING, BY AN
ACCOUNT OF WHAT HE HAS FELT. SUFFICE IT, THAT HE HAS BEHAVED IN THE
MOST GENTLEMANLIKE AND GENEROUS MANNER, AND HAS CONFIRMED ME IN A MOST
FAVOURABLE OPINION OF HIS UNDERSTANDING, HEART, AND TEMPER. UPON MY
REPRESENTATION OF WHAT YOU WERE SUFFERING, HE IMMEDIATELY, AND WITH THE
GREATEST DELICACY, CEASED TO URGE TO SEE YOU FOR THE PRESENT."

HERE FANNY, WHO HAD LOOKED UP, LOOKED DOWN AGAIN. "OF COURSE," CONTINUED
HER UNCLE, "IT CANNOT BE SUPPOSED BUT THAT HE SHOULD REQUEST TO SPEAK
WITH YOU ALONE, BE IT ONLY FOR FIVE MINUTES; A REQUEST TOO NATURAL,
A CLAIM TOO JUST TO BE DENIED. BUT THERE IS NO TIME FIXED; PERHAPS
TO-MORROW, OR WHENEVER YOUR SPIRITS ARE COMPOSED ENOUGH. FOR THE PRESENT
YOU HAVE ONLY TO TRANQUILLISE YOURSELF. CHECK THESE TEARS; THEY DO BUT
EXHAUST YOU. IF, AS I AM WILLING TO SUPPOSE, YOU WISH TO SHEW ME ANY
OBSERVANCE, YOU WILL NOT GIVE WAY TO THESE EMOTIONS, BUT ENDEAVOUR TO
REASON YOURSELF INTO A STRONGER FRAME OF MIND. I ADVISE YOU TO GO OUT:
THE AIR WILL DO YOU GOOD; GO OUT FOR AN HOUR ON THE GRAVEL; YOU WILL
HAVE THE SHRUBBERY TO YOURSELF, AND WILL BE THE BETTER FOR AIR AND
EXERCISE. AND, FANNY" (TURNING BACK AGAIN FOR A MOMENT), "I SHALL MAKE
NO MENTION BELOW OF WHAT HAS PASSED; I SHALL NOT EVEN TELL YOUR AUNT
BERTRAM. THERE IS NO OCCASION FOR SPREADING THE DISAPPOINTMENT; SAY
NOTHING ABOUT IT YOURSELF."

THIS WAS AN ORDER TO BE MOST JOYFULLY OBEYED; THIS WAS AN ACT OF
KINDNESS WHICH FANNY FELT AT HER HEART. TO BE SPARED FROM HER AUNT
NORRIS'S INTERMINABLE REPROACHES! HE LEFT HER IN A GLOW OF GRATITUDE.
ANYTHING MIGHT BE BEARABLE RATHER THAN SUCH REPROACHES. EVEN TO SEE MR.
CRAWFORD WOULD BE LESS OVERPOWERING.

SHE WALKED OUT DIRECTLY, AS HER UNCLE RECOMMENDED, AND FOLLOWED HIS
ADVICE THROUGHOUT, AS FAR AS SHE COULD; DID CHECK HER TEARS; DID
EARNESTLY TRY TO COMPOSE HER SPIRITS AND STRENGTHEN HER MIND. SHE WISHED
TO PROVE TO HIM THAT SHE DID DESIRE HIS COMFORT, AND SOUGHT TO REGAIN
HIS FAVOUR; AND HE HAD GIVEN HER ANOTHER STRONG MOTIVE FOR EXERTION, IN
KEEPING THE WHOLE AFFAIR FROM THE KNOWLEDGE OF HER AUNTS. NOT TO EXCITE
SUSPICION BY HER LOOK OR MANNER WAS NOW AN OBJECT WORTH ATTAINING; AND
SHE FELT EQUAL TO ALMOST ANYTHING THAT MIGHT SAVE HER FROM HER AUNT
NORRIS.

SHE WAS STRUCK, QUITE STRUCK, WHEN, ON RETURNING FROM HER WALK AND GOING
INTO THE EAST ROOM AGAIN, THE FIRST THING WHICH CAUGHT HER EYE WAS A
FIRE LIGHTED AND BURNING. A FIRE! IT SEEMED TOO MUCH; JUST AT THAT TIME
TO BE GIVING HER SUCH AN INDULGENCE WAS EXCITING EVEN PAINFUL GRATITUDE.
SHE WONDERED THAT SIR THOMAS COULD HAVE LEISURE TO THINK OF SUCH A
TRIFLE AGAIN; BUT SHE SOON FOUND, FROM THE VOLUNTARY INFORMATION OF THE
HOUSEMAID, WHO CAME IN TO ATTEND IT, THAT SO IT WAS TO BE EVERY DAY. SIR
THOMAS HAD GIVEN ORDERS FOR IT.

"I MUST BE A BRUTE, INDEED, IF I CAN BE REALLY UNGRATEFUL!" SAID SHE, IN
SOLILOQUY. "HEAVEN DEFEND ME FROM BEING UNGRATEFUL!"

SHE SAW NOTHING MORE OF HER UNCLE, NOR OF HER AUNT NORRIS, TILL THEY MET
AT DINNER. HER UNCLE'S BEHAVIOUR TO HER WAS THEN AS NEARLY AS POSSIBLE
WHAT IT HAD BEEN BEFORE; SHE WAS SURE HE DID NOT MEAN THERE SHOULD BE
ANY CHANGE, AND THAT IT WAS ONLY HER OWN CONSCIENCE THAT COULD FANCY
ANY; BUT HER AUNT WAS SOON QUARRELLING WITH HER; AND WHEN SHE FOUND HOW
MUCH AND HOW UNPLEASANTLY HER HAVING ONLY WALKED OUT WITHOUT HER AUNT'S
KNOWLEDGE COULD BE DWELT ON, SHE FELT ALL THE REASON SHE HAD TO BLESS
THE KINDNESS WHICH SAVED HER FROM THE SAME SPIRIT OF REPROACH, EXERTED
ON A MORE MOMENTOUS SUBJECT.

"IF I HAD KNOWN YOU WERE GOING OUT, I SHOULD HAVE GOT YOU JUST TO GO
AS FAR AS MY HOUSE WITH SOME ORDERS FOR NANNY," SAID SHE, "WHICH I HAVE
SINCE, TO MY VERY GREAT INCONVENIENCE, BEEN OBLIGED TO GO AND CARRY
MYSELF. I COULD VERY ILL SPARE THE TIME, AND YOU MIGHT HAVE SAVED ME THE
TROUBLE, IF YOU WOULD ONLY HAVE BEEN SO GOOD AS TO LET US KNOW YOU WERE
GOING OUT. IT WOULD HAVE MADE NO DIFFERENCE TO YOU, I SUPPOSE, WHETHER
YOU HAD WALKED IN THE SHRUBBERY OR GONE TO MY HOUSE."

"I RECOMMENDED THE SHRUBBERY TO FANNY AS THE DRIEST PLACE," SAID SIR
THOMAS.

"OH!" SAID MRS. NORRIS, WITH A MOMENT'S CHECK, "THAT WAS VERY KIND OF
YOU, SIR THOMAS; BUT YOU DO NOT KNOW HOW DRY THE PATH IS TO MY HOUSE.
FANNY WOULD HAVE HAD QUITE AS GOOD A WALK THERE, I ASSURE YOU, WITH THE
ADVANTAGE OF BEING OF SOME USE, AND OBLIGING HER AUNT: IT IS ALL HER
FAULT. IF SHE WOULD BUT HAVE LET US KNOW SHE WAS GOING OUT BUT THERE IS
A SOMETHING ABOUT FANNY, I HAVE OFTEN OBSERVED IT BEFORE--SHE LIKES TO
GO HER OWN WAY TO WORK; SHE DOES NOT LIKE TO BE DICTATED TO; SHE TAKES
HER OWN INDEPENDENT WALK WHENEVER SHE CAN; SHE CERTAINLY HAS A LITTLE
SPIRIT OF SECRECY, AND INDEPENDENCE, AND NONSENSE, ABOUT HER, WHICH I
WOULD ADVISE HER TO GET THE BETTER OF."

AS A GENERAL REFLECTION ON FANNY, SIR THOMAS THOUGHT NOTHING COULD BE
MORE UNJUST, THOUGH HE HAD BEEN SO LATELY EXPRESSING THE SAME SENTIMENTS
HIMSELF, AND HE TRIED TO TURN THE CONVERSATION: TRIED REPEATEDLY
BEFORE HE COULD SUCCEED; FOR MRS. NORRIS HAD NOT DISCERNMENT ENOUGH TO
PERCEIVE, EITHER NOW, OR AT ANY OTHER TIME, TO WHAT DEGREE HE THOUGHT
WELL OF HIS NIECE, OR HOW VERY FAR HE WAS FROM WISHING TO HAVE HIS OWN
CHILDREN'S MERITS SET OFF BY THE DEPRECIATION OF HERS. SHE WAS TALKING
AT FANNY, AND RESENTING THIS PRIVATE WALK HALF THROUGH THE DINNER.

IT WAS OVER, HOWEVER, AT LAST; AND THE EVENING SET IN WITH MORE
COMPOSURE TO FANNY, AND MORE CHEERFULNESS OF SPIRITS THAN SHE COULD
HAVE HOPED FOR AFTER SO STORMY A MORNING; BUT SHE TRUSTED, IN THE FIRST
PLACE, THAT SHE HAD DONE RIGHT: THAT HER JUDGMENT HAD NOT MISLED HER.
FOR THE PURITY OF HER INTENTIONS SHE COULD ANSWER; AND SHE WAS WILLING
TO HOPE, SECONDLY, THAT HER UNCLE'S DISPLEASURE WAS ABATING, AND WOULD
ABATE FARTHER AS HE CONSIDERED THE MATTER WITH MORE IMPARTIALITY, AND
FELT, AS A GOOD MAN MUST FEEL, HOW WRETCHED, AND HOW UNPARDONABLE, HOW
HOPELESS, AND HOW WICKED IT WAS TO MARRY WITHOUT AFFECTION.

WHEN THE MEETING WITH WHICH SHE WAS THREATENED FOR THE MORROW WAS PAST,
SHE COULD NOT BUT FLATTER HERSELF THAT THE SUBJECT WOULD BE FINALLY
CONCLUDED, AND MR. CRAWFORD ONCE GONE FROM MANSFIELD, THAT EVERYTHING
WOULD SOON BE AS IF NO SUCH SUBJECT HAD EXISTED. SHE WOULD NOT, COULD
NOT BELIEVE, THAT MR. CRAWFORD'S AFFECTION FOR HER COULD DISTRESS HIM
LONG; HIS MIND WAS NOT OF THAT SORT. LONDON WOULD SOON BRING ITS CURE.
IN LONDON HE WOULD SOON LEARN TO WONDER AT HIS INFATUATION, AND BE
THANKFUL FOR THE RIGHT REASON IN HER WHICH HAD SAVED HIM FROM ITS EVIL
CONSEQUENCES.

WHILE FANNY'S MIND WAS ENGAGED IN THESE SORT OF HOPES, HER UNCLE WAS,
SOON AFTER TEA, CALLED OUT OF THE ROOM; AN OCCURRENCE TOO COMMON TO
STRIKE HER, AND SHE THOUGHT NOTHING OF IT TILL THE BUTLER REAPPEARED TEN
MINUTES AFTERWARDS, AND ADVANCING DECIDEDLY TOWARDS HERSELF, SAID,
"SIR THOMAS WISHES TO SPEAK WITH YOU, MA'AM, IN HIS OWN ROOM." THEN IT
OCCURRED TO HER WHAT MIGHT BE GOING ON; A SUSPICION RUSHED OVER HER MIND
WHICH DROVE THE COLOUR FROM HER CHEEKS; BUT INSTANTLY RISING, SHE WAS
PREPARING TO OBEY, WHEN MRS. NORRIS CALLED OUT, "STAY, STAY, FANNY! WHAT
ARE YOU ABOUT? WHERE ARE YOU GOING? DON'T BE IN SUCH A HURRY. DEPEND
UPON IT, IT IS NOT YOU WHO ARE WANTED; DEPEND UPON IT, IT IS ME"
(LOOKING AT THE BUTLER); "BUT YOU ARE SO VERY EAGER TO PUT YOURSELF
FORWARD. WHAT SHOULD SIR THOMAS WANT YOU FOR? IT IS ME, BADDELEY, YOU
MEAN; I AM COMING THIS MOMENT. YOU MEAN ME, BADDELEY, I AM SURE; SIR
THOMAS WANTS ME, NOT MISS PRICE."

BUT BADDELEY WAS STOUT. "NO, MA'AM, IT IS MISS PRICE; I AM CERTAIN OF
ITS BEING MISS PRICE." AND THERE WAS A HALF-SMILE WITH THE WORDS, WHICH
MEANT, "I DO NOT THINK YOU WOULD ANSWER THE PURPOSE AT ALL."

MRS. NORRIS, MUCH DISCONTENTED, WAS OBLIGED TO COMPOSE HERSELF TO WORK
AGAIN; AND FANNY, WALKING OFF IN AGITATING CONSCIOUSNESS, FOUND HERSELF,
AS SHE ANTICIPATED, IN ANOTHER MINUTE ALONE WITH MR. CRAWFORD.



CHAPTER XXXIII

THE CONFERENCE WAS NEITHER SO SHORT NOR SO CONCLUSIVE AS THE LADY HAD
DESIGNED. THE GENTLEMAN WAS NOT SO EASILY SATISFIED. HE HAD ALL THE
DISPOSITION TO PERSEVERE THAT SIR THOMAS COULD WISH HIM. HE HAD VANITY,
WHICH STRONGLY INCLINED HIM IN THE FIRST PLACE TO THINK SHE DID LOVE
HIM, THOUGH SHE MIGHT NOT KNOW IT HERSELF; AND WHICH, SECONDLY, WHEN
CONSTRAINED AT LAST TO ADMIT THAT SHE DID KNOW HER OWN PRESENT FEELINGS,
CONVINCED HIM THAT HE SHOULD BE ABLE IN TIME TO MAKE THOSE FEELINGS WHAT
HE WISHED.

HE WAS IN LOVE, VERY MUCH IN LOVE; AND IT WAS A LOVE WHICH, OPERATING
ON AN ACTIVE, SANGUINE SPIRIT, OF MORE WARMTH THAN DELICACY, MADE HER
AFFECTION APPEAR OF GREATER CONSEQUENCE BECAUSE IT WAS WITHHELD, AND
DETERMINED HIM TO HAVE THE GLORY, AS WELL AS THE FELICITY, OF FORCING
HER TO LOVE HIM.

HE WOULD NOT DESPAIR: HE WOULD NOT DESIST. HE HAD EVERY WELL-GROUNDED
REASON FOR SOLID ATTACHMENT; HE KNEW HER TO HAVE ALL THE WORTH THAT
COULD JUSTIFY THE WARMEST HOPES OF LASTING HAPPINESS WITH HER; HER
CONDUCT AT THIS VERY TIME, BY SPEAKING THE DISINTERESTEDNESS AND
DELICACY OF HER CHARACTER (QUALITIES WHICH HE BELIEVED MOST RARE
INDEED), WAS OF A SORT TO HEIGHTEN ALL HIS WISHES, AND CONFIRM ALL HIS
RESOLUTIONS. HE KNEW NOT THAT HE HAD A PRE-ENGAGED HEART TO ATTACK.
OF THAT HE HAD NO SUSPICION. HE CONSIDERED HER RATHER AS ONE WHO
HAD NEVER THOUGHT ON THE SUBJECT ENOUGH TO BE IN DANGER; WHO HAD BEEN
GUARDED BY YOUTH, A YOUTH OF MIND AS LOVELY AS OF PERSON; WHOSE MODESTY
HAD PREVENTED HER FROM UNDERSTANDING HIS ATTENTIONS, AND WHO WAS STILL
OVERPOWERED BY THE SUDDENNESS OF ADDRESSES SO WHOLLY UNEXPECTED, AND THE
NOVELTY OF A SITUATION WHICH HER FANCY HAD NEVER TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT.

MUST IT NOT FOLLOW OF COURSE, THAT, WHEN HE WAS UNDERSTOOD, HE SHOULD
SUCCEED? HE BELIEVED IT FULLY. LOVE SUCH AS HIS, IN A MAN LIKE HIMSELF,
MUST WITH PERSEVERANCE SECURE A RETURN, AND AT NO GREAT DISTANCE; AND
HE HAD SO MUCH DELIGHT IN THE IDEA OF OBLIGING HER TO LOVE HIM IN A VERY
SHORT TIME, THAT HER NOT LOVING HIM NOW WAS SCARCELY REGRETTED. A LITTLE
DIFFICULTY TO BE OVERCOME WAS NO EVIL TO HENRY CRAWFORD. HE RATHER
DERIVED SPIRITS FROM IT. HE HAD BEEN APT TO GAIN HEARTS TOO EASILY. HIS
SITUATION WAS NEW AND ANIMATING.

TO FANNY, HOWEVER, WHO HAD KNOWN TOO MUCH OPPOSITION ALL HER LIFE TO
FIND ANY CHARM IN IT, ALL THIS WAS UNINTELLIGIBLE. SHE FOUND THAT HE DID
MEAN TO PERSEVERE; BUT HOW HE COULD, AFTER SUCH LANGUAGE FROM HER AS SHE
FELT HERSELF OBLIGED TO USE, WAS NOT TO BE UNDERSTOOD. SHE TOLD HIM THAT
SHE DID NOT LOVE HIM, COULD NOT LOVE HIM, WAS SURE SHE NEVER SHOULD LOVE
HIM; THAT SUCH A CHANGE WAS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE; THAT THE SUBJECT WAS MOST
PAINFUL TO HER; THAT SHE MUST ENTREAT HIM NEVER TO MENTION IT AGAIN, TO
ALLOW HER TO LEAVE HIM AT ONCE, AND LET IT BE CONSIDERED AS CONCLUDED
FOR EVER. AND WHEN FARTHER PRESSED, HAD ADDED, THAT IN HER OPINION THEIR
DISPOSITIONS WERE SO TOTALLY DISSIMILAR AS TO MAKE MUTUAL AFFECTION
INCOMPATIBLE; AND THAT THEY WERE UNFITTED FOR EACH OTHER BY NATURE,
EDUCATION, AND HABIT. ALL THIS SHE HAD SAID, AND WITH THE EARNESTNESS
OF SINCERITY; YET THIS WAS NOT ENOUGH, FOR HE IMMEDIATELY DENIED THERE
BEING ANYTHING UNCONGENIAL IN THEIR CHARACTERS, OR ANYTHING UNFRIENDLY
IN THEIR SITUATIONS; AND POSITIVELY DECLARED, THAT HE WOULD STILL LOVE,
AND STILL HOPE!

FANNY KNEW HER OWN MEANING, BUT WAS NO JUDGE OF HER OWN MANNER. HER
MANNER WAS INCURABLY GENTLE; AND SHE WAS NOT AWARE HOW MUCH IT CONCEALED
THE STERNNESS OF HER PURPOSE. HER DIFFIDENCE, GRATITUDE, AND SOFTNESS
MADE EVERY EXPRESSION OF INDIFFERENCE SEEM ALMOST AN EFFORT OF
SELF-DENIAL; SEEM, AT LEAST, TO BE GIVING NEARLY AS MUCH PAIN TO HERSELF
AS TO HIM. MR. CRAWFORD WAS NO LONGER THE MR. CRAWFORD WHO, AS THE
CLANDESTINE, INSIDIOUS, TREACHEROUS ADMIRER OF MARIA BERTRAM, HAD BEEN
HER ABHORRENCE, WHOM SHE HAD HATED TO SEE OR TO SPEAK TO, IN WHOM SHE
COULD BELIEVE NO GOOD QUALITY TO EXIST, AND WHOSE POWER, EVEN OF BEING
AGREEABLE, SHE HAD BARELY ACKNOWLEDGED. HE WAS NOW THE MR. CRAWFORD WHO
WAS ADDRESSING HERSELF WITH ARDENT, DISINTERESTED LOVE; WHOSE FEELINGS
WERE APPARENTLY BECOME ALL THAT WAS HONOURABLE AND UPRIGHT, WHOSE VIEWS
OF HAPPINESS WERE ALL FIXED ON A MARRIAGE OF ATTACHMENT; WHO WAS
POURING OUT HIS SENSE OF HER MERITS, DESCRIBING AND DESCRIBING AGAIN HIS
AFFECTION, PROVING AS FAR AS WORDS COULD PROVE IT, AND IN THE LANGUAGE,
TONE, AND SPIRIT OF A MAN OF TALENT TOO, THAT HE SOUGHT HER FOR HER
GENTLENESS AND HER GOODNESS; AND TO COMPLETE THE WHOLE, HE WAS NOW THE
MR. CRAWFORD WHO HAD PROCURED WILLIAM'S PROMOTION!

HERE WAS A CHANGE, AND HERE WERE CLAIMS WHICH COULD NOT BUT OPERATE!
SHE MIGHT HAVE DISDAINED HIM IN ALL THE DIGNITY OF ANGRY VIRTUE, IN
THE GROUNDS OF SOTHERTON, OR THE THEATRE AT MANSFIELD PARK; BUT HE
APPROACHED HER NOW WITH RIGHTS THAT DEMANDED DIFFERENT TREATMENT.
SHE MUST BE COURTEOUS, AND SHE MUST BE COMPASSIONATE. SHE MUST HAVE
A SENSATION OF BEING HONOURED, AND WHETHER THINKING OF HERSELF OR HER
BROTHER, SHE MUST HAVE A STRONG FEELING OF GRATITUDE. THE EFFECT OF THE
WHOLE WAS A MANNER SO PITYING AND AGITATED, AND WORDS INTERMINGLED WITH
HER REFUSAL SO EXPRESSIVE OF OBLIGATION AND CONCERN, THAT TO A TEMPER OF
VANITY AND HOPE LIKE CRAWFORD'S, THE TRUTH, OR AT LEAST THE STRENGTH
OF HER INDIFFERENCE, MIGHT WELL BE QUESTIONABLE; AND HE WAS NOT SO
IRRATIONAL AS FANNY CONSIDERED HIM, IN THE PROFESSIONS OF PERSEVERING,
ASSIDUOUS, AND NOT DESPONDING ATTACHMENT WHICH CLOSED THE INTERVIEW.

IT WAS WITH RELUCTANCE THAT HE SUFFERED HER TO GO; BUT THERE WAS NO LOOK
OF DESPAIR IN PARTING TO BELIE HIS WORDS, OR GIVE HER HOPES OF HIS BEING
LESS UNREASONABLE THAN HE PROFESSED HIMSELF.

NOW SHE WAS ANGRY. SOME RESENTMENT DID ARISE AT A PERSEVERANCE SO
SELFISH AND UNGENEROUS. HERE WAS AGAIN A WANT OF DELICACY AND REGARD FOR
OTHERS WHICH HAD FORMERLY SO STRUCK AND DISGUSTED HER. HERE WAS AGAIN
A SOMETHING OF THE SAME MR. CRAWFORD WHOM SHE HAD SO REPROBATED BEFORE.
HOW EVIDENTLY WAS THERE A GROSS WANT OF FEELING AND HUMANITY WHERE HIS
OWN PLEASURE WAS CONCERNED; AND ALAS! HOW ALWAYS KNOWN NO PRINCIPLE TO
SUPPLY AS A DUTY WHAT THE HEART WAS DEFICIENT IN! HAD HER OWN AFFECTIONS
BEEN AS FREE AS PERHAPS THEY OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN, HE NEVER COULD HAVE
ENGAGED THEM.

SO THOUGHT FANNY, IN GOOD TRUTH AND SOBER SADNESS, AS SHE SAT MUSING
OVER THAT TOO GREAT INDULGENCE AND LUXURY OF A FIRE UPSTAIRS: WONDERING
AT THE PAST AND PRESENT; WONDERING AT WHAT WAS YET TO COME, AND IN A
NERVOUS AGITATION WHICH MADE NOTHING CLEAR TO HER BUT THE PERSUASION OF
HER BEING NEVER UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES ABLE TO LOVE MR. CRAWFORD, AND
THE FELICITY OF HAVING A FIRE TO SIT OVER AND THINK OF IT.

SIR THOMAS WAS OBLIGED, OR OBLIGED HIMSELF, TO WAIT TILL THE MORROW FOR
A KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT HAD PASSED BETWEEN THE YOUNG PEOPLE. HE THEN SAW
MR. CRAWFORD, AND RECEIVED HIS ACCOUNT. THE FIRST FEELING WAS
DISAPPOINTMENT: HE HAD HOPED BETTER THINGS; HE HAD THOUGHT THAT AN
HOUR'S ENTREATY FROM A YOUNG MAN LIKE CRAWFORD COULD NOT HAVE WORKED SO
LITTLE CHANGE ON A GENTLE-TEMPERED GIRL LIKE FANNY; BUT THERE WAS SPEEDY
COMFORT IN THE DETERMINED VIEWS AND SANGUINE PERSEVERANCE OF THE LOVER;
AND WHEN SEEING SUCH CONFIDENCE OF SUCCESS IN THE PRINCIPAL, SIR THOMAS
WAS SOON ABLE TO DEPEND ON IT HIMSELF.

NOTHING WAS OMITTED, ON HIS SIDE, OF CIVILITY, COMPLIMENT, OR KINDNESS,
THAT MIGHT ASSIST THE PLAN. MR. CRAWFORD'S STEADINESS WAS HONOURED, AND
FANNY WAS PRAISED, AND THE CONNEXION WAS STILL THE MOST DESIRABLE IN THE
WORLD. AT MANSFIELD PARK MR. CRAWFORD WOULD ALWAYS BE WELCOME; HE HAD
ONLY TO CONSULT HIS OWN JUDGMENT AND FEELINGS AS TO THE FREQUENCY OF HIS
VISITS, AT PRESENT OR IN FUTURE. IN ALL HIS NIECE'S FAMILY AND FRIENDS,
THERE COULD BE BUT ONE OPINION, ONE WISH ON THE SUBJECT; THE INFLUENCE
OF ALL WHO LOVED HER MUST INCLINE ONE WAY.

EVERYTHING WAS SAID THAT COULD ENCOURAGE, EVERY ENCOURAGEMENT RECEIVED
WITH GRATEFUL JOY, AND THE GENTLEMEN PARTED THE BEST OF FRIENDS.

SATISFIED THAT THE CAUSE WAS NOW ON A FOOTING THE MOST PROPER AND
HOPEFUL, SIR THOMAS RESOLVED TO ABSTAIN FROM ALL FARTHER IMPORTUNITY
WITH HIS NIECE, AND TO SHEW NO OPEN INTERFERENCE. UPON HER DISPOSITION
HE BELIEVED KINDNESS MIGHT BE THE BEST WAY OF WORKING. ENTREATY SHOULD
BE FROM ONE QUARTER ONLY. THE FORBEARANCE OF HER FAMILY ON A POINT,
RESPECTING WHICH SHE COULD BE IN NO DOUBT OF THEIR WISHES, MIGHT BE
THEIR SUREST MEANS OF FORWARDING IT. ACCORDINGLY, ON THIS PRINCIPLE, SIR
THOMAS TOOK THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY OF SAYING TO HER, WITH A MILD GRAVITY,
INTENDED TO BE OVERCOMING, "WELL, FANNY, I HAVE SEEN MR. CRAWFORD AGAIN,
AND LEARN FROM HIM EXACTLY HOW MATTERS STAND BETWEEN YOU. HE IS A MOST
EXTRAORDINARY YOUNG MAN, AND WHATEVER BE THE EVENT, YOU MUST FEEL THAT
YOU HAVE CREATED AN ATTACHMENT OF NO COMMON CHARACTER; THOUGH, YOUNG
AS YOU ARE, AND LITTLE ACQUAINTED WITH THE TRANSIENT, VARYING, UNSTEADY
NATURE OF LOVE, AS IT GENERALLY EXISTS, YOU CANNOT BE STRUCK AS I
AM WITH ALL THAT IS WONDERFUL IN A PERSEVERANCE OF THIS SORT AGAINST
DISCOURAGEMENT. WITH HIM IT IS ENTIRELY A MATTER OF FEELING: HE CLAIMS
NO MERIT IN IT; PERHAPS IS ENTITLED TO NONE. YET, HAVING CHOSEN SO
WELL, HIS CONSTANCY HAS A RESPECTABLE STAMP. HAD HIS CHOICE BEEN LESS
UNEXCEPTIONABLE, I SHOULD HAVE CONDEMNED HIS PERSEVERING."

"INDEED, SIR," SAID FANNY, "I AM VERY SORRY THAT MR. CRAWFORD SHOULD
CONTINUE TO KNOW THAT IT IS PAYING ME A VERY GREAT COMPLIMENT, AND I
FEEL MOST UNDESERVEDLY HONOURED; BUT I AM SO PERFECTLY CONVINCED, AND I
HAVE TOLD HIM SO, THAT IT NEVER WILL BE IN MY POWER--"

"MY DEAR," INTERRUPTED SIR THOMAS, "THERE IS NO OCCASION FOR THIS. YOUR
FEELINGS ARE AS WELL KNOWN TO ME AS MY WISHES AND REGRETS MUST BE
TO YOU. THERE IS NOTHING MORE TO BE SAID OR DONE. FROM THIS HOUR THE
SUBJECT IS NEVER TO BE REVIVED BETWEEN US. YOU WILL HAVE NOTHING TO
FEAR, OR TO BE AGITATED ABOUT. YOU CANNOT SUPPOSE ME CAPABLE OF TRYING
TO PERSUADE YOU TO MARRY AGAINST YOUR INCLINATIONS. YOUR HAPPINESS AND
ADVANTAGE ARE ALL THAT I HAVE IN VIEW, AND NOTHING IS REQUIRED OF YOU
BUT TO BEAR WITH MR. CRAWFORD'S ENDEAVOURS TO CONVINCE YOU THAT THEY MAY
NOT BE INCOMPATIBLE WITH HIS. HE PROCEEDS AT HIS OWN RISK. YOU ARE ON
SAFE GROUND. I HAVE ENGAGED FOR YOUR SEEING HIM WHENEVER HE CALLS, AS
YOU MIGHT HAVE DONE HAD NOTHING OF THIS SORT OCCURRED. YOU WILL SEE
HIM WITH THE REST OF US, IN THE SAME MANNER, AND, AS MUCH AS YOU
CAN, DISMISSING THE RECOLLECTION OF EVERYTHING UNPLEASANT. HE LEAVES
NORTHAMPTONSHIRE SO SOON, THAT EVEN THIS SLIGHT SACRIFICE CANNOT BE
OFTEN DEMANDED. THE FUTURE MUST BE VERY UNCERTAIN. AND NOW, MY DEAR
FANNY, THIS SUBJECT IS CLOSED BETWEEN US."

THE PROMISED DEPARTURE WAS ALL THAT FANNY COULD THINK OF WITH MUCH
SATISFACTION. HER UNCLE'S KIND EXPRESSIONS, HOWEVER, AND FORBEARING
MANNER, WERE SENSIBLY FELT; AND WHEN SHE CONSIDERED HOW MUCH OF THE
TRUTH WAS UNKNOWN TO HIM, SHE BELIEVED SHE HAD NO RIGHT TO WONDER AT
THE LINE OF CONDUCT HE PURSUED. HE, WHO HAD MARRIED A DAUGHTER TO MR.
RUSHWORTH: ROMANTIC DELICACY WAS CERTAINLY NOT TO BE EXPECTED FROM HIM.
SHE MUST DO HER DUTY, AND TRUST THAT TIME MIGHT MAKE HER DUTY EASIER
THAN IT NOW WAS.

SHE COULD NOT, THOUGH ONLY EIGHTEEN, SUPPOSE MR. CRAWFORD'S ATTACHMENT
WOULD HOLD OUT FOR EVER; SHE COULD NOT BUT IMAGINE THAT STEADY,
UNCEASING DISCOURAGEMENT FROM HERSELF WOULD PUT AN END TO IT IN TIME.
HOW MUCH TIME SHE MIGHT, IN HER OWN FANCY, ALLOT FOR ITS DOMINION, IS
ANOTHER CONCERN. IT WOULD NOT BE FAIR TO INQUIRE INTO A YOUNG LADY'S
EXACT ESTIMATE OF HER OWN PERFECTIONS.

IN SPITE OF HIS INTENDED SILENCE, SIR THOMAS FOUND HIMSELF ONCE MORE
OBLIGED TO MENTION THE SUBJECT TO HIS NIECE, TO PREPARE HER BRIEFLY FOR
ITS BEING IMPARTED TO HER AUNTS; A MEASURE WHICH HE WOULD STILL HAVE
AVOIDED, IF POSSIBLE, BUT WHICH BECAME NECESSARY FROM THE TOTALLY
OPPOSITE FEELINGS OF MR. CRAWFORD AS TO ANY SECRECY OF PROCEEDING. HE
HAD NO IDEA OF CONCEALMENT. IT WAS ALL KNOWN AT THE PARSONAGE, WHERE
HE LOVED TO TALK OVER THE FUTURE WITH BOTH HIS SISTERS, AND IT WOULD BE
RATHER GRATIFYING TO HIM TO HAVE ENLIGHTENED WITNESSES OF THE PROGRESS
OF HIS SUCCESS. WHEN SIR THOMAS UNDERSTOOD THIS, HE FELT THE NECESSITY
OF MAKING HIS OWN WIFE AND SISTER-IN-LAW ACQUAINTED WITH THE BUSINESS
WITHOUT DELAY; THOUGH, ON FANNY'S ACCOUNT, HE ALMOST DREADED THE
EFFECT OF THE COMMUNICATION TO MRS. NORRIS AS MUCH AS FANNY HERSELF. HE
DEPRECATED HER MISTAKEN BUT WELL-MEANING ZEAL. SIR THOMAS, INDEED, WAS,
BY THIS TIME, NOT VERY FAR FROM CLASSING MRS. NORRIS AS ONE OF THOSE
WELL-MEANING PEOPLE WHO ARE ALWAYS DOING MISTAKEN AND VERY DISAGREEABLE
THINGS.

MRS. NORRIS, HOWEVER, RELIEVED HIM. HE PRESSED FOR THE STRICTEST
FORBEARANCE AND SILENCE TOWARDS THEIR NIECE; SHE NOT ONLY PROMISED, BUT
DID OBSERVE IT. SHE ONLY LOOKED HER INCREASED ILL-WILL. ANGRY SHE WAS:
BITTERLY ANGRY; BUT SHE WAS MORE ANGRY WITH FANNY FOR HAVING RECEIVED
SUCH AN OFFER THAN FOR REFUSING IT. IT WAS AN INJURY AND AFFRONT TO
JULIA, WHO OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN MR. CRAWFORD'S CHOICE; AND, INDEPENDENTLY
OF THAT, SHE DISLIKED FANNY, BECAUSE SHE HAD NEGLECTED HER; AND SHE
WOULD HAVE GRUDGED SUCH AN ELEVATION TO ONE WHOM SHE HAD BEEN ALWAYS
TRYING TO DEPRESS.

SIR THOMAS GAVE HER MORE CREDIT FOR DISCRETION ON THE OCCASION THAN SHE
DESERVED; AND FANNY COULD HAVE BLESSED HER FOR ALLOWING HER ONLY TO SEE
HER DISPLEASURE, AND NOT TO HEAR IT.

LADY BERTRAM TOOK IT DIFFERENTLY. SHE HAD BEEN A BEAUTY, AND A
PROSPEROUS BEAUTY, ALL HER LIFE; AND BEAUTY AND WEALTH WERE ALL THAT
EXCITED HER RESPECT. TO KNOW FANNY TO BE SOUGHT IN MARRIAGE BY A MAN OF
FORTUNE, RAISED HER, THEREFORE, VERY MUCH IN HER OPINION. BY CONVINCING
HER THAT FANNY WAS VERY PRETTY, WHICH SHE HAD BEEN DOUBTING ABOUT
BEFORE, AND THAT SHE WOULD BE ADVANTAGEOUSLY MARRIED, IT MADE HER FEEL A
SORT OF CREDIT IN CALLING HER NIECE.

"WELL, FANNY," SAID SHE, AS SOON AS THEY WERE ALONE TOGETHER AFTERWARDS,
AND SHE REALLY HAD KNOWN SOMETHING LIKE IMPATIENCE TO BE ALONE WITH HER,
AND HER COUNTENANCE, AS SHE SPOKE, HAD EXTRAORDINARY ANIMATION; "WELL,
FANNY, I HAVE HAD A VERY AGREEABLE SURPRISE THIS MORNING. I MUST JUST
SPEAK OF IT ONCE, I TOLD SIR THOMAS I MUST ONCE, AND THEN I
SHALL HAVE DONE. I GIVE YOU JOY, MY DEAR NIECE." AND LOOKING AT HER
COMPLACENTLY, SHE ADDED, "HUMPH, WE CERTAINLY ARE A HANDSOME FAMILY!"

FANNY COLOURED, AND DOUBTED AT FIRST WHAT TO SAY; WHEN, HOPING TO ASSAIL
HER ON HER VULNERABLE SIDE, SHE PRESENTLY ANSWERED--

"MY DEAR AUNT, YOU CANNOT WISH ME TO DO DIFFERENTLY FROM WHAT I HAVE
DONE, I AM SURE. YOU CANNOT WISH ME TO MARRY; FOR YOU WOULD MISS ME,
SHOULD NOT YOU? YES, I AM SURE YOU WOULD MISS ME TOO MUCH FOR THAT."

"NO, MY DEAR, I SHOULD NOT THINK OF MISSING YOU, WHEN SUCH AN OFFER AS
THIS COMES IN YOUR WAY. I COULD DO VERY WELL WITHOUT YOU, IF YOU WERE
MARRIED TO A MAN OF SUCH GOOD ESTATE AS MR. CRAWFORD. AND YOU MUST BE
AWARE, FANNY, THAT IT IS EVERY YOUNG WOMAN'S DUTY TO ACCEPT SUCH A VERY
UNEXCEPTIONABLE OFFER AS THIS."

THIS WAS ALMOST THE ONLY RULE OF CONDUCT, THE ONLY PIECE OF ADVICE,
WHICH FANNY HAD EVER RECEIVED FROM HER AUNT IN THE COURSE OF EIGHT YEARS
AND A HALF. IT SILENCED HER. SHE FELT HOW UNPROFITABLE CONTENTION WOULD
BE. IF HER AUNT'S FEELINGS WERE AGAINST HER, NOTHING COULD BE HOPED FROM
ATTACKING HER UNDERSTANDING. LADY BERTRAM WAS QUITE TALKATIVE.

"I WILL TELL YOU WHAT, FANNY," SAID SHE, "I AM SURE HE FELL IN LOVE WITH
YOU AT THE BALL; I AM SURE THE MISCHIEF WAS DONE THAT EVENING. YOU DID
LOOK REMARKABLY WELL. EVERYBODY SAID SO. SIR THOMAS SAID SO. AND YOU
KNOW YOU HAD CHAPMAN TO HELP YOU TO DRESS. I AM VERY GLAD I SENT
CHAPMAN TO YOU. I SHALL TELL SIR THOMAS THAT I AM SURE IT WAS DONE
THAT EVENING." AND STILL PURSUING THE SAME CHEERFUL THOUGHTS, SHE SOON
AFTERWARDS ADDED, "AND WILL TELL YOU WHAT, FANNY, WHICH IS MORE THAN I
DID FOR MARIA: THE NEXT TIME PUG HAS A LITTER YOU SHALL HAVE A PUPPY."



CHAPTER XXXIV

EDMUND HAD GREAT THINGS TO HEAR ON HIS RETURN. MANY SURPRISES WERE
AWAITING HIM. THE FIRST THAT OCCURRED WAS NOT LEAST IN INTEREST: THE
APPEARANCE OF HENRY CRAWFORD AND HIS SISTER WALKING TOGETHER THROUGH THE
VILLAGE AS HE RODE INTO IT. HE HAD CONCLUDED--HE HAD MEANT THEM TO BE
FAR DISTANT. HIS ABSENCE HAD BEEN EXTENDED BEYOND A FORTNIGHT PURPOSELY
TO AVOID MISS CRAWFORD. HE WAS RETURNING TO MANSFIELD WITH SPIRITS READY
TO FEED ON MELANCHOLY REMEMBRANCES, AND TENDER ASSOCIATIONS, WHEN HER
OWN FAIR SELF WAS BEFORE HIM, LEANING ON HER BROTHER'S ARM, AND HE FOUND
HIMSELF RECEIVING A WELCOME, UNQUESTIONABLY FRIENDLY, FROM THE WOMAN
WHOM, TWO MOMENTS BEFORE, HE HAD BEEN THINKING OF AS SEVENTY MILES OFF,
AND AS FARTHER, MUCH FARTHER, FROM HIM IN INCLINATION THAN ANY DISTANCE
COULD EXPRESS.

HER RECEPTION OF HIM WAS OF A SORT WHICH HE COULD NOT HAVE HOPED
FOR, HAD HE EXPECTED TO SEE HER. COMING AS HE DID FROM SUCH A PURPORT
FULFILLED AS HAD TAKEN HIM AWAY, HE WOULD HAVE EXPECTED ANYTHING RATHER
THAN A LOOK OF SATISFACTION, AND WORDS OF SIMPLE, PLEASANT MEANING.
IT WAS ENOUGH TO SET HIS HEART IN A GLOW, AND TO BRING HIM HOME IN THE
PROPEREST STATE FOR FEELING THE FULL VALUE OF THE OTHER JOYFUL SURPRISES
AT HAND.

WILLIAM'S PROMOTION, WITH ALL ITS PARTICULARS, HE WAS SOON MASTER OF;
AND WITH SUCH A SECRET PROVISION OF COMFORT WITHIN HIS OWN BREAST TO
HELP THE JOY, HE FOUND IN IT A SOURCE OF MOST GRATIFYING SENSATION AND
UNVARYING CHEERFULNESS ALL DINNER-TIME.

AFTER DINNER, WHEN HE AND HIS FATHER WERE ALONE, HE HAD FANNY'S HISTORY;
AND THEN ALL THE GREAT EVENTS OF THE LAST FORTNIGHT, AND THE PRESENT
SITUATION OF MATTERS AT MANSFIELD WERE KNOWN TO HIM.

FANNY SUSPECTED WHAT WAS GOING ON. THEY SAT SO MUCH LONGER THAN USUAL IN
THE DINING-PARLOUR, THAT SHE WAS SURE THEY MUST BE TALKING OF HER; AND
WHEN TEA AT LAST BROUGHT THEM AWAY, AND SHE WAS TO BE SEEN BY EDMUND
AGAIN, SHE FELT DREADFULLY GUILTY. HE CAME TO HER, SAT DOWN BY HER, TOOK
HER HAND, AND PRESSED IT KINDLY; AND AT THAT MOMENT SHE THOUGHT THAT,
BUT FOR THE OCCUPATION AND THE SCENE WHICH THE TEA-THINGS AFFORDED, SHE
MUST HAVE BETRAYED HER EMOTION IN SOME UNPARDONABLE EXCESS.

HE WAS NOT INTENDING, HOWEVER, BY SUCH ACTION, TO BE CONVEYING TO HER
THAT UNQUALIFIED APPROBATION AND ENCOURAGEMENT WHICH HER HOPES DREW
FROM IT. IT WAS DESIGNED ONLY TO EXPRESS HIS PARTICIPATION IN ALL THAT
INTERESTED HER, AND TO TELL HER THAT HE HAD BEEN HEARING WHAT QUICKENED
EVERY FEELING OF AFFECTION. HE WAS, IN FACT, ENTIRELY ON HIS FATHER'S
SIDE OF THE QUESTION. HIS SURPRISE WAS NOT SO GREAT AS HIS FATHER'S AT
HER REFUSING CRAWFORD, BECAUSE, SO FAR FROM SUPPOSING HER TO CONSIDER
HIM WITH ANYTHING LIKE A PREFERENCE, HE HAD ALWAYS BELIEVED IT TO
BE RATHER THE REVERSE, AND COULD IMAGINE HER TO BE TAKEN PERFECTLY
UNPREPARED, BUT SIR THOMAS COULD NOT REGARD THE CONNEXION AS MORE
DESIRABLE THAN HE DID. IT HAD EVERY RECOMMENDATION TO HIM; AND WHILE
HONOURING HER FOR WHAT SHE HAD DONE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF HER PRESENT
INDIFFERENCE, HONOURING HER IN RATHER STRONGER TERMS THAN SIR THOMAS
COULD QUITE ECHO, HE WAS MOST EARNEST IN HOPING, AND SANGUINE IN
BELIEVING, THAT IT WOULD BE A MATCH AT LAST, AND THAT, UNITED BY MUTUAL
AFFECTION, IT WOULD APPEAR THAT THEIR DISPOSITIONS WERE AS EXACTLY
FITTED TO MAKE THEM BLESSED IN EACH OTHER, AS HE WAS NOW BEGINNING
SERIOUSLY TO CONSIDER THEM. CRAWFORD HAD BEEN TOO PRECIPITATE. HE HAD
NOT GIVEN HER TIME TO ATTACH HERSELF. HE HAD BEGUN AT THE WRONG END.
WITH SUCH POWERS AS HIS, HOWEVER, AND SUCH A DISPOSITION AS HERS, EDMUND
TRUSTED THAT EVERYTHING WOULD WORK OUT A HAPPY CONCLUSION. MEANWHILE,
HE SAW ENOUGH OF FANNY'S EMBARRASSMENT TO MAKE HIM SCRUPULOUSLY GUARD
AGAINST EXCITING IT A SECOND TIME, BY ANY WORD, OR LOOK, OR MOVEMENT.

CRAWFORD CALLED THE NEXT DAY, AND ON THE SCORE OF EDMUND'S RETURN, SIR
THOMAS FELT HIMSELF MORE THAN LICENSED TO ASK HIM TO STAY DINNER; IT WAS
REALLY A NECESSARY COMPLIMENT. HE STAID OF COURSE, AND EDMUND HAD THEN
AMPLE OPPORTUNITY FOR OBSERVING HOW HE SPED WITH FANNY, AND WHAT DEGREE
OF IMMEDIATE ENCOURAGEMENT FOR HIM MIGHT BE EXTRACTED FROM HER MANNERS;
AND IT WAS SO LITTLE, SO VERY, VERY LITTLE--EVERY CHANCE, EVERY
POSSIBILITY OF IT, RESTING UPON HER EMBARRASSMENT ONLY; IF THERE WAS
NOT HOPE IN HER CONFUSION, THERE WAS HOPE IN NOTHING ELSE--THAT HE WAS
ALMOST READY TO WONDER AT HIS FRIEND'S PERSEVERANCE. FANNY WAS WORTH IT
ALL; HE HELD HER TO BE WORTH EVERY EFFORT OF PATIENCE, EVERY EXERTION OF
MIND, BUT HE DID NOT THINK HE COULD HAVE GONE ON HIMSELF WITH ANY WOMAN
BREATHING, WITHOUT SOMETHING MORE TO WARM HIS COURAGE THAN HIS EYES
COULD DISCERN IN HERS. HE WAS VERY WILLING TO HOPE THAT CRAWFORD SAW
CLEARER, AND THIS WAS THE MOST COMFORTABLE CONCLUSION FOR HIS FRIEND
THAT HE COULD COME TO FROM ALL THAT HE OBSERVED TO PASS BEFORE, AND AT,
AND AFTER DINNER.

IN THE EVENING A FEW CIRCUMSTANCES OCCURRED WHICH HE THOUGHT MORE
PROMISING. WHEN HE AND CRAWFORD WALKED INTO THE DRAWING-ROOM, HIS MOTHER
AND FANNY WERE SITTING AS INTENTLY AND SILENTLY AT WORK AS IF THERE
WERE NOTHING ELSE TO CARE FOR. EDMUND COULD NOT HELP NOTICING THEIR
APPARENTLY DEEP TRANQUILLITY.

"WE HAVE NOT BEEN SO SILENT ALL THE TIME," REPLIED HIS MOTHER. "FANNY
HAS BEEN READING TO ME, AND ONLY PUT THE BOOK DOWN UPON HEARING YOU
COMING." AND SURE ENOUGH THERE WAS A BOOK ON THE TABLE WHICH HAD THE AIR
OF BEING VERY RECENTLY CLOSED: A VOLUME OF SHAKESPEARE. "SHE OFTEN
READS TO ME OUT OF THOSE BOOKS; AND SHE WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF A VERY
FINE SPEECH OF THAT MAN'S--WHAT'S HIS NAME, FANNY?--WHEN WE HEARD YOUR
FOOTSTEPS."

CRAWFORD TOOK THE VOLUME. "LET ME HAVE THE PLEASURE OF FINISHING THAT
SPEECH TO YOUR LADYSHIP," SAID HE. "I SHALL FIND IT IMMEDIATELY." AND BY
CAREFULLY GIVING WAY TO THE INCLINATION OF THE LEAVES, HE DID FIND IT,
OR WITHIN A PAGE OR TWO, QUITE NEAR ENOUGH TO SATISFY LADY BERTRAM, WHO
ASSURED HIM, AS SOON AS HE MENTIONED THE NAME OF CARDINAL WOLSEY, THAT
HE HAD GOT THE VERY SPEECH. NOT A LOOK OR AN OFFER OF HELP HAD FANNY
GIVEN; NOT A SYLLABLE FOR OR AGAINST. ALL HER ATTENTION WAS FOR HER
WORK. SHE SEEMED DETERMINED TO BE INTERESTED BY NOTHING ELSE. BUT TASTE
WAS TOO STRONG IN HER. SHE COULD NOT ABSTRACT HER MIND FIVE MINUTES: SHE
WAS FORCED TO LISTEN; HIS READING WAS CAPITAL, AND HER PLEASURE IN GOOD
READING EXTREME. TO GOOD READING, HOWEVER, SHE HAD BEEN LONG USED:
HER UNCLE READ WELL, HER COUSINS ALL, EDMUND VERY WELL, BUT IN MR.
CRAWFORD'S READING THERE WAS A VARIETY OF EXCELLENCE BEYOND WHAT SHE HAD
EVER MET WITH. THE KING, THE QUEEN, BUCKINGHAM, WOLSEY, CROMWELL, ALL
WERE GIVEN IN TURN; FOR WITH THE HAPPIEST KNACK, THE HAPPIEST POWER OF
JUMPING AND GUESSING, HE COULD ALWAYS ALIGHT AT WILL ON THE BEST SCENE,
OR THE BEST SPEECHES OF EACH; AND WHETHER IT WERE DIGNITY, OR PRIDE, OR
TENDERNESS, OR REMORSE, OR WHATEVER WERE TO BE EXPRESSED, HE COULD DO
IT WITH EQUAL BEAUTY. IT WAS TRULY DRAMATIC. HIS ACTING HAD FIRST TAUGHT
FANNY WHAT PLEASURE A PLAY MIGHT GIVE, AND HIS READING BROUGHT ALL HIS
ACTING BEFORE HER AGAIN; NAY, PERHAPS WITH GREATER ENJOYMENT, FOR IT
CAME UNEXPECTEDLY, AND WITH NO SUCH DRAWBACK AS SHE HAD BEEN USED TO
SUFFER IN SEEING HIM ON THE STAGE WITH MISS BERTRAM.

EDMUND WATCHED THE PROGRESS OF HER ATTENTION, AND WAS AMUSED AND
GRATIFIED BY SEEING HOW SHE GRADUALLY SLACKENED IN THE NEEDLEWORK, WHICH
AT THE BEGINNING SEEMED TO OCCUPY HER TOTALLY: HOW IT FELL FROM HER HAND
WHILE SHE SAT MOTIONLESS OVER IT, AND AT LAST, HOW THE EYES WHICH HAD
APPEARED SO STUDIOUSLY TO AVOID HIM THROUGHOUT THE DAY WERE TURNED AND
FIXED ON CRAWFORD--FIXED ON HIM FOR MINUTES, FIXED ON HIM, IN SHORT,
TILL THE ATTRACTION DREW CRAWFORD'S UPON HER, AND THE BOOK WAS CLOSED,
AND THE CHARM WAS BROKEN. THEN SHE WAS SHRINKING AGAIN INTO HERSELF,
AND BLUSHING AND WORKING AS HARD AS EVER; BUT IT HAD BEEN ENOUGH TO GIVE
EDMUND ENCOURAGEMENT FOR HIS FRIEND, AND AS HE CORDIALLY THANKED HIM, HE
HOPED TO BE EXPRESSING FANNY'S SECRET FEELINGS TOO.

"THAT PLAY MUST BE A FAVOURITE WITH YOU," SAID HE; "YOU READ AS IF YOU
KNEW IT WELL."

"IT WILL BE A FAVOURITE, I BELIEVE, FROM THIS HOUR," REPLIED CRAWFORD;
"BUT I DO NOT THINK I HAVE HAD A VOLUME OF SHAKESPEARE IN MY HAND BEFORE
SINCE I WAS FIFTEEN. I ONCE SAW HENRY THE EIGHTH ACTED, OR I HAVE HEARD
OF IT FROM SOMEBODY WHO DID, I AM NOT CERTAIN WHICH. BUT SHAKESPEARE
ONE GETS ACQUAINTED WITH WITHOUT KNOWING HOW. IT IS A PART OF AN
ENGLISHMAN'S CONSTITUTION. HIS THOUGHTS AND BEAUTIES ARE SO SPREAD
ABROAD THAT ONE TOUCHES THEM EVERYWHERE; ONE IS INTIMATE WITH HIM BY
INSTINCT. NO MAN OF ANY BRAIN CAN OPEN AT A GOOD PART OF ONE OF HIS
PLAYS WITHOUT FALLING INTO THE FLOW OF HIS MEANING IMMEDIATELY."

"NO DOUBT ONE IS FAMILIAR WITH SHAKESPEARE IN A DEGREE," SAID EDMUND,
"FROM ONE'S EARLIEST YEARS. HIS CELEBRATED PASSAGES ARE QUOTED
BY EVERYBODY; THEY ARE IN HALF THE BOOKS WE OPEN, AND WE ALL TALK
SHAKESPEARE, USE HIS SIMILES, AND DESCRIBE WITH HIS DESCRIPTIONS; BUT
THIS IS TOTALLY DISTINCT FROM GIVING HIS SENSE AS YOU GAVE IT. TO KNOW
HIM IN BITS AND SCRAPS IS COMMON ENOUGH; TO KNOW HIM PRETTY THOROUGHLY
IS, PERHAPS, NOT UNCOMMON; BUT TO READ HIM WELL ALOUD IS NO EVERYDAY
TALENT."

"SIR, YOU DO ME HONOUR," WAS CRAWFORD'S ANSWER, WITH A BOW OF MOCK
GRAVITY.

BOTH GENTLEMEN HAD A GLANCE AT FANNY, TO SEE IF A WORD OF ACCORDANT
PRAISE COULD BE EXTORTED FROM HER; YET BOTH FEELING THAT IT COULD NOT
BE. HER PRAISE HAD BEEN GIVEN IN HER ATTENTION; THAT MUST CONTENT
THEM.

LADY BERTRAM'S ADMIRATION WAS EXPRESSED, AND STRONGLY TOO. "IT WAS
REALLY LIKE BEING AT A PLAY," SAID SHE. "I WISH SIR THOMAS HAD BEEN
HERE."

CRAWFORD WAS EXCESSIVELY PLEASED. IF LADY BERTRAM, WITH ALL HER
INCOMPETENCY AND LANGUOR, COULD FEEL THIS, THE INFERENCE OF WHAT HER
NIECE, ALIVE AND ENLIGHTENED AS SHE WAS, MUST FEEL, WAS ELEVATING.

"YOU HAVE A GREAT TURN FOR ACTING, I AM SURE, MR. CRAWFORD," SAID HER
LADYSHIP SOON AFTERWARDS; "AND I WILL TELL YOU WHAT, I THINK YOU WILL
HAVE A THEATRE, SOME TIME OR OTHER, AT YOUR HOUSE IN NORFOLK. I MEAN
WHEN YOU ARE SETTLED THERE. I DO INDEED. I THINK YOU WILL FIT UP A
THEATRE AT YOUR HOUSE IN NORFOLK."

"DO YOU, MA'AM?" CRIED HE, WITH QUICKNESS. "NO, NO, THAT WILL NEVER BE.
YOUR LADYSHIP IS QUITE MISTAKEN. NO THEATRE AT EVERINGHAM! OH NO!" AND
HE LOOKED AT FANNY WITH AN EXPRESSIVE SMILE, WHICH EVIDENTLY MEANT,
"THAT LADY WILL NEVER ALLOW A THEATRE AT EVERINGHAM."

EDMUND SAW IT ALL, AND SAW FANNY SO DETERMINED NOT TO SEE IT, AS TO
MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THE VOICE WAS ENOUGH TO CONVEY THE FULL MEANING OF
THE PROTESTATION; AND SUCH A QUICK CONSCIOUSNESS OF COMPLIMENT, SUCH A
READY COMPREHENSION OF A HINT, HE THOUGHT, WAS RATHER FAVOURABLE THAN
NOT.

THE SUBJECT OF READING ALOUD WAS FARTHER DISCUSSED. THE TWO YOUNG MEN
WERE THE ONLY TALKERS, BUT THEY, STANDING BY THE FIRE, TALKED OVER THE
TOO COMMON NEGLECT OF THE QUALIFICATION, THE TOTAL INATTENTION TO IT,
IN THE ORDINARY SCHOOL-SYSTEM FOR BOYS, THE CONSEQUENTLY NATURAL, YET IN
SOME INSTANCES ALMOST UNNATURAL, DEGREE OF IGNORANCE AND UNCOUTHNESS
OF MEN, OF SENSIBLE AND WELL-INFORMED MEN, WHEN SUDDENLY CALLED TO THE
NECESSITY OF READING ALOUD, WHICH HAD FALLEN WITHIN THEIR NOTICE, GIVING
INSTANCES OF BLUNDERS, AND FAILURES WITH THEIR SECONDARY CAUSES, THE
WANT OF MANAGEMENT OF THE VOICE, OF PROPER MODULATION AND EMPHASIS, OF
FORESIGHT AND JUDGMENT, ALL PROCEEDING FROM THE FIRST CAUSE: WANT OF
EARLY ATTENTION AND HABIT; AND FANNY WAS LISTENING AGAIN WITH GREAT
ENTERTAINMENT.

"EVEN IN MY PROFESSION," SAID EDMUND, WITH A SMILE, "HOW LITTLE THE
ART OF READING HAS BEEN STUDIED! HOW LITTLE A CLEAR MANNER, AND GOOD
DELIVERY, HAVE BEEN ATTENDED TO! I SPEAK RATHER OF THE PAST, HOWEVER,
THAN THE PRESENT. THERE IS NOW A SPIRIT OF IMPROVEMENT ABROAD; BUT AMONG
THOSE WHO WERE ORDAINED TWENTY, THIRTY, FORTY YEARS AGO, THE LARGER
NUMBER, TO JUDGE BY THEIR PERFORMANCE, MUST HAVE THOUGHT READING WAS
READING, AND PREACHING WAS PREACHING. IT IS DIFFERENT NOW. THE SUBJECT
IS MORE JUSTLY CONSIDERED. IT IS FELT THAT DISTINCTNESS AND ENERGY MAY
HAVE WEIGHT IN RECOMMENDING THE MOST SOLID TRUTHS; AND BESIDES, THERE IS
MORE GENERAL OBSERVATION AND TASTE, A MORE CRITICAL KNOWLEDGE DIFFUSED
THAN FORMERLY; IN EVERY CONGREGATION THERE IS A LARGER PROPORTION WHO
KNOW A LITTLE OF THE MATTER, AND WHO CAN JUDGE AND CRITICISE."

EDMUND HAD ALREADY GONE THROUGH THE SERVICE ONCE SINCE HIS ORDINATION;
AND UPON THIS BEING UNDERSTOOD, HE HAD A VARIETY OF QUESTIONS FROM
CRAWFORD AS TO HIS FEELINGS AND SUCCESS; QUESTIONS, WHICH BEING MADE,
THOUGH WITH THE VIVACITY OF FRIENDLY INTEREST AND QUICK TASTE, WITHOUT
ANY TOUCH OF THAT SPIRIT OF BANTER OR AIR OF LEVITY WHICH EDMUND KNEW TO
BE MOST OFFENSIVE TO FANNY, HE HAD TRUE PLEASURE IN SATISFYING; AND
WHEN CRAWFORD PROCEEDED TO ASK HIS OPINION AND GIVE HIS OWN AS TO THE
PROPEREST MANNER IN WHICH PARTICULAR PASSAGES IN THE SERVICE SHOULD BE
DELIVERED, SHEWING IT TO BE A SUBJECT ON WHICH HE HAD THOUGHT BEFORE,
AND THOUGHT WITH JUDGMENT, EDMUND WAS STILL MORE AND MORE PLEASED. THIS
WOULD BE THE WAY TO FANNY'S HEART. SHE WAS NOT TO BE WON BY ALL THAT
GALLANTRY AND WIT AND GOOD-NATURE TOGETHER COULD DO; OR, AT LEAST,
SHE WOULD NOT BE WON BY THEM NEARLY SO SOON, WITHOUT THE ASSISTANCE OF
SENTIMENT AND FEELING, AND SERIOUSNESS ON SERIOUS SUBJECTS.

"OUR LITURGY," OBSERVED CRAWFORD, "HAS BEAUTIES, WHICH NOT EVEN A
CARELESS, SLOVENLY STYLE OF READING CAN DESTROY; BUT IT HAS ALSO
REDUNDANCIES AND REPETITIONS WHICH REQUIRE GOOD READING NOT TO BE FELT.
FOR MYSELF, AT LEAST, I MUST CONFESS BEING NOT ALWAYS SO ATTENTIVE AS I
OUGHT TO BE" (HERE WAS A GLANCE AT FANNY); "THAT NINETEEN TIMES OUT OF
TWENTY I AM THINKING HOW SUCH A PRAYER OUGHT TO BE READ, AND LONGING TO
HAVE IT TO READ MYSELF. DID YOU SPEAK?" STEPPING EAGERLY TO FANNY, AND
ADDRESSING HER IN A SOFTENED VOICE; AND UPON HER SAYING "NO," HE ADDED,
"ARE YOU SURE YOU DID NOT SPEAK? I SAW YOUR LIPS MOVE. I FANCIED YOU
MIGHT BE GOING TO TELL ME I OUGHT TO BE MORE ATTENTIVE, AND NOT ALLOW
MY THOUGHTS TO WANDER. ARE NOT YOU GOING TO TELL ME SO?"

"NO, INDEED, YOU KNOW YOUR DUTY TOO WELL FOR ME TO--EVEN SUPPOSING--"

SHE STOPT, FELT HERSELF GETTING INTO A PUZZLE, AND COULD NOT BE
PREVAILED ON TO ADD ANOTHER WORD, NOT BY DINT OF SEVERAL MINUTES OF
SUPPLICATION AND WAITING. HE THEN RETURNED TO HIS FORMER STATION, AND
WENT ON AS IF THERE HAD BEEN NO SUCH TENDER INTERRUPTION.

"A SERMON, WELL DELIVERED, IS MORE UNCOMMON EVEN THAN PRAYERS WELL READ.
A SERMON, GOOD IN ITSELF, IS NO RARE THING. IT IS MORE DIFFICULT
TO SPEAK WELL THAN TO COMPOSE WELL; THAT IS, THE RULES AND TRICK OF
COMPOSITION ARE OFTENER AN OBJECT OF STUDY. A THOROUGHLY GOOD SERMON,
THOROUGHLY WELL DELIVERED, IS A CAPITAL GRATIFICATION. I CAN NEVER HEAR
SUCH A ONE WITHOUT THE GREATEST ADMIRATION AND RESPECT, AND MORE THAN
HALF A MIND TO TAKE ORDERS AND PREACH MYSELF. THERE IS SOMETHING IN THE
ELOQUENCE OF THE PULPIT, WHEN IT IS REALLY ELOQUENCE, WHICH IS ENTITLED
TO THE HIGHEST PRAISE AND HONOUR. THE PREACHER WHO CAN TOUCH AND AFFECT
SUCH AN HETEROGENEOUS MASS OF HEARERS, ON SUBJECTS LIMITED, AND LONG
WORN THREADBARE IN ALL COMMON HANDS; WHO CAN SAY ANYTHING NEW OR
STRIKING, ANYTHING THAT ROUSES THE ATTENTION WITHOUT OFFENDING THE
TASTE, OR WEARING OUT THE FEELINGS OF HIS HEARERS, IS A MAN WHOM ONE
COULD NOT, IN HIS PUBLIC CAPACITY, HONOUR ENOUGH. I SHOULD LIKE TO BE
SUCH A MAN."

EDMUND LAUGHED.

"I SHOULD INDEED. I NEVER LISTENED TO A DISTINGUISHED PREACHER IN MY
LIFE WITHOUT A SORT OF ENVY. BUT THEN, I MUST HAVE A LONDON AUDIENCE.
I COULD NOT PREACH BUT TO THE EDUCATED; TO THOSE WHO WERE CAPABLE OF
ESTIMATING MY COMPOSITION. AND I DO NOT KNOW THAT I SHOULD BE FOND OF
PREACHING OFTEN; NOW AND THEN, PERHAPS ONCE OR TWICE IN THE SPRING,
AFTER BEING ANXIOUSLY EXPECTED FOR HALF A DOZEN SUNDAYS TOGETHER; BUT
NOT FOR A CONSTANCY; IT WOULD NOT DO FOR A CONSTANCY."

HERE FANNY, WHO COULD NOT BUT LISTEN, INVOLUNTARILY SHOOK HER HEAD,
AND CRAWFORD WAS INSTANTLY BY HER SIDE AGAIN, ENTREATING TO KNOW HER
MEANING; AND AS EDMUND PERCEIVED, BY HIS DRAWING IN A CHAIR, AND SITTING
DOWN CLOSE BY HER, THAT IT WAS TO BE A VERY THOROUGH ATTACK, THAT LOOKS
AND UNDERTONES WERE TO BE WELL TRIED, HE SANK AS QUIETLY AS POSSIBLE
INTO A CORNER, TURNED HIS BACK, AND TOOK UP A NEWSPAPER, VERY SINCERELY
WISHING THAT DEAR LITTLE FANNY MIGHT BE PERSUADED INTO EXPLAINING AWAY
THAT SHAKE OF THE HEAD TO THE SATISFACTION OF HER ARDENT LOVER; AND AS
EARNESTLY TRYING TO BURY EVERY SOUND OF THE BUSINESS FROM HIMSELF IN
MURMURS OF HIS OWN, OVER THE VARIOUS ADVERTISEMENTS OF "A MOST DESIRABLE
ESTATE IN SOUTH WALES"; "TO PARENTS AND GUARDIANS"; AND A "CAPITAL
SEASON'D HUNTER."

FANNY, MEANWHILE, VEXED WITH HERSELF FOR NOT HAVING BEEN AS MOTIONLESS
AS SHE WAS SPEECHLESS, AND GRIEVED TO THE HEART TO SEE EDMUND'S
ARRANGEMENTS, WAS TRYING BY EVERYTHING IN THE POWER OF HER MODEST,
GENTLE NATURE, TO REPULSE MR. CRAWFORD, AND AVOID BOTH HIS LOOKS AND
INQUIRIES; AND HE, UNREPULSABLE, WAS PERSISTING IN BOTH.

"WHAT DID THAT SHAKE OF THE HEAD MEAN?" SAID HE. "WHAT WAS IT MEANT TO
EXPRESS? DISAPPROBATION, I FEAR. BUT OF WHAT? WHAT HAD I BEEN SAYING
TO DISPLEASE YOU? DID YOU THINK ME SPEAKING IMPROPERLY, LIGHTLY,
IRREVERENTLY ON THE SUBJECT? ONLY TELL ME IF I WAS. ONLY TELL ME IF
I WAS WRONG. I WANT TO BE SET RIGHT. NAY, NAY, I ENTREAT YOU; FOR ONE
MOMENT PUT DOWN YOUR WORK. WHAT DID THAT SHAKE OF THE HEAD MEAN?"

IN VAIN WAS HER "PRAY, SIR, DON'T; PRAY, MR. CRAWFORD," REPEATED TWICE
OVER; AND IN VAIN DID SHE TRY TO MOVE AWAY. IN THE SAME LOW, EAGER
VOICE, AND THE SAME CLOSE NEIGHBOURHOOD, HE WENT ON, REURGING THE SAME
QUESTIONS AS BEFORE. SHE GREW MORE AGITATED AND DISPLEASED.

"HOW CAN YOU, SIR? YOU QUITE ASTONISH ME; I WONDER HOW YOU CAN--"

"DO I ASTONISH YOU?" SAID HE. "DO YOU WONDER? IS THERE ANYTHING IN
MY PRESENT ENTREATY THAT YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND? I WILL EXPLAIN TO YOU
INSTANTLY ALL THAT MAKES ME URGE YOU IN THIS MANNER, ALL THAT GIVES ME
AN INTEREST IN WHAT YOU LOOK AND DO, AND EXCITES MY PRESENT CURIOSITY. I
WILL NOT LEAVE YOU TO WONDER LONG."

IN SPITE OF HERSELF, SHE COULD NOT HELP HALF A SMILE, BUT SHE SAID
NOTHING.

"YOU SHOOK YOUR HEAD AT MY ACKNOWLEDGING THAT I SHOULD NOT LIKE TO
ENGAGE IN THE DUTIES OF A CLERGYMAN ALWAYS FOR A CONSTANCY. YES, THAT
WAS THE WORD. CONSTANCY: I AM NOT AFRAID OF THE WORD. I WOULD SPELL IT,
READ IT, WRITE IT WITH ANYBODY. I SEE NOTHING ALARMING IN THE WORD. DID
YOU THINK I OUGHT?"

"PERHAPS, SIR," SAID FANNY, WEARIED AT LAST INTO SPEAKING--"PERHAPS,
SIR, I THOUGHT IT WAS A PITY YOU DID NOT ALWAYS KNOW YOURSELF AS WELL AS
YOU SEEMED TO DO AT THAT MOMENT."

CRAWFORD, DELIGHTED TO GET HER TO SPEAK AT ANY RATE, WAS DETERMINED
TO KEEP IT UP; AND POOR FANNY, WHO HAD HOPED TO SILENCE HIM BY SUCH AN
EXTREMITY OF REPROOF, FOUND HERSELF SADLY MISTAKEN, AND THAT IT WAS ONLY
A CHANGE FROM ONE OBJECT OF CURIOSITY AND ONE SET OF WORDS TO ANOTHER.
HE HAD ALWAYS SOMETHING TO ENTREAT THE EXPLANATION OF. THE OPPORTUNITY
WAS TOO FAIR. NONE SUCH HAD OCCURRED SINCE HIS SEEING HER IN HER UNCLE'S
ROOM, NONE SUCH MIGHT OCCUR AGAIN BEFORE HIS LEAVING MANSFIELD. LADY
BERTRAM'S BEING JUST ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TABLE WAS A TRIFLE,
FOR SHE MIGHT ALWAYS BE CONSIDERED AS ONLY HALF-AWAKE, AND EDMUND'S
ADVERTISEMENTS WERE STILL OF THE FIRST UTILITY.

"WELL," SAID CRAWFORD, AFTER A COURSE OF RAPID QUESTIONS AND RELUCTANT
ANSWERS; "I AM HAPPIER THAN I WAS, BECAUSE I NOW UNDERSTAND MORE CLEARLY
YOUR OPINION OF ME. YOU THINK ME UNSTEADY: EASILY SWAYED BY THE WHIM OF
THE MOMENT, EASILY TEMPTED, EASILY PUT ASIDE. WITH SUCH AN OPINION, NO
WONDER THAT. BUT WE SHALL SEE. IT IS NOT BY PROTESTATIONS THAT I SHALL
ENDEAVOUR TO CONVINCE YOU I AM WRONGED; IT IS NOT BY TELLING YOU THAT MY
AFFECTIONS ARE STEADY. MY CONDUCT SHALL SPEAK FOR ME; ABSENCE, DISTANCE,
TIME SHALL SPEAK FOR ME. THEY SHALL PROVE THAT, AS FAR AS YOU CAN BE
DESERVED BY ANYBODY, I DO DESERVE YOU. YOU ARE INFINITELY MY SUPERIOR
IN MERIT; ALL THAT I KNOW. YOU HAVE QUALITIES WHICH I HAD NOT BEFORE
SUPPOSED TO EXIST IN SUCH A DEGREE IN ANY HUMAN CREATURE. YOU HAVE SOME
TOUCHES OF THE ANGEL IN YOU BEYOND WHAT--NOT MERELY BEYOND WHAT ONE
SEES, BECAUSE ONE NEVER SEES ANYTHING LIKE IT--BUT BEYOND WHAT ONE
FANCIES MIGHT BE. BUT STILL I AM NOT FRIGHTENED. IT IS NOT BY EQUALITY
OF MERIT THAT YOU CAN BE WON. THAT IS OUT OF THE QUESTION. IT IS HE
WHO SEES AND WORSHIPS YOUR MERIT THE STRONGEST, WHO LOVES YOU MOST
DEVOTEDLY, THAT HAS THE BEST RIGHT TO A RETURN. THERE I BUILD MY
CONFIDENCE. BY THAT RIGHT I DO AND WILL DESERVE YOU; AND WHEN ONCE
CONVINCED THAT MY ATTACHMENT IS WHAT I DECLARE IT, I KNOW YOU TOO WELL
NOT TO ENTERTAIN THE WARMEST HOPES. YES, DEAREST, SWEETEST FANNY. NAY"
(SEEING HER DRAW BACK DISPLEASED), "FORGIVE ME. PERHAPS I HAVE AS YET
NO RIGHT; BUT BY WHAT OTHER NAME CAN I CALL YOU? DO YOU SUPPOSE YOU ARE
EVER PRESENT TO MY IMAGINATION UNDER ANY OTHER? NO, IT IS 'FANNY' THAT
I THINK OF ALL DAY, AND DREAM OF ALL NIGHT. YOU HAVE GIVEN THE NAME SUCH
REALITY OF SWEETNESS, THAT NOTHING ELSE CAN NOW BE DESCRIPTIVE OF YOU."

FANNY COULD HARDLY HAVE KEPT HER SEAT ANY LONGER, OR HAVE REFRAINED FROM
AT LEAST TRYING TO GET AWAY IN SPITE OF ALL THE TOO PUBLIC OPPOSITION
SHE FORESAW TO IT, HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE SOUND OF APPROACHING RELIEF,
THE VERY SOUND WHICH SHE HAD BEEN LONG WATCHING FOR, AND LONG THINKING
STRANGELY DELAYED.

THE SOLEMN PROCESSION, HEADED BY BADDELEY, OF TEA-BOARD, URN, AND
CAKE-BEARERS, MADE ITS APPEARANCE, AND DELIVERED HER FROM A GRIEVOUS
IMPRISONMENT OF BODY AND MIND. MR. CRAWFORD WAS OBLIGED TO MOVE. SHE WAS
AT LIBERTY, SHE WAS BUSY, SHE WAS PROTECTED.

EDMUND WAS NOT SORRY TO BE ADMITTED AGAIN AMONG THE NUMBER OF THOSE WHO
MIGHT SPEAK AND HEAR. BUT THOUGH THE CONFERENCE HAD SEEMED FULL LONG TO
HIM, AND THOUGH ON LOOKING AT FANNY HE SAW RATHER A FLUSH OF VEXATION,
HE INCLINED TO HOPE THAT SO MUCH COULD NOT HAVE BEEN SAID AND LISTENED
TO WITHOUT SOME PROFIT TO THE SPEAKER.



CHAPTER XXXV

EDMUND HAD DETERMINED THAT IT BELONGED ENTIRELY TO FANNY TO CHUSE
WHETHER HER SITUATION WITH REGARD TO CRAWFORD SHOULD BE MENTIONED
BETWEEN THEM OR NOT; AND THAT IF SHE DID NOT LEAD THE WAY, IT SHOULD
NEVER BE TOUCHED ON BY HIM; BUT AFTER A DAY OR TWO OF MUTUAL RESERVE, HE
WAS INDUCED BY HIS FATHER TO CHANGE HIS MIND, AND TRY WHAT HIS INFLUENCE
MIGHT DO FOR HIS FRIEND.

A DAY, AND A VERY EARLY DAY, WAS ACTUALLY FIXED FOR THE CRAWFORDS'
DEPARTURE; AND SIR THOMAS THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE AS WELL TO MAKE ONE
MORE EFFORT FOR THE YOUNG MAN BEFORE HE LEFT MANSFIELD, THAT ALL HIS
PROFESSIONS AND VOWS OF UNSHAKEN ATTACHMENT MIGHT HAVE AS MUCH HOPE TO
SUSTAIN THEM AS POSSIBLE.

SIR THOMAS WAS MOST CORDIALLY ANXIOUS FOR THE PERFECTION OF MR.
CRAWFORD'S CHARACTER IN THAT POINT. HE WISHED HIM TO BE A MODEL OF
CONSTANCY; AND FANCIED THE BEST MEANS OF EFFECTING IT WOULD BE BY NOT
TRYING HIM TOO LONG.

EDMUND WAS NOT UNWILLING TO BE PERSUADED TO ENGAGE IN THE BUSINESS; HE
WANTED TO KNOW FANNY'S FEELINGS. SHE HAD BEEN USED TO CONSULT HIM IN
EVERY DIFFICULTY, AND HE LOVED HER TOO WELL TO BEAR TO BE DENIED HER
CONFIDENCE NOW; HE HOPED TO BE OF SERVICE TO HER, HE THOUGHT HE MUST BE
OF SERVICE TO HER; WHOM ELSE HAD SHE TO OPEN HER HEART TO? IF SHE DID
NOT NEED COUNSEL, SHE MUST NEED THE COMFORT OF COMMUNICATION. FANNY
ESTRANGED FROM HIM, SILENT AND RESERVED, WAS AN UNNATURAL STATE OF
THINGS; A STATE WHICH HE MUST BREAK THROUGH, AND WHICH HE COULD EASILY
LEARN TO THINK SHE WAS WANTING HIM TO BREAK THROUGH.

"I WILL SPEAK TO HER, SIR: I WILL TAKE THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY OF SPEAKING
TO HER ALONE," WAS THE RESULT OF SUCH THOUGHTS AS THESE; AND UPON SIR
THOMAS'S INFORMATION OF HER BEING AT THAT VERY TIME WALKING ALONE IN THE
SHRUBBERY, HE INSTANTLY JOINED HER.

"I AM COME TO WALK WITH YOU, FANNY," SAID HE. "SHALL I?" DRAWING HER
ARM WITHIN HIS. "IT IS A LONG WHILE SINCE WE HAVE HAD A COMFORTABLE WALK
TOGETHER."

SHE ASSENTED TO IT ALL RATHER BY LOOK THAN WORD. HER SPIRITS WERE LOW.

"BUT, FANNY," HE PRESENTLY ADDED, "IN ORDER TO HAVE A COMFORTABLE WALK,
SOMETHING MORE IS NECESSARY THAN MERELY PACING THIS GRAVEL TOGETHER. YOU
MUST TALK TO ME. I KNOW YOU HAVE SOMETHING ON YOUR MIND. I KNOW WHAT YOU
ARE THINKING OF. YOU CANNOT SUPPOSE ME UNINFORMED. AM I TO HEAR OF IT
FROM EVERYBODY BUT FANNY HERSELF?"

FANNY, AT ONCE AGITATED AND DEJECTED, REPLIED, "IF YOU HEAR OF IT FROM
EVERYBODY, COUSIN, THERE CAN BE NOTHING FOR ME TO TELL."

"NOT OF FACTS, PERHAPS; BUT OF FEELINGS, FANNY. NO ONE BUT YOU CAN TELL
ME THEM. I DO NOT MEAN TO PRESS YOU, HOWEVER. IF IT IS NOT WHAT YOU WISH
YOURSELF, I HAVE DONE. I HAD THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE A RELIEF."

"I AM AFRAID WE THINK TOO DIFFERENTLY FOR ME TO FIND ANY RELIEF IN
TALKING OF WHAT I FEEL."

"DO YOU SUPPOSE THAT WE THINK DIFFERENTLY? I HAVE NO IDEA OF IT. I DARE
SAY THAT, ON A COMPARISON OF OUR OPINIONS, THEY WOULD BE FOUND AS MUCH
ALIKE AS THEY HAVE BEEN USED TO BE: TO THE POINT--I CONSIDER CRAWFORD'S
PROPOSALS AS MOST ADVANTAGEOUS AND DESIRABLE, IF YOU COULD RETURN HIS
AFFECTION. I CONSIDER IT AS MOST NATURAL THAT ALL YOUR FAMILY SHOULD
WISH YOU COULD RETURN IT; BUT THAT, AS YOU CANNOT, YOU HAVE DONE EXACTLY
AS YOU OUGHT IN REFUSING HIM. CAN THERE BE ANY DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN US
HERE?"

"OH NO! BUT I THOUGHT YOU BLAMED ME. I THOUGHT YOU WERE AGAINST ME. THIS
IS SUCH A COMFORT!"

"THIS COMFORT YOU MIGHT HAVE HAD SOONER, FANNY, HAD YOU SOUGHT IT. BUT
HOW COULD YOU POSSIBLY SUPPOSE ME AGAINST YOU? HOW COULD YOU IMAGINE ME
AN ADVOCATE FOR MARRIAGE WITHOUT LOVE? WERE I EVEN CARELESS IN GENERAL
ON SUCH MATTERS, HOW COULD YOU IMAGINE ME SO WHERE YOUR HAPPINESS WAS AT
STAKE?"

"MY UNCLE THOUGHT ME WRONG, AND I KNEW HE HAD BEEN TALKING TO YOU."

"AS FAR AS YOU HAVE GONE, FANNY, I THINK YOU PERFECTLY RIGHT. I MAY BE
SORRY, I MAY BE SURPRISED--THOUGH HARDLY THAT, FOR YOU HAD NOT HAD
TIME TO ATTACH YOURSELF--BUT I THINK YOU PERFECTLY RIGHT. CAN IT ADMIT
OF A QUESTION? IT IS DISGRACEFUL TO US IF IT DOES. YOU DID NOT LOVE HIM;
NOTHING COULD HAVE JUSTIFIED YOUR ACCEPTING HIM."

FANNY HAD NOT FELT SO COMFORTABLE FOR DAYS AND DAYS.

"SO FAR YOUR CONDUCT HAS BEEN FAULTLESS, AND THEY WERE QUITE MISTAKEN
WHO WISHED YOU TO DO OTHERWISE. BUT THE MATTER DOES NOT END HERE.
CRAWFORD'S IS NO COMMON ATTACHMENT; HE PERSEVERES, WITH THE HOPE OF
CREATING THAT REGARD WHICH HAD NOT BEEN CREATED BEFORE. THIS, WE KNOW,
MUST BE A WORK OF TIME. BUT" (WITH AN AFFECTIONATE SMILE) "LET HIM
SUCCEED AT LAST, FANNY, LET HIM SUCCEED AT LAST. YOU HAVE PROVED
YOURSELF UPRIGHT AND DISINTERESTED, PROVE YOURSELF GRATEFUL AND
TENDER-HEARTED; AND THEN YOU WILL BE THE PERFECT MODEL OF A WOMAN WHICH
I HAVE ALWAYS BELIEVED YOU BORN FOR."

"OH! NEVER, NEVER, NEVER! HE NEVER WILL SUCCEED WITH ME." AND SHE SPOKE
WITH A WARMTH WHICH QUITE ASTONISHED EDMUND, AND WHICH SHE BLUSHED AT
THE RECOLLECTION OF HERSELF, WHEN SHE SAW HIS LOOK, AND HEARD HIM
REPLY, "NEVER! FANNY!--SO VERY DETERMINED AND POSITIVE! THIS IS NOT LIKE
YOURSELF, YOUR RATIONAL SELF."

"I MEAN," SHE CRIED, SORROWFULLY CORRECTING HERSELF, "THAT I THINK I
NEVER SHALL, AS FAR AS THE FUTURE CAN BE ANSWERED FOR; I THINK I NEVER
SHALL RETURN HIS REGARD."

"I MUST HOPE BETTER THINGS. I AM AWARE, MORE AWARE THAN CRAWFORD CAN BE,
THAT THE MAN WHO MEANS TO MAKE YOU LOVE HIM (YOU HAVING DUE NOTICE OF
HIS INTENTIONS) MUST HAVE VERY UPHILL WORK, FOR THERE ARE ALL YOUR EARLY
ATTACHMENTS AND HABITS IN BATTLE ARRAY; AND BEFORE HE CAN GET YOUR HEART
FOR HIS OWN USE HE HAS TO UNFASTEN IT FROM ALL THE HOLDS UPON THINGS
ANIMATE AND INANIMATE, WHICH SO MANY YEARS' GROWTH HAVE CONFIRMED, AND
WHICH ARE CONSIDERABLY TIGHTENED FOR THE MOMENT BY THE VERY IDEA
OF SEPARATION. I KNOW THAT THE APPREHENSION OF BEING FORCED TO QUIT
MANSFIELD WILL FOR A TIME BE ARMING YOU AGAINST HIM. I WISH HE HAD NOT
BEEN OBLIGED TO TELL YOU WHAT HE WAS TRYING FOR. I WISH HE HAD KNOWN YOU
AS WELL AS I DO, FANNY. BETWEEN US, I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE WON YOU. MY
THEORETICAL AND HIS PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE TOGETHER COULD NOT HAVE FAILED.
HE SHOULD HAVE WORKED UPON MY PLANS. I MUST HOPE, HOWEVER, THAT TIME,
PROVING HIM (AS I FIRMLY BELIEVE IT WILL) TO DESERVE YOU BY HIS STEADY
AFFECTION, WILL GIVE HIM HIS REWARD. I CANNOT SUPPOSE THAT YOU HAVE NOT
THE WISH TO LOVE HIM--THE NATURAL WISH OF GRATITUDE. YOU MUST HAVE
SOME FEELING OF THAT SORT. YOU MUST BE SORRY FOR YOUR OWN INDIFFERENCE."

"WE ARE SO TOTALLY UNLIKE," SAID FANNY, AVOIDING A DIRECT ANSWER, "WE
ARE SO VERY, VERY DIFFERENT IN ALL OUR INCLINATIONS AND WAYS, THAT
I CONSIDER IT AS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE WE SHOULD EVER BE TOLERABLY HAPPY
TOGETHER, EVEN IF I COULD LIKE HIM. THERE NEVER WERE TWO PEOPLE MORE
DISSIMILAR. WE HAVE NOT ONE TASTE IN COMMON. WE SHOULD BE MISERABLE."

"YOU ARE MISTAKEN, FANNY. THE DISSIMILARITY IS NOT SO STRONG. YOU ARE
QUITE ENOUGH ALIKE. YOU HAVE TASTES IN COMMON. YOU HAVE MORAL AND
LITERARY TASTES IN COMMON. YOU HAVE BOTH WARM HEARTS AND BENEVOLENT
FEELINGS; AND, FANNY, WHO THAT HEARD HIM READ, AND SAW YOU LISTEN TO
SHAKESPEARE THE OTHER NIGHT, WILL THINK YOU UNFITTED AS COMPANIONS? YOU
FORGET YOURSELF: THERE IS A DECIDED DIFFERENCE IN YOUR TEMPERS, I ALLOW.
HE IS LIVELY, YOU ARE SERIOUS; BUT SO MUCH THE BETTER: HIS SPIRITS WILL
SUPPORT YOURS. IT IS YOUR DISPOSITION TO BE EASILY DEJECTED AND TO FANCY
DIFFICULTIES GREATER THAN THEY ARE. HIS CHEERFULNESS WILL COUNTERACT
THIS. HE SEES DIFFICULTIES NOWHERE: AND HIS PLEASANTNESS AND GAIETY WILL
BE A CONSTANT SUPPORT TO YOU. YOUR BEING SO FAR UNLIKE, FANNY, DOES NOT
IN THE SMALLEST DEGREE MAKE AGAINST THE PROBABILITY OF YOUR HAPPINESS
TOGETHER: DO NOT IMAGINE IT. I AM MYSELF CONVINCED THAT IT IS RATHER A
FAVOURABLE CIRCUMSTANCE. I AM PERFECTLY PERSUADED THAT THE TEMPERS
HAD BETTER BE UNLIKE: I MEAN UNLIKE IN THE FLOW OF THE SPIRITS, IN
THE MANNERS, IN THE INCLINATION FOR MUCH OR LITTLE COMPANY, IN THE
PROPENSITY TO TALK OR TO BE SILENT, TO BE GRAVE OR TO BE GAY. SOME
OPPOSITION HERE IS, I AM THOROUGHLY CONVINCED, FRIENDLY TO MATRIMONIAL
HAPPINESS. I EXCLUDE EXTREMES, OF COURSE; AND A VERY CLOSE RESEMBLANCE
IN ALL THOSE POINTS WOULD BE THE LIKELIEST WAY TO PRODUCE AN EXTREME.
A COUNTERACTION, GENTLE AND CONTINUAL, IS THE BEST SAFEGUARD OF MANNERS
AND CONDUCT."

FULL WELL COULD FANNY GUESS WHERE HIS THOUGHTS WERE NOW: MISS CRAWFORD'S
POWER WAS ALL RETURNING. HE HAD BEEN SPEAKING OF HER CHEERFULLY FROM THE
HOUR OF HIS COMING HOME. HIS AVOIDING HER WAS QUITE AT AN END. HE HAD
DINED AT THE PARSONAGE ONLY THE PRECEDING DAY.

AFTER LEAVING HIM TO HIS HAPPIER THOUGHTS FOR SOME MINUTES, FANNY,
FEELING IT DUE TO HERSELF, RETURNED TO MR. CRAWFORD, AND SAID, "IT
IS NOT MERELY IN TEMPER THAT I CONSIDER HIM AS TOTALLY UNSUITED TO
MYSELF; THOUGH, IN THAT RESPECT, I THINK THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN US TOO
GREAT, INFINITELY TOO GREAT: HIS SPIRITS OFTEN OPPRESS ME; BUT THERE IS
SOMETHING IN HIM WHICH I OBJECT TO STILL MORE. I MUST SAY, COUSIN, THAT
I CANNOT APPROVE HIS CHARACTER. I HAVE NOT THOUGHT WELL OF HIM FROM THE
TIME OF THE PLAY. I THEN SAW HIM BEHAVING, AS IT APPEARED TO ME, SO
VERY IMPROPERLY AND UNFEELINGLY--I MAY SPEAK OF IT NOW BECAUSE IT IS ALL
OVER--SO IMPROPERLY BY POOR MR. RUSHWORTH, NOT SEEMING TO CARE HOW HE
EXPOSED OR HURT HIM, AND PAYING ATTENTIONS TO MY COUSIN MARIA, WHICH--IN
SHORT, AT THE TIME OF THE PLAY, I RECEIVED AN IMPRESSION WHICH WILL
NEVER BE GOT OVER."

"MY DEAR FANNY," REPLIED EDMUND, SCARCELY HEARING HER TO THE END, "LET
US NOT, ANY OF US, BE JUDGED BY WHAT WE APPEARED AT THAT PERIOD OF
GENERAL FOLLY. THE TIME OF THE PLAY IS A TIME WHICH I HATE TO RECOLLECT.
MARIA WAS WRONG, CRAWFORD WAS WRONG, WE WERE ALL WRONG TOGETHER; BUT
NONE SO WRONG AS MYSELF. COMPARED WITH ME, ALL THE REST WERE BLAMELESS.
I WAS PLAYING THE FOOL WITH MY EYES OPEN."

"AS A BYSTANDER," SAID FANNY, "PERHAPS I SAW MORE THAN YOU DID; AND I DO
THINK THAT MR. RUSHWORTH WAS SOMETIMES VERY JEALOUS."

"VERY POSSIBLY. NO WONDER. NOTHING COULD BE MORE IMPROPER THAN THE WHOLE
BUSINESS. I AM SHOCKED WHENEVER I THINK THAT MARIA COULD BE CAPABLE OF
IT; BUT, IF SHE COULD UNDERTAKE THE PART, WE MUST NOT BE SURPRISED AT
THE REST."

"BEFORE THE PLAY, I AM MUCH MISTAKEN IF JULIA DID NOT THINK HE WAS
PAYING HER ATTENTIONS."

"JULIA! I HAVE HEARD BEFORE FROM SOME ONE OF HIS BEING IN LOVE WITH
JULIA; BUT I COULD NEVER SEE ANYTHING OF IT. AND, FANNY, THOUGH I HOPE I
DO JUSTICE TO MY SISTERS' GOOD QUALITIES, I THINK IT VERY POSSIBLE THAT
THEY MIGHT, ONE OR BOTH, BE MORE DESIROUS OF BEING ADMIRED BY CRAWFORD,
AND MIGHT SHEW THAT DESIRE RATHER MORE UNGUARDEDLY THAN WAS PERFECTLY
PRUDENT. I CAN REMEMBER THAT THEY WERE EVIDENTLY FOND OF HIS SOCIETY;
AND WITH SUCH ENCOURAGEMENT, A MAN LIKE CRAWFORD, LIVELY, AND IT MAY
BE, A LITTLE UNTHINKING, MIGHT BE LED ON TO--THERE COULD BE NOTHING VERY
STRIKING, BECAUSE IT IS CLEAR THAT HE HAD NO PRETENSIONS: HIS HEART WAS
RESERVED FOR YOU. AND I MUST SAY, THAT ITS BEING FOR YOU HAS RAISED HIM
INCONCEIVABLY IN MY OPINION. IT DOES HIM THE HIGHEST HONOUR; IT SHEWS
HIS PROPER ESTIMATION OF THE BLESSING OF DOMESTIC HAPPINESS AND PURE
ATTACHMENT. IT PROVES HIM UNSPOILT BY HIS UNCLE. IT PROVES HIM, IN
SHORT, EVERYTHING THAT I HAD BEEN USED TO WISH TO BELIEVE HIM, AND
FEARED HE WAS NOT."

"I AM PERSUADED THAT HE DOES NOT THINK, AS HE OUGHT, ON SERIOUS
SUBJECTS."

"SAY, RATHER, THAT HE HAS NOT THOUGHT AT ALL UPON SERIOUS SUBJECTS,
WHICH I BELIEVE TO BE A GOOD DEAL THE CASE. HOW COULD IT BE OTHERWISE,
WITH SUCH AN EDUCATION AND ADVISER? UNDER THE DISADVANTAGES, INDEED,
WHICH BOTH HAVE HAD, IS IT NOT WONDERFUL THAT THEY SHOULD BE WHAT THEY
ARE? CRAWFORD'S FEELINGS, I AM READY TO ACKNOWLEDGE, HAVE HITHERTO
BEEN TOO MUCH HIS GUIDES. HAPPILY, THOSE FEELINGS HAVE GENERALLY BEEN
GOOD. YOU WILL SUPPLY THE REST; AND A MOST FORTUNATE MAN HE IS TO ATTACH
HIMSELF TO SUCH A CREATURE--TO A WOMAN WHO, FIRM AS A ROCK IN HER OWN
PRINCIPLES, HAS A GENTLENESS OF CHARACTER SO WELL ADAPTED TO RECOMMEND
THEM. HE HAS CHOSEN HIS PARTNER, INDEED, WITH RARE FELICITY. HE WILL
MAKE YOU HAPPY, FANNY; I KNOW HE WILL MAKE YOU HAPPY; BUT YOU WILL MAKE
HIM EVERYTHING."

"I WOULD NOT ENGAGE IN SUCH A CHARGE," CRIED FANNY, IN A SHRINKING
ACCENT; "IN SUCH AN OFFICE OF HIGH RESPONSIBILITY!"

"AS USUAL, BELIEVING YOURSELF UNEQUAL TO ANYTHING! FANCYING EVERYTHING
TOO MUCH FOR YOU! WELL, THOUGH I MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PERSUADE YOU INTO
DIFFERENT FEELINGS, YOU WILL BE PERSUADED INTO THEM, I TRUST. I CONFESS
MYSELF SINCERELY ANXIOUS THAT YOU MAY. I HAVE NO COMMON INTEREST IN
CRAWFORD'S WELL-DOING. NEXT TO YOUR HAPPINESS, FANNY, HIS HAS THE FIRST
CLAIM ON ME. YOU ARE AWARE OF MY HAVING NO COMMON INTEREST IN CRAWFORD."

FANNY WAS TOO WELL AWARE OF IT TO HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY; AND THEY WALKED
ON TOGETHER SOME FIFTY YARDS IN MUTUAL SILENCE AND ABSTRACTION. EDMUND
FIRST BEGAN AGAIN--

"I WAS VERY MUCH PLEASED BY HER MANNER OF SPEAKING OF IT YESTERDAY,
PARTICULARLY PLEASED, BECAUSE I HAD NOT DEPENDED UPON HER SEEING
EVERYTHING IN SO JUST A LIGHT. I KNEW SHE WAS VERY FOND OF YOU; BUT YET
I WAS AFRAID OF HER NOT ESTIMATING YOUR WORTH TO HER BROTHER QUITE AS
IT DESERVED, AND OF HER REGRETTING THAT HE HAD NOT RATHER FIXED ON
SOME WOMAN OF DISTINCTION OR FORTUNE. I WAS AFRAID OF THE BIAS OF THOSE
WORLDLY MAXIMS, WHICH SHE HAS BEEN TOO MUCH USED TO HEAR. BUT IT WAS
VERY DIFFERENT. SHE SPOKE OF YOU, FANNY, JUST AS SHE OUGHT. SHE DESIRES
THE CONNEXION AS WARMLY AS YOUR UNCLE OR MYSELF. WE HAD A LONG TALK
ABOUT IT. I SHOULD NOT HAVE MENTIONED THE SUBJECT, THOUGH VERY ANXIOUS
TO KNOW HER SENTIMENTS; BUT I HAD NOT BEEN IN THE ROOM FIVE MINUTES
BEFORE SHE BEGAN INTRODUCING IT WITH ALL THAT OPENNESS OF HEART, AND
SWEET PECULIARITY OF MANNER, THAT SPIRIT AND INGENUOUSNESS WHICH ARE SO
MUCH A PART OF HERSELF. MRS. GRANT LAUGHED AT HER FOR HER RAPIDITY."

"WAS MRS. GRANT IN THE ROOM, THEN?"

"YES, WHEN I REACHED THE HOUSE I FOUND THE TWO SISTERS TOGETHER BY
THEMSELVES; AND WHEN ONCE WE HAD BEGUN, WE HAD NOT DONE WITH YOU, FANNY,
TILL CRAWFORD AND DR. GRANT CAME IN."

"IT IS ABOVE A WEEK SINCE I SAW MISS CRAWFORD."

"YES, SHE LAMENTS IT; YET OWNS IT MAY HAVE BEEN BEST. YOU WILL SEE HER,
HOWEVER, BEFORE SHE GOES. SHE IS VERY ANGRY WITH YOU, FANNY; YOU MUST BE
PREPARED FOR THAT. SHE CALLS HERSELF VERY ANGRY, BUT YOU CAN IMAGINE HER
ANGER. IT IS THE REGRET AND DISAPPOINTMENT OF A SISTER, WHO THINKS HER
BROTHER HAS A RIGHT TO EVERYTHING HE MAY WISH FOR, AT THE FIRST MOMENT.
SHE IS HURT, AS YOU WOULD BE FOR WILLIAM; BUT SHE LOVES AND ESTEEMS YOU
WITH ALL HER HEART."

"I KNEW SHE WOULD BE VERY ANGRY WITH ME."

"MY DEAREST FANNY," CRIED EDMUND, PRESSING HER ARM CLOSER TO HIM, "DO
NOT LET THE IDEA OF HER ANGER DISTRESS YOU. IT IS ANGER TO BE TALKED
OF RATHER THAN FELT. HER HEART IS MADE FOR LOVE AND KINDNESS, NOT FOR
RESENTMENT. I WISH YOU COULD HAVE OVERHEARD HER TRIBUTE OF PRAISE;
I WISH YOU COULD HAVE SEEN HER COUNTENANCE, WHEN SHE SAID THAT YOU
SHOULD BE HENRY'S WIFE. AND I OBSERVED THAT SHE ALWAYS SPOKE OF YOU
AS 'FANNY,' WHICH SHE WAS NEVER USED TO DO; AND IT HAD A SOUND OF MOST
SISTERLY CORDIALITY."

"AND MRS. GRANT, DID SHE SAY--DID SHE SPEAK; WAS SHE THERE ALL THE
TIME?"

"YES, SHE WAS AGREEING EXACTLY WITH HER SISTER. THE SURPRISE OF YOUR
REFUSAL, FANNY, SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN UNBOUNDED. THAT YOU COULD REFUSE SUCH
A MAN AS HENRY CRAWFORD SEEMS MORE THAN THEY CAN UNDERSTAND. I SAID WHAT
I COULD FOR YOU; BUT IN GOOD TRUTH, AS THEY STATED THE CASE--YOU MUST
PROVE YOURSELF TO BE IN YOUR SENSES AS SOON AS YOU CAN BY A DIFFERENT
CONDUCT; NOTHING ELSE WILL SATISFY THEM. BUT THIS IS TEASING YOU. I HAVE
DONE. DO NOT TURN AWAY FROM ME."

"I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT," SAID FANNY, AFTER A PAUSE OF RECOLLECTION AND
EXERTION, "THAT EVERY WOMAN MUST HAVE FELT THE POSSIBILITY OF A MAN'S
NOT BEING APPROVED, NOT BEING LOVED BY SOME ONE OF HER SEX AT LEAST, LET
HIM BE EVER SO GENERALLY AGREEABLE. LET HIM HAVE ALL THE PERFECTIONS
IN THE WORLD, I THINK IT OUGHT NOT TO BE SET DOWN AS CERTAIN THAT A MAN
MUST BE ACCEPTABLE TO EVERY WOMAN HE MAY HAPPEN TO LIKE HIMSELF. BUT,
EVEN SUPPOSING IT IS SO, ALLOWING MR. CRAWFORD TO HAVE ALL THE CLAIMS
WHICH HIS SISTERS THINK HE HAS, HOW WAS I TO BE PREPARED TO MEET HIM
WITH ANY FEELING ANSWERABLE TO HIS OWN? HE TOOK ME WHOLLY BY SURPRISE.
I HAD NOT AN IDEA THAT HIS BEHAVIOUR TO ME BEFORE HAD ANY MEANING; AND
SURELY I WAS NOT TO BE TEACHING MYSELF TO LIKE HIM ONLY BECAUSE HE WAS
TAKING WHAT SEEMED VERY IDLE NOTICE OF ME. IN MY SITUATION, IT WOULD
HAVE BEEN THE EXTREME OF VANITY TO BE FORMING EXPECTATIONS ON MR.
CRAWFORD. I AM SURE HIS SISTERS, RATING HIM AS THEY DO, MUST HAVE
THOUGHT IT SO, SUPPOSING HE HAD MEANT NOTHING. HOW, THEN, WAS I TO
BE--TO BE IN LOVE WITH HIM THE MOMENT HE SAID HE WAS WITH ME? HOW WAS I
TO HAVE AN ATTACHMENT AT HIS SERVICE, AS SOON AS IT WAS ASKED FOR? HIS
SISTERS SHOULD CONSIDER ME AS WELL AS HIM. THE HIGHER HIS DESERTS, THE
MORE IMPROPER FOR ME EVER TO HAVE THOUGHT OF HIM. AND, AND--WE THINK
VERY DIFFERENTLY OF THE NATURE OF WOMEN, IF THEY CAN IMAGINE A WOMAN SO
VERY SOON CAPABLE OF RETURNING AN AFFECTION AS THIS SEEMS TO IMPLY."

"MY DEAR, DEAR FANNY, NOW I HAVE THE TRUTH. I KNOW THIS TO BE THE TRUTH;
AND MOST WORTHY OF YOU ARE SUCH FEELINGS. I HAD ATTRIBUTED THEM TO YOU
BEFORE. I THOUGHT I COULD UNDERSTAND YOU. YOU HAVE NOW GIVEN EXACTLY
THE EXPLANATION WHICH I VENTURED TO MAKE FOR YOU TO YOUR FRIEND AND MRS.
GRANT, AND THEY WERE BOTH BETTER SATISFIED, THOUGH YOUR WARM-HEARTED
FRIEND WAS STILL RUN AWAY WITH A LITTLE BY THE ENTHUSIASM OF HER
FONDNESS FOR HENRY. I TOLD THEM THAT YOU WERE OF ALL HUMAN CREATURES THE
ONE OVER WHOM HABIT HAD MOST POWER AND NOVELTY LEAST; AND THAT THE VERY
CIRCUMSTANCE OF THE NOVELTY OF CRAWFORD'S ADDRESSES WAS AGAINST HIM.
THEIR BEING SO NEW AND SO RECENT WAS ALL IN THEIR DISFAVOUR; THAT YOU
COULD TOLERATE NOTHING THAT YOU WERE NOT USED TO; AND A GREAT DEAL MORE
TO THE SAME PURPOSE, TO GIVE THEM A KNOWLEDGE OF YOUR CHARACTER. MISS
CRAWFORD MADE US LAUGH BY HER PLANS OF ENCOURAGEMENT FOR HER BROTHER.
SHE MEANT TO URGE HIM TO PERSEVERE IN THE HOPE OF BEING LOVED IN TIME,
AND OF HAVING HIS ADDRESSES MOST KINDLY RECEIVED AT THE END OF ABOUT TEN
YEARS' HAPPY MARRIAGE."

FANNY COULD WITH DIFFICULTY GIVE THE SMILE THAT WAS HERE ASKED FOR. HER
FEELINGS WERE ALL IN REVOLT. SHE FEARED SHE HAD BEEN DOING WRONG: SAYING
TOO MUCH, OVERACTING THE CAUTION WHICH SHE HAD BEEN FANCYING NECESSARY;
IN GUARDING AGAINST ONE EVIL, LAYING HERSELF OPEN TO ANOTHER; AND TO
HAVE MISS CRAWFORD'S LIVELINESS REPEATED TO HER AT SUCH A MOMENT, AND ON
SUCH A SUBJECT, WAS A BITTER AGGRAVATION.

EDMUND SAW WEARINESS AND DISTRESS IN HER FACE, AND IMMEDIATELY RESOLVED
TO FORBEAR ALL FARTHER DISCUSSION; AND NOT EVEN TO MENTION THE NAME
OF CRAWFORD AGAIN, EXCEPT AS IT MIGHT BE CONNECTED WITH WHAT MUST BE
AGREEABLE TO HER. ON THIS PRINCIPLE, HE SOON AFTERWARDS OBSERVED--"THEY
GO ON MONDAY. YOU ARE SURE, THEREFORE, OF SEEING YOUR FRIEND EITHER
TO-MORROW OR SUNDAY. THEY REALLY GO ON MONDAY; AND I WAS WITHIN A TRIFLE
OF BEING PERSUADED TO STAY AT LESSINGBY TILL THAT VERY DAY! I HAD ALMOST
PROMISED IT. WHAT A DIFFERENCE IT MIGHT HAVE MADE! THOSE FIVE OR SIX
DAYS MORE AT LESSINGBY MIGHT HAVE BEEN FELT ALL MY LIFE."

"YOU WERE NEAR STAYING THERE?"

"VERY. I WAS MOST KINDLY PRESSED, AND HAD NEARLY CONSENTED. HAD I
RECEIVED ANY LETTER FROM MANSFIELD, TO TELL ME HOW YOU WERE ALL GOING
ON, I BELIEVE I SHOULD CERTAINLY HAVE STAID; BUT I KNEW NOTHING THAT
HAD HAPPENED HERE FOR A FORTNIGHT, AND FELT THAT I HAD BEEN AWAY LONG
ENOUGH."

"YOU SPENT YOUR TIME PLEASANTLY THERE?"

"YES; THAT IS, IT WAS THE FAULT OF MY OWN MIND IF I DID NOT. THEY WERE
ALL VERY PLEASANT. I DOUBT THEIR FINDING ME SO. I TOOK UNEASINESS WITH
ME, AND THERE WAS NO GETTING RID OF IT TILL I WAS IN MANSFIELD AGAIN."

"THE MISS OWENS--YOU LIKED THEM, DID NOT YOU?"

"YES, VERY WELL. PLEASANT, GOOD-HUMOURED, UNAFFECTED GIRLS. BUT I AM
SPOILT, FANNY, FOR COMMON FEMALE SOCIETY. GOOD-HUMOURED, UNAFFECTED
GIRLS WILL NOT DO FOR A MAN WHO HAS BEEN USED TO SENSIBLE WOMEN. THEY
ARE TWO DISTINCT ORDERS OF BEING. YOU AND MISS CRAWFORD HAVE MADE ME TOO
NICE."

STILL, HOWEVER, FANNY WAS OPPRESSED AND WEARIED; HE SAW IT IN HER LOOKS,
IT COULD NOT BE TALKED AWAY; AND ATTEMPTING IT NO MORE, HE LED HER
DIRECTLY, WITH THE KIND AUTHORITY OF A PRIVILEGED GUARDIAN, INTO THE
HOUSE.



CHAPTER XXXVI

EDMUND NOW BELIEVED HIMSELF PERFECTLY ACQUAINTED WITH ALL THAT FANNY
COULD TELL, OR COULD LEAVE TO BE CONJECTURED OF HER SENTIMENTS, AND HE
WAS SATISFIED. IT HAD BEEN, AS HE BEFORE PRESUMED, TOO HASTY A MEASURE
ON CRAWFORD'S SIDE, AND TIME MUST BE GIVEN TO MAKE THE IDEA FIRST
FAMILIAR, AND THEN AGREEABLE TO HER. SHE MUST BE USED TO THE
CONSIDERATION OF HIS BEING IN LOVE WITH HER, AND THEN A RETURN OF
AFFECTION MIGHT NOT BE VERY DISTANT.

HE GAVE THIS OPINION AS THE RESULT OF THE CONVERSATION TO HIS FATHER;
AND RECOMMENDED THERE BEING NOTHING MORE SAID TO HER: NO FARTHER
ATTEMPTS TO INFLUENCE OR PERSUADE; BUT THAT EVERYTHING SHOULD BE LEFT TO
CRAWFORD'S ASSIDUITIES, AND THE NATURAL WORKINGS OF HER OWN MIND.

SIR THOMAS PROMISED THAT IT SHOULD BE SO. EDMUND'S ACCOUNT OF FANNY'S
DISPOSITION HE COULD BELIEVE TO BE JUST; HE SUPPOSED SHE HAD ALL THOSE
FEELINGS, BUT HE MUST CONSIDER IT AS VERY UNFORTUNATE THAT SHE HAD;
FOR, LESS WILLING THAN HIS SON TO TRUST TO THE FUTURE, HE COULD NOT
HELP FEARING THAT IF SUCH VERY LONG ALLOWANCES OF TIME AND HABIT WERE
NECESSARY FOR HER, SHE MIGHT NOT HAVE PERSUADED HERSELF INTO RECEIVING
HIS ADDRESSES PROPERLY BEFORE THE YOUNG MAN'S INCLINATION FOR PAYING
THEM WERE OVER. THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE DONE, HOWEVER, BUT TO SUBMIT
QUIETLY AND HOPE THE BEST.

THE PROMISED VISIT FROM "HER FRIEND," AS EDMUND CALLED MISS CRAWFORD,
WAS A FORMIDABLE THREAT TO FANNY, AND SHE LIVED IN CONTINUAL TERROR OF
IT. AS A SISTER, SO PARTIAL AND SO ANGRY, AND SO LITTLE SCRUPULOUS OF
WHAT SHE SAID, AND IN ANOTHER LIGHT SO TRIUMPHANT AND SECURE, SHE WAS IN
EVERY WAY AN OBJECT OF PAINFUL ALARM. HER DISPLEASURE, HER PENETRATION,
AND HER HAPPINESS WERE ALL FEARFUL TO ENCOUNTER; AND THE DEPENDENCE OF
HAVING OTHERS PRESENT WHEN THEY MET WAS FANNY'S ONLY SUPPORT IN LOOKING
FORWARD TO IT. SHE ABSENTED HERSELF AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE FROM LADY
BERTRAM, KEPT AWAY FROM THE EAST ROOM, AND TOOK NO SOLITARY WALK IN THE
SHRUBBERY, IN HER CAUTION TO AVOID ANY SUDDEN ATTACK.

SHE SUCCEEDED. SHE WAS SAFE IN THE BREAKFAST-ROOM, WITH HER AUNT, WHEN
MISS CRAWFORD DID COME; AND THE FIRST MISERY OVER, AND MISS CRAWFORD
LOOKING AND SPEAKING WITH MUCH LESS PARTICULARITY OF EXPRESSION THAN SHE
HAD ANTICIPATED, FANNY BEGAN TO HOPE THERE WOULD BE NOTHING WORSE TO BE
ENDURED THAN A HALF-HOUR OF MODERATE AGITATION. BUT HERE SHE HOPED TOO
MUCH; MISS CRAWFORD WAS NOT THE SLAVE OF OPPORTUNITY. SHE WAS DETERMINED
TO SEE FANNY ALONE, AND THEREFORE SAID TO HER TOLERABLY SOON, IN A LOW
VOICE, "I MUST SPEAK TO YOU FOR A FEW MINUTES SOMEWHERE"; WORDS THAT
FANNY FELT ALL OVER HER, IN ALL HER PULSES AND ALL HER NERVES. DENIAL
WAS IMPOSSIBLE. HER HABITS OF READY SUBMISSION, ON THE CONTRARY, MADE
HER ALMOST INSTANTLY RISE AND LEAD THE WAY OUT OF THE ROOM. SHE DID IT
WITH WRETCHED FEELINGS, BUT IT WAS INEVITABLE.

THEY WERE NO SOONER IN THE HALL THAN ALL RESTRAINT OF COUNTENANCE WAS
OVER ON MISS CRAWFORD'S SIDE. SHE IMMEDIATELY SHOOK HER HEAD AT FANNY
WITH ARCH, YET AFFECTIONATE REPROACH, AND TAKING HER HAND, SEEMED HARDLY
ABLE TO HELP BEGINNING DIRECTLY. SHE SAID NOTHING, HOWEVER, BUT, "SAD,
SAD GIRL! I DO NOT KNOW WHEN I SHALL HAVE DONE SCOLDING YOU," AND HAD
DISCRETION ENOUGH TO RESERVE THE REST TILL THEY MIGHT BE SECURE OF
HAVING FOUR WALLS TO THEMSELVES. FANNY NATURALLY TURNED UPSTAIRS, AND
TOOK HER GUEST TO THE APARTMENT WHICH WAS NOW ALWAYS FIT FOR COMFORTABLE
USE; OPENING THE DOOR, HOWEVER, WITH A MOST ACHING HEART, AND FEELING
THAT SHE HAD A MORE DISTRESSING SCENE BEFORE HER THAN EVER THAT SPOT HAD
YET WITNESSED. BUT THE EVIL READY TO BURST ON HER WAS AT LEAST DELAYED
BY THE SUDDEN CHANGE IN MISS CRAWFORD'S IDEAS; BY THE STRONG EFFECT ON
HER MIND WHICH THE FINDING HERSELF IN THE EAST ROOM AGAIN PRODUCED.

"HA!" SHE CRIED, WITH INSTANT ANIMATION, "AM I HERE AGAIN? THE EAST
ROOM! ONCE ONLY WAS I IN THIS ROOM BEFORE"; AND AFTER STOPPING TO LOOK
ABOUT HER, AND SEEMINGLY TO RETRACE ALL THAT HAD THEN PASSED, SHE ADDED,
"ONCE ONLY BEFORE. DO YOU REMEMBER IT? I CAME TO REHEARSE. YOUR COUSIN
CAME TOO; AND WE HAD A REHEARSAL. YOU WERE OUR AUDIENCE AND PROMPTER.
A DELIGHTFUL REHEARSAL. I SHALL NEVER FORGET IT. HERE WE WERE, JUST IN
THIS PART OF THE ROOM: HERE WAS YOUR COUSIN, HERE WAS I, HERE WERE THE
CHAIRS. OH! WHY WILL SUCH THINGS EVER PASS AWAY?"

HAPPILY FOR HER COMPANION, SHE WANTED NO ANSWER. HER MIND WAS ENTIRELY
SELF-ENGROSSED. SHE WAS IN A REVERIE OF SWEET REMEMBRANCES.

"THE SCENE WE WERE REHEARSING WAS SO VERY REMARKABLE! THE SUBJECT OF
IT SO VERY--VERY--WHAT SHALL I SAY? HE WAS TO BE DESCRIBING AND
RECOMMENDING MATRIMONY TO ME. I THINK I SEE HIM NOW, TRYING TO BE AS
DEMURE AND COMPOSED AS ANHALT OUGHT, THROUGH THE TWO LONG SPEECHES.
'WHEN TWO SYMPATHETIC HEARTS MEET IN THE MARRIAGE STATE, MATRIMONY
MAY BE CALLED A HAPPY LIFE.' I SUPPOSE NO TIME CAN EVER WEAR OUT THE
IMPRESSION I HAVE OF HIS LOOKS AND VOICE AS HE SAID THOSE WORDS. IT WAS
CURIOUS, VERY CURIOUS, THAT WE SHOULD HAVE SUCH A SCENE TO PLAY! IF I
HAD THE POWER OF RECALLING ANY ONE WEEK OF MY EXISTENCE, IT SHOULD BE
THAT WEEK--THAT ACTING WEEK. SAY WHAT YOU WOULD, FANNY, IT SHOULD BE
THAT; FOR I NEVER KNEW SUCH EXQUISITE HAPPINESS IN ANY OTHER. HIS
STURDY SPIRIT TO BEND AS IT DID! OH! IT WAS SWEET BEYOND EXPRESSION. BUT
ALAS, THAT VERY EVENING DESTROYED IT ALL. THAT VERY EVENING BROUGHT YOUR
MOST UNWELCOME UNCLE. POOR SIR THOMAS, WHO WAS GLAD TO SEE YOU? YET,
FANNY, DO NOT IMAGINE I WOULD NOW SPEAK DISRESPECTFULLY OF SIR THOMAS,
THOUGH I CERTAINLY DID HATE HIM FOR MANY A WEEK. NO, I DO HIM JUSTICE
NOW. HE IS JUST WHAT THE HEAD OF SUCH A FAMILY SHOULD BE. NAY, IN SOBER
SADNESS, I BELIEVE I NOW LOVE YOU ALL." AND HAVING SAID SO, WITH A
DEGREE OF TENDERNESS AND CONSCIOUSNESS WHICH FANNY HAD NEVER SEEN IN HER
BEFORE, AND NOW THOUGHT ONLY TOO BECOMING, SHE TURNED AWAY FOR A MOMENT
TO RECOVER HERSELF. "I HAVE HAD A LITTLE FIT SINCE I CAME INTO THIS
ROOM, AS YOU MAY PERCEIVE," SAID SHE PRESENTLY, WITH A PLAYFUL SMILE,
"BUT IT IS OVER NOW; SO LET US SIT DOWN AND BE COMFORTABLE; FOR AS TO
SCOLDING YOU, FANNY, WHICH I CAME FULLY INTENDING TO DO, I HAVE NOT
THE HEART FOR IT WHEN IT COMES TO THE POINT." AND EMBRACING HER VERY
AFFECTIONATELY, "GOOD, GENTLE FANNY! WHEN I THINK OF THIS BEING THE
LAST TIME OF SEEING YOU FOR I DO NOT KNOW HOW LONG, I FEEL IT QUITE
IMPOSSIBLE TO DO ANYTHING BUT LOVE YOU."

FANNY WAS AFFECTED. SHE HAD NOT FORESEEN ANYTHING OF THIS, AND HER
FEELINGS COULD SELDOM WITHSTAND THE MELANCHOLY INFLUENCE OF THE WORD
"LAST." SHE CRIED AS IF SHE HAD LOVED MISS CRAWFORD MORE THAN SHE
POSSIBLY COULD; AND MISS CRAWFORD, YET FARTHER SOFTENED BY THE SIGHT OF
SUCH EMOTION, HUNG ABOUT HER WITH FONDNESS, AND SAID, "I HATE TO LEAVE
YOU. I SHALL SEE NO ONE HALF SO AMIABLE WHERE I AM GOING. WHO SAYS WE
SHALL NOT BE SISTERS? I KNOW WE SHALL. I FEEL THAT WE ARE BORN TO
BE CONNECTED; AND THOSE TEARS CONVINCE ME THAT YOU FEEL IT TOO, DEAR
FANNY."

FANNY ROUSED HERSELF, AND REPLYING ONLY IN PART, SAID, "BUT YOU ARE
ONLY GOING FROM ONE SET OF FRIENDS TO ANOTHER. YOU ARE GOING TO A VERY
PARTICULAR FRIEND."

"YES, VERY TRUE. MRS. FRASER HAS BEEN MY INTIMATE FRIEND FOR YEARS. BUT
I HAVE NOT THE LEAST INCLINATION TO GO NEAR HER. I CAN THINK ONLY OF THE
FRIENDS I AM LEAVING: MY EXCELLENT SISTER, YOURSELF, AND THE BERTRAMS IN
GENERAL. YOU HAVE ALL SO MUCH MORE HEART AMONG YOU THAN ONE FINDS IN
THE WORLD AT LARGE. YOU ALL GIVE ME A FEELING OF BEING ABLE TO TRUST AND
CONFIDE IN YOU, WHICH IN COMMON INTERCOURSE ONE KNOWS NOTHING OF. I WISH
I HAD SETTLED WITH MRS. FRASER NOT TO GO TO HER TILL AFTER EASTER, A
MUCH BETTER TIME FOR THE VISIT, BUT NOW I CANNOT PUT HER OFF. AND WHEN
I HAVE DONE WITH HER I MUST GO TO HER SISTER, LADY STORNAWAY, BECAUSE
SHE WAS RATHER MY MOST PARTICULAR FRIEND OF THE TWO, BUT I HAVE NOT
CARED MUCH FOR HER THESE THREE YEARS."

AFTER THIS SPEECH THE TWO GIRLS SAT MANY MINUTES SILENT, EACH
THOUGHTFUL: FANNY MEDITATING ON THE DIFFERENT SORTS OF FRIENDSHIP IN THE
WORLD, MARY ON SOMETHING OF LESS PHILOSOPHIC TENDENCY. SHE FIRST SPOKE
AGAIN.

"HOW PERFECTLY I REMEMBER MY RESOLVING TO LOOK FOR YOU UPSTAIRS, AND
SETTING OFF TO FIND MY WAY TO THE EAST ROOM, WITHOUT HAVING AN IDEA
WHEREABOUTS IT WAS! HOW WELL I REMEMBER WHAT I WAS THINKING OF AS I CAME
ALONG, AND MY LOOKING IN AND SEEING YOU HERE SITTING AT THIS TABLE AT
WORK; AND THEN YOUR COUSIN'S ASTONISHMENT, WHEN HE OPENED THE DOOR, AT
SEEING ME HERE! TO BE SURE, YOUR UNCLE'S RETURNING THAT VERY EVENING!
THERE NEVER WAS ANYTHING QUITE LIKE IT."

ANOTHER SHORT FIT OF ABSTRACTION FOLLOWED, WHEN, SHAKING IT OFF, SHE
THUS ATTACKED HER COMPANION.

"WHY, FANNY, YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY IN A REVERIE. THINKING, I HOPE, OF ONE
WHO IS ALWAYS THINKING OF YOU. OH! THAT I COULD TRANSPORT YOU FOR A
SHORT TIME INTO OUR CIRCLE IN TOWN, THAT YOU MIGHT UNDERSTAND HOW YOUR
POWER OVER HENRY IS THOUGHT OF THERE! OH! THE ENVYINGS AND HEARTBURNINGS
OF DOZENS AND DOZENS; THE WONDER, THE INCREDULITY THAT WILL BE FELT AT
HEARING WHAT YOU HAVE DONE! FOR AS TO SECRECY, HENRY IS QUITE THE HERO
OF AN OLD ROMANCE, AND GLORIES IN HIS CHAINS. YOU SHOULD COME TO LONDON
TO KNOW HOW TO ESTIMATE YOUR CONQUEST. IF YOU WERE TO SEE HOW HE IS
COURTED, AND HOW I AM COURTED FOR HIS SAKE! NOW, I AM WELL AWARE THAT
I SHALL NOT BE HALF SO WELCOME TO MRS. FRASER IN CONSEQUENCE OF HIS
SITUATION WITH YOU. WHEN SHE COMES TO KNOW THE TRUTH SHE WILL, VERY
LIKELY, WISH ME IN NORTHAMPTONSHIRE AGAIN; FOR THERE IS A DAUGHTER OF
MR. FRASER, BY A FIRST WIFE, WHOM SHE IS WILD TO GET MARRIED, AND
WANTS HENRY TO TAKE. OH! SHE HAS BEEN TRYING FOR HIM TO SUCH A DEGREE.
INNOCENT AND QUIET AS YOU SIT HERE, YOU CANNOT HAVE AN IDEA OF THE
SENSATION THAT YOU WILL BE OCCASIONING, OF THE CURIOSITY THERE WILL
BE TO SEE YOU, OF THE ENDLESS QUESTIONS I SHALL HAVE TO ANSWER! POOR
MARGARET FRASER WILL BE AT ME FOR EVER ABOUT YOUR EYES AND YOUR TEETH,
AND HOW YOU DO YOUR HAIR, AND WHO MAKES YOUR SHOES. I WISH MARGARET WERE
MARRIED, FOR MY POOR FRIEND'S SAKE, FOR I LOOK UPON THE FRASERS TO BE
ABOUT AS UNHAPPY AS MOST OTHER MARRIED PEOPLE. AND YET IT WAS A MOST
DESIRABLE MATCH FOR JANET AT THE TIME. WE WERE ALL DELIGHTED. SHE COULD
NOT DO OTHERWISE THAN ACCEPT HIM, FOR HE WAS RICH, AND SHE HAD NOTHING;
BUT HE TURNS OUT ILL-TEMPERED AND EXIGEANT, AND WANTS A YOUNG WOMAN,
A BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN OF FIVE-AND-TWENTY, TO BE AS STEADY AS HIMSELF.
AND MY FRIEND DOES NOT MANAGE HIM WELL; SHE DOES NOT SEEM TO KNOW HOW
TO MAKE THE BEST OF IT. THERE IS A SPIRIT OF IRRITATION WHICH, TO SAY
NOTHING WORSE, IS CERTAINLY VERY ILL-BRED. IN THEIR HOUSE I SHALL CALL
TO MIND THE CONJUGAL MANNERS OF MANSFIELD PARSONAGE WITH RESPECT. EVEN
DR. GRANT DOES SHEW A THOROUGH CONFIDENCE IN MY SISTER, AND A CERTAIN
CONSIDERATION FOR HER JUDGMENT, WHICH MAKES ONE FEEL THERE IS
ATTACHMENT; BUT OF THAT I SHALL SEE NOTHING WITH THE FRASERS. I SHALL
BE AT MANSFIELD FOR EVER, FANNY. MY OWN SISTER AS A WIFE, SIR THOMAS
BERTRAM AS A HUSBAND, ARE MY STANDARDS OF PERFECTION. POOR JANET HAS
BEEN SADLY TAKEN IN, AND YET THERE WAS NOTHING IMPROPER ON HER SIDE:
SHE DID NOT RUN INTO THE MATCH INCONSIDERATELY; THERE WAS NO WANT OF
FORESIGHT. SHE TOOK THREE DAYS TO CONSIDER OF HIS PROPOSALS, AND DURING
THOSE THREE DAYS ASKED THE ADVICE OF EVERYBODY CONNECTED WITH HER WHOSE
OPINION WAS WORTH HAVING, AND ESPECIALLY APPLIED TO MY LATE DEAR AUNT,
WHOSE KNOWLEDGE OF THE WORLD MADE HER JUDGMENT VERY GENERALLY AND
DESERVEDLY LOOKED UP TO BY ALL THE YOUNG PEOPLE OF HER ACQUAINTANCE, AND
SHE WAS DECIDEDLY IN FAVOUR OF MR. FRASER. THIS SEEMS AS IF NOTHING WERE
A SECURITY FOR MATRIMONIAL COMFORT. I HAVE NOT SO MUCH TO SAY FOR MY
FRIEND FLORA, WHO JILTED A VERY NICE YOUNG MAN IN THE BLUES FOR THE SAKE
OF THAT HORRID LORD STORNAWAY, WHO HAS ABOUT AS MUCH SENSE, FANNY, AS
MR. RUSHWORTH, BUT MUCH WORSE-LOOKING, AND WITH A BLACKGUARD CHARACTER.
I HAD MY DOUBTS AT THE TIME ABOUT HER BEING RIGHT, FOR HE HAS NOT EVEN
THE AIR OF A GENTLEMAN, AND NOW I AM SURE SHE WAS WRONG. BY THE BYE,
FLORA ROSS WAS DYING FOR HENRY THE FIRST WINTER SHE CAME OUT. BUT WERE I
TO ATTEMPT TO TELL YOU OF ALL THE WOMEN WHOM I HAVE KNOWN TO BE IN LOVE
WITH HIM, I SHOULD NEVER HAVE DONE. IT IS YOU, ONLY YOU, INSENSIBLE
FANNY, WHO CAN THINK OF HIM WITH ANYTHING LIKE INDIFFERENCE. BUT ARE YOU
SO INSENSIBLE AS YOU PROFESS YOURSELF? NO, NO, I SEE YOU ARE NOT."

THERE WAS, INDEED, SO DEEP A BLUSH OVER FANNY'S FACE AT THAT MOMENT AS
MIGHT WARRANT STRONG SUSPICION IN A PREDISPOSED MIND.

"EXCELLENT CREATURE! I WILL NOT TEASE YOU. EVERYTHING SHALL TAKE ITS
COURSE. BUT, DEAR FANNY, YOU MUST ALLOW THAT YOU WERE NOT SO ABSOLUTELY
UNPREPARED TO HAVE THE QUESTION ASKED AS YOUR COUSIN FANCIES. IT IS NOT
POSSIBLE BUT THAT YOU MUST HAVE HAD SOME THOUGHTS ON THE SUBJECT, SOME
SURMISES AS TO WHAT MIGHT BE. YOU MUST HAVE SEEN THAT HE WAS TRYING TO
PLEASE YOU BY EVERY ATTENTION IN HIS POWER. WAS NOT HE DEVOTED TO YOU
AT THE BALL? AND THEN BEFORE THE BALL, THE NECKLACE! OH! YOU RECEIVED
IT JUST AS IT WAS MEANT. YOU WERE AS CONSCIOUS AS HEART COULD DESIRE. I
REMEMBER IT PERFECTLY."

"DO YOU MEAN, THEN, THAT YOUR BROTHER KNEW OF THE NECKLACE BEFOREHAND?
OH! MISS CRAWFORD, THAT WAS NOT FAIR."

"KNEW OF IT! IT WAS HIS OWN DOING ENTIRELY, HIS OWN THOUGHT. I AM
ASHAMED TO SAY THAT IT HAD NEVER ENTERED MY HEAD, BUT I WAS DELIGHTED TO
ACT ON HIS PROPOSAL FOR BOTH YOUR SAKES."

"I WILL NOT SAY," REPLIED FANNY, "THAT I WAS NOT HALF AFRAID AT THE TIME
OF ITS BEING SO, FOR THERE WAS SOMETHING IN YOUR LOOK THAT FRIGHTENED
ME, BUT NOT AT FIRST; I WAS AS UNSUSPICIOUS OF IT AT FIRST--INDEED,
INDEED I WAS. IT IS AS TRUE AS THAT I SIT HERE. AND HAD I HAD AN IDEA
OF IT, NOTHING SHOULD HAVE INDUCED ME TO ACCEPT THE NECKLACE. AS TO YOUR
BROTHER'S BEHAVIOUR, CERTAINLY I WAS SENSIBLE OF A PARTICULARITY: I HAD
BEEN SENSIBLE OF IT SOME LITTLE TIME, PERHAPS TWO OR THREE WEEKS; BUT
THEN I CONSIDERED IT AS MEANING NOTHING: I PUT IT DOWN AS SIMPLY BEING
HIS WAY, AND WAS AS FAR FROM SUPPOSING AS FROM WISHING HIM TO HAVE ANY
SERIOUS THOUGHTS OF ME. I HAD NOT, MISS CRAWFORD, BEEN AN INATTENTIVE
OBSERVER OF WHAT WAS PASSING BETWEEN HIM AND SOME PART OF THIS FAMILY IN
THE SUMMER AND AUTUMN. I WAS QUIET, BUT I WAS NOT BLIND. I COULD NOT
BUT SEE THAT MR. CRAWFORD ALLOWED HIMSELF IN GALLANTRIES WHICH DID MEAN
NOTHING."

"AH! I CANNOT DENY IT. HE HAS NOW AND THEN BEEN A SAD FLIRT, AND
CARED VERY LITTLE FOR THE HAVOC HE MIGHT BE MAKING IN YOUNG LADIES'
AFFECTIONS. I HAVE OFTEN SCOLDED HIM FOR IT, BUT IT IS HIS ONLY FAULT;
AND THERE IS THIS TO BE SAID, THAT VERY FEW YOUNG LADIES HAVE ANY
AFFECTIONS WORTH CARING FOR. AND THEN, FANNY, THE GLORY OF FIXING ONE
WHO HAS BEEN SHOT AT BY SO MANY; OF HAVING IT IN ONE'S POWER TO PAY OFF
THE DEBTS OF ONE'S SEX! OH! I AM SURE IT IS NOT IN WOMAN'S NATURE TO
REFUSE SUCH A TRIUMPH."

FANNY SHOOK HER HEAD. "I CANNOT THINK WELL OF A MAN WHO SPORTS WITH ANY
WOMAN'S FEELINGS; AND THERE MAY OFTEN BE A GREAT DEAL MORE SUFFERED THAN
A STANDER-BY CAN JUDGE OF."

"I DO NOT DEFEND HIM. I LEAVE HIM ENTIRELY TO YOUR MERCY, AND WHEN HE
HAS GOT YOU AT EVERINGHAM, I DO NOT CARE HOW MUCH YOU LECTURE HIM. BUT
THIS I WILL SAY, THAT HIS FAULT, THE LIKING TO MAKE GIRLS A LITTLE
IN LOVE WITH HIM, IS NOT HALF SO DANGEROUS TO A WIFE'S HAPPINESS AS A
TENDENCY TO FALL IN LOVE HIMSELF, WHICH HE HAS NEVER BEEN ADDICTED TO.
AND I DO SERIOUSLY AND TRULY BELIEVE THAT HE IS ATTACHED TO YOU IN A WAY
THAT HE NEVER WAS TO ANY WOMAN BEFORE; THAT HE LOVES YOU WITH ALL HIS
HEART, AND WILL LOVE YOU AS NEARLY FOR EVER AS POSSIBLE. IF ANY MAN EVER
LOVED A WOMAN FOR EVER, I THINK HENRY WILL DO AS MUCH FOR YOU."

FANNY COULD NOT AVOID A FAINT SMILE, BUT HAD NOTHING TO SAY.

"I CANNOT IMAGINE HENRY EVER TO HAVE BEEN HAPPIER," CONTINUED MARY
PRESENTLY, "THAN WHEN HE HAD SUCCEEDED IN GETTING YOUR BROTHER'S
COMMISSION."

SHE HAD MADE A SURE PUSH AT FANNY'S FEELINGS HERE.

"OH! YES. HOW VERY, VERY KIND OF HIM."

"I KNOW HE MUST HAVE EXERTED HIMSELF VERY MUCH, FOR I KNOW THE PARTIES
HE HAD TO MOVE. THE ADMIRAL HATES TROUBLE, AND SCORNS ASKING FAVOURS;
AND THERE ARE SO MANY YOUNG MEN'S CLAIMS TO BE ATTENDED TO IN THE SAME
WAY, THAT A FRIENDSHIP AND ENERGY, NOT VERY DETERMINED, IS EASILY PUT
BY. WHAT A HAPPY CREATURE WILLIAM MUST BE! I WISH WE COULD SEE HIM."

POOR FANNY'S MIND WAS THROWN INTO THE MOST DISTRESSING OF ALL ITS
VARIETIES. THE RECOLLECTION OF WHAT HAD BEEN DONE FOR WILLIAM WAS ALWAYS
THE MOST POWERFUL DISTURBER OF EVERY DECISION AGAINST MR. CRAWFORD; AND
SHE SAT THINKING DEEPLY OF IT TILL MARY, WHO HAD BEEN FIRST WATCHING
HER COMPLACENTLY, AND THEN MUSING ON SOMETHING ELSE, SUDDENLY CALLED
HER ATTENTION BY SAYING: "I SHOULD LIKE TO SIT TALKING WITH YOU HERE ALL
DAY, BUT WE MUST NOT FORGET THE LADIES BELOW, AND SO GOOD-BYE, MY DEAR,
MY AMIABLE, MY EXCELLENT FANNY, FOR THOUGH WE SHALL NOMINALLY PART IN
THE BREAKFAST-PARLOUR, I MUST TAKE LEAVE OF YOU HERE. AND I DO TAKE
LEAVE, LONGING FOR A HAPPY REUNION, AND TRUSTING THAT WHEN WE MEET
AGAIN, IT WILL BE UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH MAY OPEN OUR HEARTS TO EACH
OTHER WITHOUT ANY REMNANT OR SHADOW OF RESERVE."

A VERY, VERY KIND EMBRACE, AND SOME AGITATION OF MANNER, ACCOMPANIED
THESE WORDS.

"I SHALL SEE YOUR COUSIN IN TOWN SOON: HE TALKS OF BEING THERE TOLERABLY
SOON; AND SIR THOMAS, I DARE SAY, IN THE COURSE OF THE SPRING; AND YOUR
ELDEST COUSIN, AND THE RUSHWORTHS, AND JULIA, I AM SURE OF MEETING AGAIN
AND AGAIN, AND ALL BUT YOU. I HAVE TWO FAVOURS TO ASK, FANNY: ONE IS
YOUR CORRESPONDENCE. YOU MUST WRITE TO ME. AND THE OTHER, THAT YOU WILL
OFTEN CALL ON MRS. GRANT, AND MAKE HER AMENDS FOR MY BEING GONE."

THE FIRST, AT LEAST, OF THESE FAVOURS FANNY WOULD RATHER NOT HAVE BEEN
ASKED; BUT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HER TO REFUSE THE CORRESPONDENCE; IT
WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HER EVEN NOT TO ACCEDE TO IT MORE READILY THAN
HER OWN JUDGMENT AUTHORISED. THERE WAS NO RESISTING SO MUCH APPARENT
AFFECTION. HER DISPOSITION WAS PECULIARLY CALCULATED TO VALUE A FOND
TREATMENT, AND FROM HAVING HITHERTO KNOWN SO LITTLE OF IT, SHE WAS THE
MORE OVERCOME BY MISS CRAWFORD'S. BESIDES, THERE WAS GRATITUDE TOWARDS
HER, FOR HAVING MADE THEIR TETE-A-TETE SO MUCH LESS PAINFUL THAN HER
FEARS HAD PREDICTED.

IT WAS OVER, AND SHE HAD ESCAPED WITHOUT REPROACHES AND WITHOUT
DETECTION. HER SECRET WAS STILL HER OWN; AND WHILE THAT WAS THE CASE,
SHE THOUGHT SHE COULD RESIGN HERSELF TO ALMOST EVERYTHING.

IN THE EVENING THERE WAS ANOTHER PARTING. HENRY CRAWFORD CAME AND
SAT SOME TIME WITH THEM; AND HER SPIRITS NOT BEING PREVIOUSLY IN THE
STRONGEST STATE, HER HEART WAS SOFTENED FOR A WHILE TOWARDS HIM, BECAUSE
HE REALLY SEEMED TO FEEL. QUITE UNLIKE HIS USUAL SELF, HE SCARCELY SAID
ANYTHING. HE WAS EVIDENTLY OPPRESSED, AND FANNY MUST GRIEVE FOR HIM,
THOUGH HOPING SHE MIGHT NEVER SEE HIM AGAIN TILL HE WERE THE HUSBAND OF
SOME OTHER WOMAN.

WHEN IT CAME TO THE MOMENT OF PARTING, HE WOULD TAKE HER HAND, HE WOULD
NOT BE DENIED IT; HE SAID NOTHING, HOWEVER, OR NOTHING THAT SHE HEARD,
AND WHEN HE HAD LEFT THE ROOM, SHE WAS BETTER PLEASED THAT SUCH A TOKEN
OF FRIENDSHIP HAD PASSED.

ON THE MORROW THE CRAWFORDS WERE GONE.



CHAPTER XXXVII

MR. CRAWFORD GONE, SIR THOMAS'S NEXT OBJECT WAS THAT HE SHOULD BE
MISSED; AND HE ENTERTAINED GREAT HOPE THAT HIS NIECE WOULD FIND A BLANK
IN THE LOSS OF THOSE ATTENTIONS WHICH AT THE TIME SHE HAD FELT, OR
FANCIED, AN EVIL. SHE HAD TASTED OF CONSEQUENCE IN ITS MOST FLATTERING
FORM; AND HE DID HOPE THAT THE LOSS OF IT, THE SINKING AGAIN INTO
NOTHING, WOULD AWAKEN VERY WHOLESOME REGRETS IN HER MIND. HE WATCHED HER
WITH THIS IDEA; BUT HE COULD HARDLY TELL WITH WHAT SUCCESS. HE HARDLY
KNEW WHETHER THERE WERE ANY DIFFERENCE IN HER SPIRITS OR NOT. SHE
WAS ALWAYS SO GENTLE AND RETIRING THAT HER EMOTIONS WERE BEYOND HIS
DISCRIMINATION. HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND HER: HE FELT THAT HE DID NOT; AND
THEREFORE APPLIED TO EDMUND TO TELL HIM HOW SHE STOOD AFFECTED ON THE
PRESENT OCCASION, AND WHETHER SHE WERE MORE OR LESS HAPPY THAN SHE HAD
BEEN.

EDMUND DID NOT DISCERN ANY SYMPTOMS OF REGRET, AND THOUGHT HIS FATHER
A LITTLE UNREASONABLE IN SUPPOSING THE FIRST THREE OR FOUR DAYS COULD
PRODUCE ANY.

WHAT CHIEFLY SURPRISED EDMUND WAS, THAT CRAWFORD'S SISTER, THE FRIEND
AND COMPANION WHO HAD BEEN SO MUCH TO HER, SHOULD NOT BE MORE VISIBLY
REGRETTED. HE WONDERED THAT FANNY SPOKE SO SELDOM OF HER, AND HAD SO
LITTLE VOLUNTARILY TO SAY OF HER CONCERN AT THIS SEPARATION.

ALAS! IT WAS THIS SISTER, THIS FRIEND AND COMPANION, WHO WAS NOW THE
CHIEF BANE OF FANNY'S COMFORT. IF SHE COULD HAVE BELIEVED MARY'S FUTURE
FATE AS UNCONNECTED WITH MANSFIELD AS SHE WAS DETERMINED THE BROTHER'S
SHOULD BE, IF SHE COULD HAVE HOPED HER RETURN THITHER TO BE AS DISTANT
AS SHE WAS MUCH INCLINED TO THINK HIS, SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN LIGHT OF
HEART INDEED; BUT THE MORE SHE RECOLLECTED AND OBSERVED, THE MORE DEEPLY
WAS SHE CONVINCED THAT EVERYTHING WAS NOW IN A FAIRER TRAIN FOR MISS
CRAWFORD'S MARRYING EDMUND THAN IT HAD EVER BEEN BEFORE. ON HIS SIDE THE
INCLINATION WAS STRONGER, ON HERS LESS EQUIVOCAL. HIS OBJECTIONS, THE
SCRUPLES OF HIS INTEGRITY, SEEMED ALL DONE AWAY, NOBODY COULD TELL
HOW; AND THE DOUBTS AND HESITATIONS OF HER AMBITION WERE EQUALLY GOT
OVER--AND EQUALLY WITHOUT APPARENT REASON. IT COULD ONLY BE IMPUTED TO
INCREASING ATTACHMENT. HIS GOOD AND HER BAD FEELINGS YIELDED TO LOVE,
AND SUCH LOVE MUST UNITE THEM. HE WAS TO GO TO TOWN AS SOON AS SOME
BUSINESS RELATIVE TO THORNTON LACEY WERE COMPLETED--PERHAPS WITHIN A
FORTNIGHT; HE TALKED OF GOING, HE LOVED TO TALK OF IT; AND WHEN ONCE
WITH HER AGAIN, FANNY COULD NOT DOUBT THE REST. HER ACCEPTANCE MUST BE
AS CERTAIN AS HIS OFFER; AND YET THERE WERE BAD FEELINGS STILL REMAINING
WHICH MADE THE PROSPECT OF IT MOST SORROWFUL TO HER, INDEPENDENTLY, SHE
BELIEVED, INDEPENDENTLY OF SELF.

IN THEIR VERY LAST CONVERSATION, MISS CRAWFORD, IN SPITE OF SOME AMIABLE
SENSATIONS, AND MUCH PERSONAL KINDNESS, HAD STILL BEEN MISS CRAWFORD;
STILL SHEWN A MIND LED ASTRAY AND BEWILDERED, AND WITHOUT ANY SUSPICION
OF BEING SO; DARKENED, YET FANCYING ITSELF LIGHT. SHE MIGHT LOVE, BUT
SHE DID NOT DESERVE EDMUND BY ANY OTHER SENTIMENT. FANNY BELIEVED THERE
WAS SCARCELY A SECOND FEELING IN COMMON BETWEEN THEM; AND SHE MAY BE
FORGIVEN BY OLDER SAGES FOR LOOKING ON THE CHANCE OF MISS CRAWFORD'S
FUTURE IMPROVEMENT AS NEARLY DESPERATE, FOR THINKING THAT IF EDMUND'S
INFLUENCE IN THIS SEASON OF LOVE HAD ALREADY DONE SO LITTLE IN CLEARING
HER JUDGMENT, AND REGULATING HER NOTIONS, HIS WORTH WOULD BE FINALLY
WASTED ON HER EVEN IN YEARS OF MATRIMONY.

EXPERIENCE MIGHT HAVE HOPED MORE FOR ANY YOUNG PEOPLE SO CIRCUMSTANCED,
AND IMPARTIALITY WOULD NOT HAVE DENIED TO MISS CRAWFORD'S NATURE THAT
PARTICIPATION OF THE GENERAL NATURE OF WOMEN WHICH WOULD LEAD HER TO
ADOPT THE OPINIONS OF THE MAN SHE LOVED AND RESPECTED AS HER OWN. BUT
AS SUCH WERE FANNY'S PERSUASIONS, SHE SUFFERED VERY MUCH FROM THEM, AND
COULD NEVER SPEAK OF MISS CRAWFORD WITHOUT PAIN.

SIR THOMAS, MEANWHILE, WENT ON WITH HIS OWN HOPES AND HIS OWN
OBSERVATIONS, STILL FEELING A RIGHT, BY ALL HIS KNOWLEDGE OF HUMAN
NATURE, TO EXPECT TO SEE THE EFFECT OF THE LOSS OF POWER AND CONSEQUENCE
ON HIS NIECE'S SPIRITS, AND THE PAST ATTENTIONS OF THE LOVER PRODUCING A
CRAVING FOR THEIR RETURN; AND HE WAS SOON AFTERWARDS ABLE TO ACCOUNT FOR
HIS NOT YET COMPLETELY AND INDUBITABLY SEEING ALL THIS, BY THE PROSPECT
OF ANOTHER VISITOR, WHOSE APPROACH HE COULD ALLOW TO BE QUITE ENOUGH TO
SUPPORT THE SPIRITS HE WAS WATCHING. WILLIAM HAD OBTAINED A TEN DAYS'
LEAVE OF ABSENCE, TO BE GIVEN TO NORTHAMPTONSHIRE, AND WAS COMING, THE
HAPPIEST OF LIEUTENANTS, BECAUSE THE LATEST MADE, TO SHEW HIS HAPPINESS
AND DESCRIBE HIS UNIFORM.

HE CAME; AND HE WOULD HAVE BEEN DELIGHTED TO SHEW HIS UNIFORM THERE TOO,
HAD NOT CRUEL CUSTOM PROHIBITED ITS APPEARANCE EXCEPT ON DUTY. SO THE
UNIFORM REMAINED AT PORTSMOUTH, AND EDMUND CONJECTURED THAT BEFORE FANNY
HAD ANY CHANCE OF SEEING IT, ALL ITS OWN FRESHNESS AND ALL THE FRESHNESS
OF ITS WEARER'S FEELINGS MUST BE WORN AWAY. IT WOULD BE SUNK INTO A
BADGE OF DISGRACE; FOR WHAT CAN BE MORE UNBECOMING, OR MORE WORTHLESS,
THAN THE UNIFORM OF A LIEUTENANT, WHO HAS BEEN A LIEUTENANT A YEAR OR
TWO, AND SEES OTHERS MADE COMMANDERS BEFORE HIM? SO REASONED EDMUND,
TILL HIS FATHER MADE HIM THE CONFIDANT OF A SCHEME WHICH PLACED FANNY'S
CHANCE OF SEEING THE SECOND LIEUTENANT OF H.M.S. THRUSH IN ALL HIS GLORY
IN ANOTHER LIGHT.

THIS SCHEME WAS THAT SHE SHOULD ACCOMPANY HER BROTHER BACK TO
PORTSMOUTH, AND SPEND A LITTLE TIME WITH HER OWN FAMILY. IT HAD OCCURRED
TO SIR THOMAS, IN ONE OF HIS DIGNIFIED MUSINGS, AS A RIGHT AND DESIRABLE
MEASURE; BUT BEFORE HE ABSOLUTELY MADE UP HIS MIND, HE CONSULTED HIS
SON. EDMUND CONSIDERED IT EVERY WAY, AND SAW NOTHING BUT WHAT WAS RIGHT.
THE THING WAS GOOD IN ITSELF, AND COULD NOT BE DONE AT A BETTER TIME;
AND HE HAD NO DOUBT OF IT BEING HIGHLY AGREEABLE TO FANNY. THIS WAS
ENOUGH TO DETERMINE SIR THOMAS; AND A DECISIVE "THEN SO IT SHALL BE"
CLOSED THAT STAGE OF THE BUSINESS; SIR THOMAS RETIRING FROM IT WITH SOME
FEELINGS OF SATISFACTION, AND VIEWS OF GOOD OVER AND ABOVE WHAT HE HAD
COMMUNICATED TO HIS SON; FOR HIS PRIME MOTIVE IN SENDING HER AWAY HAD
VERY LITTLE TO DO WITH THE PROPRIETY OF HER SEEING HER PARENTS AGAIN,
AND NOTHING AT ALL WITH ANY IDEA OF MAKING HER HAPPY. HE CERTAINLY
WISHED HER TO GO WILLINGLY, BUT HE AS CERTAINLY WISHED HER TO BE
HEARTILY SICK OF HOME BEFORE HER VISIT ENDED; AND THAT A LITTLE
ABSTINENCE FROM THE ELEGANCIES AND LUXURIES OF MANSFIELD PARK WOULD
BRING HER MIND INTO A SOBER STATE, AND INCLINE HER TO A JUSTER ESTIMATE
OF THE VALUE OF THAT HOME OF GREATER PERMANENCE, AND EQUAL COMFORT, OF
WHICH SHE HAD THE OFFER.

IT WAS A MEDICINAL PROJECT UPON HIS NIECE'S UNDERSTANDING, WHICH HE MUST
CONSIDER AS AT PRESENT DISEASED. A RESIDENCE OF EIGHT OR NINE YEARS IN
THE ABODE OF WEALTH AND PLENTY HAD A LITTLE DISORDERED HER POWERS OF
COMPARING AND JUDGING. HER FATHER'S HOUSE WOULD, IN ALL PROBABILITY,
TEACH HER THE VALUE OF A GOOD INCOME; AND HE TRUSTED THAT SHE WOULD BE
THE WISER AND HAPPIER WOMAN, ALL HER LIFE, FOR THE EXPERIMENT HE HAD
DEVISED.

HAD FANNY BEEN AT ALL ADDICTED TO RAPTURES, SHE MUST HAVE HAD A STRONG
ATTACK OF THEM WHEN SHE FIRST UNDERSTOOD WHAT WAS INTENDED, WHEN HER
UNCLE FIRST MADE HER THE OFFER OF VISITING THE PARENTS, AND BROTHERS,
AND SISTERS, FROM WHOM SHE HAD BEEN DIVIDED ALMOST HALF HER LIFE; OF
RETURNING FOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS TO THE SCENES OF HER INFANCY, WITH
WILLIAM FOR THE PROTECTOR AND COMPANION OF HER JOURNEY, AND THE
CERTAINTY OF CONTINUING TO SEE WILLIAM TO THE LAST HOUR OF HIS REMAINING
ON LAND. HAD SHE EVER GIVEN WAY TO BURSTS OF DELIGHT, IT MUST HAVE BEEN
THEN, FOR SHE WAS DELIGHTED, BUT HER HAPPINESS WAS OF A QUIET, DEEP,
HEART-SWELLING SORT; AND THOUGH NEVER A GREAT TALKER, SHE WAS ALWAYS
MORE INCLINED TO SILENCE WHEN FEELING MOST STRONGLY. AT THE MOMENT SHE
COULD ONLY THANK AND ACCEPT. AFTERWARDS, WHEN FAMILIARISED WITH THE
VISIONS OF ENJOYMENT SO SUDDENLY OPENED, SHE COULD SPEAK MORE LARGELY
TO WILLIAM AND EDMUND OF WHAT SHE FELT; BUT STILL THERE WERE EMOTIONS
OF TENDERNESS THAT COULD NOT BE CLOTHED IN WORDS. THE REMEMBRANCE OF ALL
HER EARLIEST PLEASURES, AND OF WHAT SHE HAD SUFFERED IN BEING TORN FROM
THEM, CAME OVER HER WITH RENEWED STRENGTH, AND IT SEEMED AS IF TO BE
AT HOME AGAIN WOULD HEAL EVERY PAIN THAT HAD SINCE GROWN OUT OF THE
SEPARATION. TO BE IN THE CENTRE OF SUCH A CIRCLE, LOVED BY SO MANY,
AND MORE LOVED BY ALL THAN SHE HAD EVER BEEN BEFORE; TO FEEL AFFECTION
WITHOUT FEAR OR RESTRAINT; TO FEEL HERSELF THE EQUAL OF THOSE WHO
SURROUNDED HER; TO BE AT PEACE FROM ALL MENTION OF THE CRAWFORDS, SAFE
FROM EVERY LOOK WHICH COULD BE FANCIED A REPROACH ON THEIR ACCOUNT. THIS
WAS A PROSPECT TO BE DWELT ON WITH A FONDNESS THAT COULD BE BUT HALF
ACKNOWLEDGED.

EDMUND, TOO--TO BE TWO MONTHS FROM HIM (AND PERHAPS SHE MIGHT BE
ALLOWED TO MAKE HER ABSENCE THREE) MUST DO HER GOOD. AT A DISTANCE,
UNASSAILED BY HIS LOOKS OR HIS KINDNESS, AND SAFE FROM THE PERPETUAL
IRRITATION OF KNOWING HIS HEART, AND STRIVING TO AVOID HIS CONFIDENCE,
SHE SHOULD BE ABLE TO REASON HERSELF INTO A PROPERER STATE; SHE SHOULD
BE ABLE TO THINK OF HIM AS IN LONDON, AND ARRANGING EVERYTHING THERE,
WITHOUT WRETCHEDNESS. WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN HARD TO BEAR AT MANSFIELD WAS
TO BECOME A SLIGHT EVIL AT PORTSMOUTH.

THE ONLY DRAWBACK WAS THE DOUBT OF HER AUNT BERTRAM'S BEING COMFORTABLE
WITHOUT HER. SHE WAS OF USE TO NO ONE ELSE; BUT THERE SHE MIGHT BE
MISSED TO A DEGREE THAT SHE DID NOT LIKE TO THINK OF; AND THAT PART OF
THE ARRANGEMENT WAS, INDEED, THE HARDEST FOR SIR THOMAS TO ACCOMPLISH,
AND WHAT ONLY HE COULD HAVE ACCOMPLISHED AT ALL.

BUT HE WAS MASTER AT MANSFIELD PARK. WHEN HE HAD REALLY RESOLVED ON
ANY MEASURE, HE COULD ALWAYS CARRY IT THROUGH; AND NOW BY DINT OF LONG
TALKING ON THE SUBJECT, EXPLAINING AND DWELLING ON THE DUTY OF FANNY'S
SOMETIMES SEEING HER FAMILY, HE DID INDUCE HIS WIFE TO LET HER GO;
OBTAINING IT RATHER FROM SUBMISSION, HOWEVER, THAN CONVICTION, FOR LADY
BERTRAM WAS CONVINCED OF VERY LITTLE MORE THAN THAT SIR THOMAS THOUGHT
FANNY OUGHT TO GO, AND THEREFORE THAT SHE MUST. IN THE CALMNESS OF
HER OWN DRESSING-ROOM, IN THE IMPARTIAL FLOW OF HER OWN MEDITATIONS,
UNBIASSED BY HIS BEWILDERING STATEMENTS, SHE COULD NOT ACKNOWLEDGE ANY
NECESSITY FOR FANNY'S EVER GOING NEAR A FATHER AND MOTHER WHO HAD DONE
WITHOUT HER SO LONG, WHILE SHE WAS SO USEFUL TO HERSELF. AND AS TO THE
NOT MISSING HER, WHICH UNDER MRS. NORRIS'S DISCUSSION WAS THE POINT
ATTEMPTED TO BE PROVED, SHE SET HERSELF VERY STEADILY AGAINST ADMITTING
ANY SUCH THING.

SIR THOMAS HAD APPEALED TO HER REASON, CONSCIENCE, AND DIGNITY. HE
CALLED IT A SACRIFICE, AND DEMANDED IT OF HER GOODNESS AND SELF-COMMAND
AS SUCH. BUT MRS. NORRIS WANTED TO PERSUADE HER THAT FANNY COULD BE VERY
WELL SPARED--SHE BEING READY TO GIVE UP ALL HER OWN TIME TO HER AS
REQUESTED--AND, IN SHORT, COULD NOT REALLY BE WANTED OR MISSED.

"THAT MAY BE, SISTER," WAS ALL LADY BERTRAM'S REPLY. "I DARE SAY YOU ARE
VERY RIGHT; BUT I AM SURE I SHALL MISS HER VERY MUCH."

THE NEXT STEP WAS TO COMMUNICATE WITH PORTSMOUTH. FANNY WROTE TO OFFER
HERSELF; AND HER MOTHER'S ANSWER, THOUGH SHORT, WAS SO KIND--A FEW
SIMPLE LINES EXPRESSED SO NATURAL AND MOTHERLY A JOY IN THE PROSPECT
OF SEEING HER CHILD AGAIN, AS TO CONFIRM ALL THE DAUGHTER'S VIEWS OF
HAPPINESS IN BEING WITH HER--CONVINCING HER THAT SHE SHOULD NOW FIND A
WARM AND AFFECTIONATE FRIEND IN THE "MAMA" WHO HAD CERTAINLY SHEWN NO
REMARKABLE FONDNESS FOR HER FORMERLY; BUT THIS SHE COULD EASILY SUPPOSE
TO HAVE BEEN HER OWN FAULT OR HER OWN FANCY. SHE HAD PROBABLY ALIENATED
LOVE BY THE HELPLESSNESS AND FRETFULNESS OF A FEARFUL TEMPER, OR BEEN
UNREASONABLE IN WANTING A LARGER SHARE THAN ANY ONE AMONG SO MANY COULD
DESERVE. NOW, WHEN SHE KNEW BETTER HOW TO BE USEFUL, AND HOW TO FORBEAR,
AND WHEN HER MOTHER COULD BE NO LONGER OCCUPIED BY THE INCESSANT
DEMANDS OF A HOUSE FULL OF LITTLE CHILDREN, THERE WOULD BE LEISURE AND
INCLINATION FOR EVERY COMFORT, AND THEY SHOULD SOON BE WHAT MOTHER AND
DAUGHTER OUGHT TO BE TO EACH OTHER.

WILLIAM WAS ALMOST AS HAPPY IN THE PLAN AS HIS SISTER. IT WOULD BE THE
GREATEST PLEASURE TO HIM TO HAVE HER THERE TO THE LAST MOMENT BEFORE HE
SAILED, AND PERHAPS FIND HER THERE STILL WHEN HE CAME IN FROM HIS FIRST
CRUISE. AND BESIDES, HE WANTED HER SO VERY MUCH TO SEE THE THRUSH BEFORE
SHE WENT OUT OF HARBOUR--THE THRUSH WAS CERTAINLY THE FINEST SLOOP IN
THE SERVICE--AND THERE WERE SEVERAL IMPROVEMENTS IN THE DOCKYARD, TOO,
WHICH HE QUITE LONGED TO SHEW HER.

HE DID NOT SCRUPLE TO ADD THAT HER BEING AT HOME FOR A WHILE WOULD BE A
GREAT ADVANTAGE TO EVERYBODY.

"I DO NOT KNOW HOW IT IS," SAID HE; "BUT WE SEEM TO WANT SOME OF
YOUR NICE WAYS AND ORDERLINESS AT MY FATHER'S. THE HOUSE IS ALWAYS IN
CONFUSION. YOU WILL SET THINGS GOING IN A BETTER WAY, I AM SURE. YOU
WILL TELL MY MOTHER HOW IT ALL OUGHT TO BE, AND YOU WILL BE SO USEFUL TO
SUSAN, AND YOU WILL TEACH BETSEY, AND MAKE THE BOYS LOVE AND MIND YOU.
HOW RIGHT AND COMFORTABLE IT WILL ALL BE!"

BY THE TIME MRS. PRICE'S ANSWER ARRIVED, THERE REMAINED BUT A VERY FEW
DAYS MORE TO BE SPENT AT MANSFIELD; AND FOR PART OF ONE OF THOSE DAYS
THE YOUNG TRAVELLERS WERE IN A GOOD DEAL OF ALARM ON THE SUBJECT OF
THEIR JOURNEY, FOR WHEN THE MODE OF IT CAME TO BE TALKED OF, AND MRS.
NORRIS FOUND THAT ALL HER ANXIETY TO SAVE HER BROTHER-IN-LAW'S MONEY
WAS VAIN, AND THAT IN SPITE OF HER WISHES AND HINTS FOR A LESS EXPENSIVE
CONVEYANCE OF FANNY, THEY WERE TO TRAVEL POST; WHEN SHE SAW SIR THOMAS
ACTUALLY GIVE WILLIAM NOTES FOR THE PURPOSE, SHE WAS STRUCK WITH THE
IDEA OF THERE BEING ROOM FOR A THIRD IN THE CARRIAGE, AND SUDDENLY
SEIZED WITH A STRONG INCLINATION TO GO WITH THEM, TO GO AND SEE HER POOR
DEAR SISTER PRICE. SHE PROCLAIMED HER THOUGHTS. SHE MUST SAY THAT SHE
HAD MORE THAN HALF A MIND TO GO WITH THE YOUNG PEOPLE; IT WOULD BE SUCH
AN INDULGENCE TO HER; SHE HAD NOT SEEN HER POOR DEAR SISTER PRICE FOR
MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS; AND IT WOULD BE A HELP TO THE YOUNG PEOPLE IN
THEIR JOURNEY TO HAVE HER OLDER HEAD TO MANAGE FOR THEM; AND SHE COULD
NOT HELP THINKING HER POOR DEAR SISTER PRICE WOULD FEEL IT VERY UNKIND
OF HER NOT TO COME BY SUCH AN OPPORTUNITY.

WILLIAM AND FANNY WERE HORROR-STRUCK AT THE IDEA.

ALL THE COMFORT OF THEIR COMFORTABLE JOURNEY WOULD BE DESTROYED AT
ONCE. WITH WOEFUL COUNTENANCES THEY LOOKED AT EACH OTHER. THEIR SUSPENSE
LASTED AN HOUR OR TWO. NO ONE INTERFERED TO ENCOURAGE OR DISSUADE. MRS.
NORRIS WAS LEFT TO SETTLE THE MATTER BY HERSELF; AND IT ENDED, TO THE
INFINITE JOY OF HER NEPHEW AND NIECE, IN THE RECOLLECTION THAT SHE COULD
NOT POSSIBLY BE SPARED FROM MANSFIELD PARK AT PRESENT; THAT SHE WAS A
GREAT DEAL TOO NECESSARY TO SIR THOMAS AND LADY BERTRAM FOR HER TO
BE ABLE TO ANSWER IT TO HERSELF TO LEAVE THEM EVEN FOR A WEEK, AND
THEREFORE MUST CERTAINLY SACRIFICE EVERY OTHER PLEASURE TO THAT OF BEING
USEFUL TO THEM.

IT HAD, IN FACT, OCCURRED TO HER, THAT THOUGH TAKEN TO PORTSMOUTH FOR
NOTHING, IT WOULD BE HARDLY POSSIBLE FOR HER TO AVOID PAYING HER OWN
EXPENSES BACK AGAIN. SO HER POOR DEAR SISTER PRICE WAS LEFT TO ALL THE
DISAPPOINTMENT OF HER MISSING SUCH AN OPPORTUNITY, AND ANOTHER TWENTY
YEARS' ABSENCE, PERHAPS, BEGUN.

EDMUND'S PLANS WERE AFFECTED BY THIS PORTSMOUTH JOURNEY, THIS ABSENCE OF
FANNY'S. HE TOO HAD A SACRIFICE TO MAKE TO MANSFIELD PARK AS WELL AS HIS
AUNT. HE HAD INTENDED, ABOUT THIS TIME, TO BE GOING TO LONDON; BUT HE
COULD NOT LEAVE HIS FATHER AND MOTHER JUST WHEN EVERYBODY ELSE OF MOST
IMPORTANCE TO THEIR COMFORT WAS LEAVING THEM; AND WITH AN EFFORT, FELT
BUT NOT BOASTED OF, HE DELAYED FOR A WEEK OR TWO LONGER A JOURNEY WHICH
HE WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO WITH THE HOPE OF ITS FIXING HIS HAPPINESS FOR
EVER.

HE TOLD FANNY OF IT. SHE KNEW SO MUCH ALREADY, THAT SHE MUST KNOW
EVERYTHING. IT MADE THE SUBSTANCE OF ONE OTHER CONFIDENTIAL DISCOURSE
ABOUT MISS CRAWFORD; AND FANNY WAS THE MORE AFFECTED FROM FEELING IT TO
BE THE LAST TIME IN WHICH MISS CRAWFORD'S NAME WOULD EVER BE MENTIONED
BETWEEN THEM WITH ANY REMAINS OF LIBERTY. ONCE AFTERWARDS SHE WAS
ALLUDED TO BY HIM. LADY BERTRAM HAD BEEN TELLING HER NIECE IN THE
EVENING TO WRITE TO HER SOON AND OFTEN, AND PROMISING TO BE A GOOD
CORRESPONDENT HERSELF; AND EDMUND, AT A CONVENIENT MOMENT, THEN ADDED
IN A WHISPER, "AND I SHALL WRITE TO YOU, FANNY, WHEN I HAVE ANYTHING
WORTH WRITING ABOUT, ANYTHING TO SAY THAT I THINK YOU WILL LIKE TO HEAR,
AND THAT YOU WILL NOT HEAR SO SOON FROM ANY OTHER QUARTER." HAD SHE
DOUBTED HIS MEANING WHILE SHE LISTENED, THE GLOW IN HIS FACE, WHEN SHE
LOOKED UP AT HIM, WOULD HAVE BEEN DECISIVE.

FOR THIS LETTER SHE MUST TRY TO ARM HERSELF. THAT A LETTER FROM EDMUND
SHOULD BE A SUBJECT OF TERROR! SHE BEGAN TO FEEL THAT SHE HAD NOT YET
GONE THROUGH ALL THE CHANGES OF OPINION AND SENTIMENT WHICH THE PROGRESS
OF TIME AND VARIATION OF CIRCUMSTANCES OCCASION IN THIS WORLD OF
CHANGES. THE VICISSITUDES OF THE HUMAN MIND HAD NOT YET BEEN EXHAUSTED
BY HER.

POOR FANNY! THOUGH GOING AS SHE DID WILLINGLY AND EAGERLY, THE LAST
EVENING AT MANSFIELD PARK MUST STILL BE WRETCHEDNESS. HER HEART WAS
COMPLETELY SAD AT PARTING. SHE HAD TEARS FOR EVERY ROOM IN THE HOUSE,
MUCH MORE FOR EVERY BELOVED INHABITANT. SHE CLUNG TO HER AUNT, BECAUSE
SHE WOULD MISS HER; SHE KISSED THE HAND OF HER UNCLE WITH STRUGGLING
SOBS, BECAUSE SHE HAD DISPLEASED HIM; AND AS FOR EDMUND, SHE COULD
NEITHER SPEAK, NOR LOOK, NOR THINK, WHEN THE LAST MOMENT CAME WITH
HIM; AND IT WAS NOT TILL IT WAS OVER THAT SHE KNEW HE WAS GIVING HER
THE AFFECTIONATE FAREWELL OF A BROTHER.

ALL THIS PASSED OVERNIGHT, FOR THE JOURNEY WAS TO BEGIN VERY EARLY IN
THE MORNING; AND WHEN THE SMALL, DIMINISHED PARTY MET AT BREAKFAST,
WILLIAM AND FANNY WERE TALKED OF AS ALREADY ADVANCED ONE STAGE.



CHAPTER XXXVIII

THE NOVELTY OF TRAVELLING, AND THE HAPPINESS OF BEING WITH WILLIAM, SOON
PRODUCED THEIR NATURAL EFFECT ON FANNY'S SPIRITS, WHEN MANSFIELD PARK
WAS FAIRLY LEFT BEHIND; AND BY THE TIME THEIR FIRST STAGE WAS ENDED, AND
THEY WERE TO QUIT SIR THOMAS'S CARRIAGE, SHE WAS ABLE TO TAKE LEAVE OF
THE OLD COACHMAN, AND SEND BACK PROPER MESSAGES, WITH CHEERFUL LOOKS.

OF PLEASANT TALK BETWEEN THE BROTHER AND SISTER THERE WAS NO END.
EVERYTHING SUPPLIED AN AMUSEMENT TO THE HIGH GLEE OF WILLIAM'S MIND, AND
HE WAS FULL OF FROLIC AND JOKE IN THE INTERVALS OF THEIR HIGHER-TONED
SUBJECTS, ALL OF WHICH ENDED, IF THEY DID NOT BEGIN, IN PRAISE OF THE
THRUSH, CONJECTURES HOW SHE WOULD BE EMPLOYED, SCHEMES FOR AN ACTION
WITH SOME SUPERIOR FORCE, WHICH (SUPPOSING THE FIRST LIEUTENANT OUT OF
THE WAY, AND WILLIAM WAS NOT VERY MERCIFUL TO THE FIRST LIEUTENANT) WAS
TO GIVE HIMSELF THE NEXT STEP AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, OR SPECULATIONS UPON
PRIZE-MONEY, WHICH WAS TO BE GENEROUSLY DISTRIBUTED AT HOME, WITH ONLY
THE RESERVATION OF ENOUGH TO MAKE THE LITTLE COTTAGE COMFORTABLE,
IN WHICH HE AND FANNY WERE TO PASS ALL THEIR MIDDLE AND LATER LIFE
TOGETHER.

FANNY'S IMMEDIATE CONCERNS, AS FAR AS THEY INVOLVED MR. CRAWFORD, MADE
NO PART OF THEIR CONVERSATION. WILLIAM KNEW WHAT HAD PASSED, AND FROM
HIS HEART LAMENTED THAT HIS SISTER'S FEELINGS SHOULD BE SO COLD TOWARDS
A MAN WHOM HE MUST CONSIDER AS THE FIRST OF HUMAN CHARACTERS; BUT HE WAS
OF AN AGE TO BE ALL FOR LOVE, AND THEREFORE UNABLE TO BLAME; AND KNOWING
HER WISH ON THE SUBJECT, HE WOULD NOT DISTRESS HER BY THE SLIGHTEST
ALLUSION.

SHE HAD REASON TO SUPPOSE HERSELF NOT YET FORGOTTEN BY MR. CRAWFORD. SHE
HAD HEARD REPEATEDLY FROM HIS SISTER WITHIN THE THREE WEEKS WHICH HAD
PASSED SINCE THEIR LEAVING MANSFIELD, AND IN EACH LETTER THERE HAD BEEN
A FEW LINES FROM HIMSELF, WARM AND DETERMINED LIKE HIS SPEECHES. IT
WAS A CORRESPONDENCE WHICH FANNY FOUND QUITE AS UNPLEASANT AS SHE HAD
FEARED. MISS CRAWFORD'S STYLE OF WRITING, LIVELY AND AFFECTIONATE, WAS
ITSELF AN EVIL, INDEPENDENT OF WHAT SHE WAS THUS FORCED INTO READING
FROM THE BROTHER'S PEN, FOR EDMUND WOULD NEVER REST TILL SHE HAD READ
THE CHIEF OF THE LETTER TO HIM; AND THEN SHE HAD TO LISTEN TO HIS
ADMIRATION OF HER LANGUAGE, AND THE WARMTH OF HER ATTACHMENTS. THERE
HAD, IN FACT, BEEN SO MUCH OF MESSAGE, OF ALLUSION, OF RECOLLECTION, SO
MUCH OF MANSFIELD IN EVERY LETTER, THAT FANNY COULD NOT BUT SUPPOSE IT
MEANT FOR HIM TO HEAR; AND TO FIND HERSELF FORCED INTO A PURPOSE OF
THAT KIND, COMPELLED INTO A CORRESPONDENCE WHICH WAS BRINGING HER THE
ADDRESSES OF THE MAN SHE DID NOT LOVE, AND OBLIGING HER TO ADMINISTER
TO THE ADVERSE PASSION OF THE MAN SHE DID, WAS CRUELLY MORTIFYING. HERE,
TOO, HER PRESENT REMOVAL PROMISED ADVANTAGE. WHEN NO LONGER UNDER THE
SAME ROOF WITH EDMUND, SHE TRUSTED THAT MISS CRAWFORD WOULD HAVE NO
MOTIVE FOR WRITING STRONG ENOUGH TO OVERCOME THE TROUBLE, AND THAT AT
PORTSMOUTH THEIR CORRESPONDENCE WOULD DWINDLE INTO NOTHING.

WITH SUCH THOUGHTS AS THESE, AMONG TEN HUNDRED OTHERS, FANNY PROCEEDED
IN HER JOURNEY SAFELY AND CHEERFULLY, AND AS EXPEDITIOUSLY AS COULD
RATIONALLY BE HOPED IN THE DIRTY MONTH OF FEBRUARY. THEY ENTERED OXFORD,
BUT SHE COULD TAKE ONLY A HASTY GLIMPSE OF EDMUND'S COLLEGE AS THEY
PASSED ALONG, AND MADE NO STOP ANYWHERE TILL THEY REACHED NEWBURY, WHERE
A COMFORTABLE MEAL, UNITING DINNER AND SUPPER, WOUND UP THE ENJOYMENTS
AND FATIGUES OF THE DAY.

THE NEXT MORNING SAW THEM OFF AGAIN AT AN EARLY HOUR; AND WITH NO
EVENTS, AND NO DELAYS, THEY REGULARLY ADVANCED, AND WERE IN THE ENVIRONS
OF PORTSMOUTH WHILE THERE WAS YET DAYLIGHT FOR FANNY TO LOOK AROUND HER,
AND WONDER AT THE NEW BUILDINGS. THEY PASSED THE DRAWBRIDGE, AND
ENTERED THE TOWN; AND THE LIGHT WAS ONLY BEGINNING TO FAIL AS, GUIDED
BY WILLIAM'S POWERFUL VOICE, THEY WERE RATTLED INTO A NARROW STREET,
LEADING FROM THE HIGH STREET, AND DRAWN UP BEFORE THE DOOR OF A SMALL
HOUSE NOW INHABITED BY MR. PRICE.

FANNY WAS ALL AGITATION AND FLUTTER; ALL HOPE AND APPREHENSION. THE
MOMENT THEY STOPPED, A TROLLOPY-LOOKING MAIDSERVANT, SEEMINGLY IN
WAITING FOR THEM AT THE DOOR, STEPPED FORWARD, AND MORE INTENT ON
TELLING THE NEWS THAN GIVING THEM ANY HELP, IMMEDIATELY BEGAN WITH, "THE
THRUSH IS GONE OUT OF HARBOUR, PLEASE SIR, AND ONE OF THE OFFICERS HAS
BEEN HERE TO--" SHE WAS INTERRUPTED BY A FINE TALL BOY OF ELEVEN YEARS
OLD, WHO, RUSHING OUT OF THE HOUSE, PUSHED THE MAID ASIDE, AND WHILE
WILLIAM WAS OPENING THE CHAISE-DOOR HIMSELF, CALLED OUT, "YOU ARE JUST
IN TIME. WE HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU THIS HALF-HOUR. THE THRUSH WENT
OUT OF HARBOUR THIS MORNING. I SAW HER. IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL SIGHT. AND
THEY THINK SHE WILL HAVE HER ORDERS IN A DAY OR TWO. AND MR. CAMPBELL
WAS HERE AT FOUR O'CLOCK TO ASK FOR YOU: HE HAS GOT ONE OF THE THRUSH'S
BOATS, AND IS GOING OFF TO HER AT SIX, AND HOPED YOU WOULD BE HERE IN
TIME TO GO WITH HIM."

A STARE OR TWO AT FANNY, AS WILLIAM HELPED HER OUT OF THE CARRIAGE, WAS
ALL THE VOLUNTARY NOTICE WHICH THIS BROTHER BESTOWED; BUT HE MADE NO
OBJECTION TO HER KISSING HIM, THOUGH STILL ENTIRELY ENGAGED IN DETAILING
FARTHER PARTICULARS OF THE THRUSH'S GOING OUT OF HARBOUR, IN WHICH
HE HAD A STRONG RIGHT OF INTEREST, BEING TO COMMENCE HIS CAREER OF
SEAMANSHIP IN HER AT THIS VERY TIME.

ANOTHER MOMENT AND FANNY WAS IN THE NARROW ENTRANCE-PASSAGE OF THE
HOUSE, AND IN HER MOTHER'S ARMS, WHO MET HER THERE WITH LOOKS OF TRUE
KINDNESS, AND WITH FEATURES WHICH FANNY LOVED THE MORE, BECAUSE THEY
BROUGHT HER AUNT BERTRAM'S BEFORE HER, AND THERE WERE HER TWO SISTERS:
SUSAN, A WELL-GROWN FINE GIRL OF FOURTEEN, AND BETSEY, THE YOUNGEST OF
THE FAMILY, ABOUT FIVE--BOTH GLAD TO SEE HER IN THEIR WAY, THOUGH WITH
NO ADVANTAGE OF MANNER IN RECEIVING HER. BUT MANNER FANNY DID NOT WANT.
WOULD THEY BUT LOVE HER, SHE SHOULD BE SATISFIED.

SHE WAS THEN TAKEN INTO A PARLOUR, SO SMALL THAT HER FIRST CONVICTION
WAS OF ITS BEING ONLY A PASSAGE-ROOM TO SOMETHING BETTER, AND SHE STOOD
FOR A MOMENT EXPECTING TO BE INVITED ON; BUT WHEN SHE SAW THERE WAS
NO OTHER DOOR, AND THAT THERE WERE SIGNS OF HABITATION BEFORE HER, SHE
CALLED BACK HER THOUGHTS, REPROVED HERSELF, AND GRIEVED LEST THEY SHOULD
HAVE BEEN SUSPECTED. HER MOTHER, HOWEVER, COULD NOT STAY LONG ENOUGH
TO SUSPECT ANYTHING. SHE WAS GONE AGAIN TO THE STREET-DOOR, TO WELCOME
WILLIAM. "OH! MY DEAR WILLIAM, HOW GLAD I AM TO SEE YOU. BUT HAVE YOU
HEARD ABOUT THE THRUSH? SHE IS GONE OUT OF HARBOUR ALREADY; THREE DAYS
BEFORE WE HAD ANY THOUGHT OF IT; AND I DO NOT KNOW WHAT I AM TO DO ABOUT
SAM'S THINGS, THEY WILL NEVER BE READY IN TIME; FOR SHE MAY HAVE HER
ORDERS TO-MORROW, PERHAPS. IT TAKES ME QUITE UNAWARES. AND NOW YOU MUST
BE OFF FOR SPITHEAD TOO. CAMPBELL HAS BEEN HERE, QUITE IN A WORRY ABOUT
YOU; AND NOW WHAT SHALL WE DO? I THOUGHT TO HAVE HAD SUCH A COMFORTABLE
EVENING WITH YOU, AND HERE EVERYTHING COMES UPON ME AT ONCE."

HER SON ANSWERED CHEERFULLY, TELLING HER THAT EVERYTHING WAS ALWAYS FOR
THE BEST; AND MAKING LIGHT OF HIS OWN INCONVENIENCE IN BEING OBLIGED TO
HURRY AWAY SO SOON.

"TO BE SURE, I HAD MUCH RATHER SHE HAD STAYED IN HARBOUR, THAT I MIGHT
HAVE SAT A FEW HOURS WITH YOU IN COMFORT; BUT AS THERE IS A BOAT ASHORE,
I HAD BETTER GO OFF AT ONCE, AND THERE IS NO HELP FOR IT. WHEREABOUTS
DOES THE THRUSH LAY AT SPITHEAD? NEAR THE CANOPUS? BUT NO MATTER; HERE'S
FANNY IN THE PARLOUR, AND WHY SHOULD WE STAY IN THE PASSAGE? COME,
MOTHER, YOU HAVE HARDLY LOOKED AT YOUR OWN DEAR FANNY YET."

IN THEY BOTH CAME, AND MRS. PRICE HAVING KINDLY KISSED HER DAUGHTER
AGAIN, AND COMMENTED A LITTLE ON HER GROWTH, BEGAN WITH VERY NATURAL
SOLICITUDE TO FEEL FOR THEIR FATIGUES AND WANTS AS TRAVELLERS.

"POOR DEARS! HOW TIRED YOU MUST BOTH BE! AND NOW, WHAT WILL YOU HAVE? I
BEGAN TO THINK YOU WOULD NEVER COME. BETSEY AND I HAVE BEEN WATCHING FOR
YOU THIS HALF-HOUR. AND WHEN DID YOU GET ANYTHING TO EAT? AND WHAT WOULD
YOU LIKE TO HAVE NOW? I COULD NOT TELL WHETHER YOU WOULD BE FOR SOME
MEAT, OR ONLY A DISH OF TEA, AFTER YOUR JOURNEY, OR ELSE I WOULD HAVE
GOT SOMETHING READY. AND NOW I AM AFRAID CAMPBELL WILL BE HERE BEFORE
THERE IS TIME TO DRESS A STEAK, AND WE HAVE NO BUTCHER AT HAND. IT IS
VERY INCONVENIENT TO HAVE NO BUTCHER IN THE STREET. WE WERE BETTER OFF
IN OUR LAST HOUSE. PERHAPS YOU WOULD LIKE SOME TEA AS SOON AS IT CAN BE
GOT."

THEY BOTH DECLARED THEY SHOULD PREFER IT TO ANYTHING. "THEN, BETSEY, MY
DEAR, RUN INTO THE KITCHEN AND SEE IF REBECCA HAS PUT THE WATER ON; AND
TELL HER TO BRING IN THE TEA-THINGS AS SOON AS SHE CAN. I WISH WE COULD
GET THE BELL MENDED; BUT BETSEY IS A VERY HANDY LITTLE MESSENGER."

BETSEY WENT WITH ALACRITY, PROUD TO SHEW HER ABILITIES BEFORE HER FINE
NEW SISTER.

"DEAR ME!" CONTINUED THE ANXIOUS MOTHER, "WHAT A SAD FIRE WE HAVE GOT,
AND I DARE SAY YOU ARE BOTH STARVED WITH COLD. DRAW YOUR CHAIR NEARER,
MY DEAR. I CANNOT THINK WHAT REBECCA HAS BEEN ABOUT. I AM SURE I TOLD
HER TO BRING SOME COALS HALF AN HOUR AGO. SUSAN, YOU SHOULD HAVE TAKEN
CARE OF THE FIRE."

"I WAS UPSTAIRS, MAMA, MOVING MY THINGS," SAID SUSAN, IN A FEARLESS,
SELF-DEFENDING TONE, WHICH STARTLED FANNY. "YOU KNOW YOU HAD BUT JUST
SETTLED THAT MY SISTER FANNY AND I SHOULD HAVE THE OTHER ROOM; AND I
COULD NOT GET REBECCA TO GIVE ME ANY HELP."

FARTHER DISCUSSION WAS PREVENTED BY VARIOUS BUSTLES: FIRST, THE DRIVER
CAME TO BE PAID; THEN THERE WAS A SQUABBLE BETWEEN SAM AND REBECCA ABOUT
THE MANNER OF CARRYING UP HIS SISTER'S TRUNK, WHICH HE WOULD MANAGE ALL
HIS OWN WAY; AND LASTLY, IN WALKED MR. PRICE HIMSELF, HIS OWN LOUD VOICE
PRECEDING HIM, AS WITH SOMETHING OF THE OATH KIND HE KICKED AWAY HIS
SON'S PORT-MANTEAU AND HIS DAUGHTER'S BANDBOX IN THE PASSAGE, AND CALLED
OUT FOR A CANDLE; NO CANDLE WAS BROUGHT, HOWEVER, AND HE WALKED INTO THE
ROOM.

FANNY WITH DOUBTING FEELINGS HAD RISEN TO MEET HIM, BUT SANK DOWN AGAIN
ON FINDING HERSELF UNDISTINGUISHED IN THE DUSK, AND UNTHOUGHT OF. WITH
A FRIENDLY SHAKE OF HIS SON'S HAND, AND AN EAGER VOICE, HE INSTANTLY
BEGAN--"HA! WELCOME BACK, MY BOY. GLAD TO SEE YOU. HAVE YOU HEARD THE
NEWS? THE THRUSH WENT OUT OF HARBOUR THIS MORNING. SHARP IS THE
WORD, YOU SEE! BY G--, YOU ARE JUST IN TIME! THE DOCTOR HAS BEEN HERE
INQUIRING FOR YOU: HE HAS GOT ONE OF THE BOATS, AND IS TO BE OFF FOR
SPITHEAD BY SIX, SO YOU HAD BETTER GO WITH HIM. I HAVE BEEN TO TURNER'S
ABOUT YOUR MESS; IT IS ALL IN A WAY TO BE DONE. I SHOULD NOT WONDER IF
YOU HAD YOUR ORDERS TO-MORROW: BUT YOU CANNOT SAIL WITH THIS WIND, IF
YOU ARE TO CRUISE TO THE WESTWARD; AND CAPTAIN WALSH THINKS YOU WILL
CERTAINLY HAVE A CRUISE TO THE WESTWARD, WITH THE ELEPHANT. BY G--, I
WISH YOU MAY! BUT OLD SCHOLEY WAS SAYING, JUST NOW, THAT HE THOUGHT YOU
WOULD BE SENT FIRST TO THE TEXEL. WELL, WELL, WE ARE READY, WHATEVER
HAPPENS. BUT BY G--, YOU LOST A FINE SIGHT BY NOT BEING HERE IN THE
MORNING TO SEE THE THRUSH GO OUT OF HARBOUR! I WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN OUT
OF THE WAY FOR A THOUSAND POUNDS. OLD SCHOLEY RAN IN AT BREAKFAST-TIME,
TO SAY SHE HAD SLIPPED HER MOORINGS AND WAS COMING OUT, I JUMPED UP, AND
MADE BUT TWO STEPS TO THE PLATFORM. IF EVER THERE WAS A PERFECT BEAUTY
AFLOAT, SHE IS ONE; AND THERE SHE LAYS AT SPITHEAD, AND ANYBODY IN
ENGLAND WOULD TAKE HER FOR AN EIGHT-AND-TWENTY. I WAS UPON THE PLATFORM
TWO HOURS THIS AFTERNOON LOOKING AT HER. SHE LAYS CLOSE TO THE ENDYMION,
BETWEEN HER AND THE CLEOPATRA, JUST TO THE EASTWARD OF THE SHEER HULK."

"HA!" CRIED WILLIAM, "THAT'S JUST WHERE I SHOULD HAVE PUT HER MYSELF.
IT'S THE BEST BERTH AT SPITHEAD. BUT HERE IS MY SISTER, SIR; HERE IS
FANNY," TURNING AND LEADING HER FORWARD; "IT IS SO DARK YOU DO NOT SEE
HER."

WITH AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT THAT HE HAD QUITE FORGOT HER, MR. PRICE NOW
RECEIVED HIS DAUGHTER; AND HAVING GIVEN HER A CORDIAL HUG, AND OBSERVED
THAT SHE WAS GROWN INTO A WOMAN, AND HE SUPPOSED WOULD BE WANTING A
HUSBAND SOON, SEEMED VERY MUCH INCLINED TO FORGET HER AGAIN. FANNY
SHRUNK BACK TO HER SEAT, WITH FEELINGS SADLY PAINED BY HIS LANGUAGE AND
HIS SMELL OF SPIRITS; AND HE TALKED ON ONLY TO HIS SON, AND ONLY OF THE
THRUSH, THOUGH WILLIAM, WARMLY INTERESTED AS HE WAS IN THAT SUBJECT,
MORE THAN ONCE TRIED TO MAKE HIS FATHER THINK OF FANNY, AND HER LONG
ABSENCE AND LONG JOURNEY.

AFTER SITTING SOME TIME LONGER, A CANDLE WAS OBTAINED; BUT AS THERE WAS
STILL NO APPEARANCE OF TEA, NOR, FROM BETSEY'S REPORTS FROM THE KITCHEN,
MUCH HOPE OF ANY UNDER A CONSIDERABLE PERIOD, WILLIAM DETERMINED TO
GO AND CHANGE HIS DRESS, AND MAKE THE NECESSARY PREPARATIONS FOR
HIS REMOVAL ON BOARD DIRECTLY, THAT HE MIGHT HAVE HIS TEA IN COMFORT
AFTERWARDS.

AS HE LEFT THE ROOM, TWO ROSY-FACED BOYS, RAGGED AND DIRTY, ABOUT EIGHT
AND NINE YEARS OLD, RUSHED INTO IT JUST RELEASED FROM SCHOOL, AND COMING
EAGERLY TO SEE THEIR SISTER, AND TELL THAT THE THRUSH WAS GONE OUT OF
HARBOUR; TOM AND CHARLES. CHARLES HAD BEEN BORN SINCE FANNY'S GOING
AWAY, BUT TOM SHE HAD OFTEN HELPED TO NURSE, AND NOW FELT A PARTICULAR
PLEASURE IN SEEING AGAIN. BOTH WERE KISSED VERY TENDERLY, BUT TOM SHE
WANTED TO KEEP BY HER, TO TRY TO TRACE THE FEATURES OF THE BABY SHE HAD
LOVED, AND TALKED TO, OF HIS INFANT PREFERENCE OF HERSELF. TOM, HOWEVER,
HAD NO MIND FOR SUCH TREATMENT: HE CAME HOME NOT TO STAND AND BE TALKED
TO, BUT TO RUN ABOUT AND MAKE A NOISE; AND BOTH BOYS HAD SOON BURST FROM
HER, AND SLAMMED THE PARLOUR-DOOR TILL HER TEMPLES ACHED.

SHE HAD NOW SEEN ALL THAT WERE AT HOME; THERE REMAINED ONLY TWO BROTHERS
BETWEEN HERSELF AND SUSAN, ONE OF WHOM WAS A CLERK IN A PUBLIC OFFICE
IN LONDON, AND THE OTHER MIDSHIPMAN ON BOARD AN INDIAMAN. BUT THOUGH SHE
HAD SEEN ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY, SHE HAD NOT YET HEARD ALL
THE NOISE THEY COULD MAKE. ANOTHER QUARTER OF AN HOUR BROUGHT HER A
GREAT DEAL MORE. WILLIAM WAS SOON CALLING OUT FROM THE LANDING-PLACE OF
THE SECOND STORY FOR HIS MOTHER AND FOR REBECCA. HE WAS IN DISTRESS
FOR SOMETHING THAT HE HAD LEFT THERE, AND DID NOT FIND AGAIN. A KEY WAS
MISLAID, BETSEY ACCUSED OF HAVING GOT AT HIS NEW HAT, AND SOME SLIGHT,
BUT ESSENTIAL ALTERATION OF HIS UNIFORM WAISTCOAT, WHICH HE HAD BEEN
PROMISED TO HAVE DONE FOR HIM, ENTIRELY NEGLECTED.

MRS. PRICE, REBECCA, AND BETSEY ALL WENT UP TO DEFEND THEMSELVES, ALL
TALKING TOGETHER, BUT REBECCA LOUDEST, AND THE JOB WAS TO BE DONE AS
WELL AS IT COULD IN A GREAT HURRY; WILLIAM TRYING IN VAIN TO SEND BETSEY
DOWN AGAIN, OR KEEP HER FROM BEING TROUBLESOME WHERE SHE WAS; THE WHOLE
OF WHICH, AS ALMOST EVERY DOOR IN THE HOUSE WAS OPEN, COULD BE PLAINLY
DISTINGUISHED IN THE PARLOUR, EXCEPT WHEN DROWNED AT INTERVALS BY THE
SUPERIOR NOISE OF SAM, TOM, AND CHARLES CHASING EACH OTHER UP AND DOWN
STAIRS, AND TUMBLING ABOUT AND HALLOOING.

FANNY WAS ALMOST STUNNED. THE SMALLNESS OF THE HOUSE AND THINNESS OF THE
WALLS BROUGHT EVERYTHING SO CLOSE TO HER, THAT, ADDED TO THE FATIGUE OF
HER JOURNEY, AND ALL HER RECENT AGITATION, SHE HARDLY KNEW HOW TO
BEAR IT. WITHIN THE ROOM ALL WAS TRANQUIL ENOUGH, FOR SUSAN HAVING
DISAPPEARED WITH THE OTHERS, THERE WERE SOON ONLY HER FATHER AND HERSELF
REMAINING; AND HE, TAKING OUT A NEWSPAPER, THE ACCUSTOMARY LOAN OF A
NEIGHBOUR, APPLIED HIMSELF TO STUDYING IT, WITHOUT SEEMING TO RECOLLECT
HER EXISTENCE. THE SOLITARY CANDLE WAS HELD BETWEEN HIMSELF AND THE
PAPER, WITHOUT ANY REFERENCE TO HER POSSIBLE CONVENIENCE; BUT SHE HAD
NOTHING TO DO, AND WAS GLAD TO HAVE THE LIGHT SCREENED FROM HER ACHING
HEAD, AS SHE SAT IN BEWILDERED, BROKEN, SORROWFUL CONTEMPLATION.

SHE WAS AT HOME. BUT, ALAS! IT WAS NOT SUCH A HOME, SHE HAD NOT SUCH A
WELCOME, AS--SHE CHECKED HERSELF; SHE WAS UNREASONABLE. WHAT RIGHT HAD
SHE TO BE OF IMPORTANCE TO HER FAMILY? SHE COULD HAVE NONE, SO LONG LOST
SIGHT OF! WILLIAM'S CONCERNS MUST BE DEAREST, THEY ALWAYS HAD BEEN, AND
HE HAD EVERY RIGHT. YET TO HAVE SO LITTLE SAID OR ASKED ABOUT HERSELF,
TO HAVE SCARCELY AN INQUIRY MADE AFTER MANSFIELD! IT DID PAIN HER TO
HAVE MANSFIELD FORGOTTEN; THE FRIENDS WHO HAD DONE SO MUCH--THE DEAR,
DEAR FRIENDS! BUT HERE, ONE SUBJECT SWALLOWED UP ALL THE REST. PERHAPS
IT MUST BE SO. THE DESTINATION OF THE THRUSH MUST BE NOW PREEMINENTLY
INTERESTING. A DAY OR TWO MIGHT SHEW THE DIFFERENCE. SHE ONLY WAS TO
BLAME. YET SHE THOUGHT IT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SO AT MANSFIELD. NO, IN
HER UNCLE'S HOUSE THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN A CONSIDERATION OF TIMES AND
SEASONS, A REGULATION OF SUBJECT, A PROPRIETY, AN ATTENTION TOWARDS
EVERYBODY WHICH THERE WAS NOT HERE.

THE ONLY INTERRUPTION WHICH THOUGHTS LIKE THESE RECEIVED FOR NEARLY HALF
AN HOUR WAS FROM A SUDDEN BURST OF HER FATHER'S, NOT AT ALL CALCULATED
TO COMPOSE THEM. AT A MORE THAN ORDINARY PITCH OF THUMPING AND HALLOOING
IN THE PASSAGE, HE EXCLAIMED, "DEVIL TAKE THOSE YOUNG DOGS! HOW THEY ARE
SINGING OUT! AY, SAM'S VOICE LOUDER THAN ALL THE REST! THAT BOY IS FIT
FOR A BOATSWAIN. HOLLA, YOU THERE! SAM, STOP YOUR CONFOUNDED PIPE, OR I
SHALL BE AFTER YOU."

THIS THREAT WAS SO PALPABLY DISREGARDED, THAT THOUGH WITHIN FIVE MINUTES
AFTERWARDS THE THREE BOYS ALL BURST INTO THE ROOM TOGETHER AND SAT DOWN,
FANNY COULD NOT CONSIDER IT AS A PROOF OF ANYTHING MORE THAN THEIR
BEING FOR THE TIME THOROUGHLY FAGGED, WHICH THEIR HOT FACES AND PANTING
BREATHS SEEMED TO PROVE, ESPECIALLY AS THEY WERE STILL KICKING EACH
OTHER'S SHINS, AND HALLOOING OUT AT SUDDEN STARTS IMMEDIATELY UNDER
THEIR FATHER'S EYE.

THE NEXT OPENING OF THE DOOR BROUGHT SOMETHING MORE WELCOME: IT WAS FOR
THE TEA-THINGS, WHICH SHE HAD BEGUN ALMOST TO DESPAIR OF SEEING THAT
EVENING. SUSAN AND AN ATTENDANT GIRL, WHOSE INFERIOR APPEARANCE INFORMED
FANNY, TO HER GREAT SURPRISE, THAT SHE HAD PREVIOUSLY SEEN THE UPPER
SERVANT, BROUGHT IN EVERYTHING NECESSARY FOR THE MEAL; SUSAN LOOKING, AS
SHE PUT THE KETTLE ON THE FIRE AND GLANCED AT HER SISTER, AS IF DIVIDED
BETWEEN THE AGREEABLE TRIUMPH OF SHEWING HER ACTIVITY AND USEFULNESS,
AND THE DREAD OF BEING THOUGHT TO DEMEAN HERSELF BY SUCH AN OFFICE. "SHE
HAD BEEN INTO THE KITCHEN," SHE SAID, "TO HURRY SALLY AND HELP MAKE THE
TOAST, AND SPREAD THE BREAD AND BUTTER, OR SHE DID NOT KNOW WHEN THEY
SHOULD HAVE GOT TEA, AND SHE WAS SURE HER SISTER MUST WANT SOMETHING
AFTER HER JOURNEY."

FANNY WAS VERY THANKFUL. SHE COULD NOT BUT OWN THAT SHE SHOULD BE VERY
GLAD OF A LITTLE TEA, AND SUSAN IMMEDIATELY SET ABOUT MAKING IT, AS IF
PLEASED TO HAVE THE EMPLOYMENT ALL TO HERSELF; AND WITH ONLY A LITTLE
UNNECESSARY BUSTLE, AND SOME FEW INJUDICIOUS ATTEMPTS AT KEEPING HER
BROTHERS IN BETTER ORDER THAN SHE COULD, ACQUITTED HERSELF VERY WELL.
FANNY'S SPIRIT WAS AS MUCH REFRESHED AS HER BODY; HER HEAD AND HEART
WERE SOON THE BETTER FOR SUCH WELL-TIMED KINDNESS. SUSAN HAD AN OPEN,
SENSIBLE COUNTENANCE; SHE WAS LIKE WILLIAM, AND FANNY HOPED TO FIND HER
LIKE HIM IN DISPOSITION AND GOODWILL TOWARDS HERSELF.

IN THIS MORE PLACID STATE OF THINGS WILLIAM REENTERED, FOLLOWED NOT
FAR BEHIND BY HIS MOTHER AND BETSEY. HE, COMPLETE IN HIS LIEUTENANT'S
UNIFORM, LOOKING AND MOVING ALL THE TALLER, FIRMER, AND MORE GRACEFUL
FOR IT, AND WITH THE HAPPIEST SMILE OVER HIS FACE, WALKED UP DIRECTLY
TO FANNY, WHO, RISING FROM HER SEAT, LOOKED AT HIM FOR A MOMENT IN
SPEECHLESS ADMIRATION, AND THEN THREW HER ARMS ROUND HIS NECK TO SOB OUT
HER VARIOUS EMOTIONS OF PAIN AND PLEASURE.

ANXIOUS NOT TO APPEAR UNHAPPY, SHE SOON RECOVERED HERSELF; AND WIPING
AWAY HER TEARS, WAS ABLE TO NOTICE AND ADMIRE ALL THE STRIKING PARTS
OF HIS DRESS; LISTENING WITH REVIVING SPIRITS TO HIS CHEERFUL HOPES OF
BEING ON SHORE SOME PART OF EVERY DAY BEFORE THEY SAILED, AND EVEN OF
GETTING HER TO SPITHEAD TO SEE THE SLOOP.

THE NEXT BUSTLE BROUGHT IN MR. CAMPBELL, THE SURGEON OF THE THRUSH, A
VERY WELL-BEHAVED YOUNG MAN, WHO CAME TO CALL FOR HIS FRIEND, AND FOR
WHOM THERE WAS WITH SOME CONTRIVANCE FOUND A CHAIR, AND WITH SOME HASTY
WASHING OF THE YOUNG TEA-MAKER'S, A CUP AND SAUCER; AND AFTER ANOTHER
QUARTER OF AN HOUR OF EARNEST TALK BETWEEN THE GENTLEMEN, NOISE RISING
UPON NOISE, AND BUSTLE UPON BUSTLE, MEN AND BOYS AT LAST ALL IN MOTION
TOGETHER, THE MOMENT CAME FOR SETTING OFF; EVERYTHING WAS READY, WILLIAM
TOOK LEAVE, AND ALL OF THEM WERE GONE; FOR THE THREE BOYS, IN SPITE
OF THEIR MOTHER'S ENTREATY, DETERMINED TO SEE THEIR BROTHER AND MR.
CAMPBELL TO THE SALLY-PORT; AND MR. PRICE WALKED OFF AT THE SAME TIME TO
CARRY BACK HIS NEIGHBOUR'S NEWSPAPER.

SOMETHING LIKE TRANQUILLITY MIGHT NOW BE HOPED FOR; AND ACCORDINGLY,
WHEN REBECCA HAD BEEN PREVAILED ON TO CARRY AWAY THE TEA-THINGS,
AND MRS. PRICE HAD WALKED ABOUT THE ROOM SOME TIME LOOKING FOR A
SHIRT-SLEEVE, WHICH BETSEY AT LAST HUNTED OUT FROM A DRAWER IN THE
KITCHEN, THE SMALL PARTY OF FEMALES WERE PRETTY WELL COMPOSED, AND THE
MOTHER HAVING LAMENTED AGAIN OVER THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF GETTING SAM READY
IN TIME, WAS AT LEISURE TO THINK OF HER ELDEST DAUGHTER AND THE FRIENDS
SHE HAD COME FROM.

A FEW INQUIRIES BEGAN: BUT ONE OF THE EARLIEST--"HOW DID SISTER BERTRAM
MANAGE ABOUT HER SERVANTS?" "WAS SHE AS MUCH PLAGUED AS HERSELF TO GET
TOLERABLE SERVANTS?"--SOON LED HER MIND AWAY FROM NORTHAMPTONSHIRE, AND
FIXED IT ON HER OWN DOMESTIC GRIEVANCES, AND THE SHOCKING CHARACTER OF
ALL THE PORTSMOUTH SERVANTS, OF WHOM SHE BELIEVED HER OWN TWO WERE THE
VERY WORST, ENGROSSED HER COMPLETELY. THE BERTRAMS WERE ALL FORGOTTEN
IN DETAILING THE FAULTS OF REBECCA, AGAINST WHOM SUSAN HAD ALSO MUCH
TO DEPOSE, AND LITTLE BETSEY A GREAT DEAL MORE, AND WHO DID SEEM SO
THOROUGHLY WITHOUT A SINGLE RECOMMENDATION, THAT FANNY COULD NOT HELP
MODESTLY PRESUMING THAT HER MOTHER MEANT TO PART WITH HER WHEN HER YEAR
WAS UP.

"HER YEAR!" CRIED MRS. PRICE; "I AM SURE I HOPE I SHALL BE RID OF HER
BEFORE SHE HAS STAID A YEAR, FOR THAT WILL NOT BE UP TILL NOVEMBER.
SERVANTS ARE COME TO SUCH A PASS, MY DEAR, IN PORTSMOUTH, THAT IT IS
QUITE A MIRACLE IF ONE KEEPS THEM MORE THAN HALF A YEAR. I HAVE NO HOPE
OF EVER BEING SETTLED; AND IF I WAS TO PART WITH REBECCA, I SHOULD
ONLY GET SOMETHING WORSE. AND YET I DO NOT THINK I AM A VERY DIFFICULT
MISTRESS TO PLEASE; AND I AM SURE THE PLACE IS EASY ENOUGH, FOR THERE IS
ALWAYS A GIRL UNDER HER, AND I OFTEN DO HALF THE WORK MYSELF."

FANNY WAS SILENT; BUT NOT FROM BEING CONVINCED THAT THERE MIGHT NOT BE A
REMEDY FOUND FOR SOME OF THESE EVILS. AS SHE NOW SAT LOOKING AT BETSEY,
SHE COULD NOT BUT THINK PARTICULARLY OF ANOTHER SISTER, A VERY PRETTY
LITTLE GIRL, WHOM SHE HAD LEFT THERE NOT MUCH YOUNGER WHEN SHE WENT INTO
NORTHAMPTONSHIRE, WHO HAD DIED A FEW YEARS AFTERWARDS. THERE HAD BEEN
SOMETHING REMARKABLY AMIABLE ABOUT HER. FANNY IN THOSE EARLY DAYS HAD
PREFERRED HER TO SUSAN; AND WHEN THE NEWS OF HER DEATH HAD AT LAST
REACHED MANSFIELD, HAD FOR A SHORT TIME BEEN QUITE AFFLICTED. THE SIGHT
OF BETSEY BROUGHT THE IMAGE OF LITTLE MARY BACK AGAIN, BUT SHE WOULD
NOT HAVE PAINED HER MOTHER BY ALLUDING TO HER FOR THE WORLD. WHILE
CONSIDERING HER WITH THESE IDEAS, BETSEY, AT A SMALL DISTANCE, WAS
HOLDING OUT SOMETHING TO CATCH HER EYES, MEANING TO SCREEN IT AT THE
SAME TIME FROM SUSAN'S.

"WHAT HAVE YOU GOT THERE, MY LOVE?" SAID FANNY; "COME AND SHEW IT TO
ME."

IT WAS A SILVER KNIFE. UP JUMPED SUSAN, CLAIMING IT AS HER OWN, AND
TRYING TO GET IT AWAY; BUT THE CHILD RAN TO HER MOTHER'S PROTECTION,
AND SUSAN COULD ONLY REPROACH, WHICH SHE DID VERY WARMLY, AND EVIDENTLY
HOPING TO INTEREST FANNY ON HER SIDE. "IT WAS VERY HARD THAT SHE WAS NOT
TO HAVE HER OWN KNIFE; IT WAS HER OWN KNIFE; LITTLE SISTER MARY HAD
LEFT IT TO HER UPON HER DEATHBED, AND SHE OUGHT TO HAVE HAD IT TO KEEP
HERSELF LONG AGO. BUT MAMA KEPT IT FROM HER, AND WAS ALWAYS LETTING
BETSEY GET HOLD OF IT; AND THE END OF IT WOULD BE THAT BETSEY WOULD
SPOIL IT, AND GET IT FOR HER OWN, THOUGH MAMA HAD PROMISED HER THAT
BETSEY SHOULD NOT HAVE IT IN HER OWN HANDS."

FANNY WAS QUITE SHOCKED. EVERY FEELING OF DUTY, HONOUR, AND TENDERNESS
WAS WOUNDED BY HER SISTER'S SPEECH AND HER MOTHER'S REPLY.

"NOW, SUSAN," CRIED MRS. PRICE, IN A COMPLAINING VOICE, "NOW, HOW CAN
YOU BE SO CROSS? YOU ARE ALWAYS QUARRELLING ABOUT THAT KNIFE. I WISH YOU
WOULD NOT BE SO QUARRELSOME. POOR LITTLE BETSEY; HOW CROSS SUSAN IS TO
YOU! BUT YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE TAKEN IT OUT, MY DEAR, WHEN I SENT YOU TO
THE DRAWER. YOU KNOW I TOLD YOU NOT TO TOUCH IT, BECAUSE SUSAN IS SO
CROSS ABOUT IT. I MUST HIDE IT ANOTHER TIME, BETSEY. POOR MARY LITTLE
THOUGHT IT WOULD BE SUCH A BONE OF CONTENTION WHEN SHE GAVE IT ME TO
KEEP, ONLY TWO HOURS BEFORE SHE DIED. POOR LITTLE SOUL! SHE COULD BUT
JUST SPEAK TO BE HEARD, AND SHE SAID SO PRETTILY, 'LET SISTER SUSAN HAVE
MY KNIFE, MAMA, WHEN I AM DEAD AND BURIED.' POOR LITTLE DEAR! SHE WAS SO
FOND OF IT, FANNY, THAT SHE WOULD HAVE IT LAY BY HER IN BED, ALL THROUGH
HER ILLNESS. IT WAS THE GIFT OF HER GOOD GODMOTHER, OLD MRS. ADMIRAL
MAXWELL, ONLY SIX WEEKS BEFORE SHE WAS TAKEN FOR DEATH. POOR LITTLE
SWEET CREATURE! WELL, SHE WAS TAKEN AWAY FROM EVIL TO COME. MY OWN
BETSEY" (FONDLING HER), "YOU HAVE NOT THE LUCK OF SUCH A GOOD
GODMOTHER. AUNT NORRIS LIVES TOO FAR OFF TO THINK OF SUCH LITTLE PEOPLE
AS YOU."

FANNY HAD INDEED NOTHING TO CONVEY FROM AUNT NORRIS, BUT A MESSAGE TO
SAY SHE HOPED THAT HER GOD-DAUGHTER WAS A GOOD GIRL, AND LEARNT HER
BOOK. THERE HAD BEEN AT ONE MOMENT A SLIGHT MURMUR IN THE DRAWING-ROOM
AT MANSFIELD PARK ABOUT SENDING HER A PRAYER-BOOK; BUT NO SECOND SOUND
HAD BEEN HEARD OF SUCH A PURPOSE. MRS. NORRIS, HOWEVER, HAD GONE HOME
AND TAKEN DOWN TWO OLD PRAYER-BOOKS OF HER HUSBAND WITH THAT IDEA; BUT,
UPON EXAMINATION, THE ARDOUR OF GENEROSITY WENT OFF. ONE WAS FOUND
TO HAVE TOO SMALL A PRINT FOR A CHILD'S EYES, AND THE OTHER TO BE TOO
CUMBERSOME FOR HER TO CARRY ABOUT.

FANNY, FATIGUED AND FATIGUED AGAIN, WAS THANKFUL TO ACCEPT THE FIRST
INVITATION OF GOING TO BED; AND BEFORE BETSEY HAD FINISHED HER CRY AT
BEING ALLOWED TO SIT UP ONLY ONE HOUR EXTRAORDINARY IN HONOUR OF SISTER,
SHE WAS OFF, LEAVING ALL BELOW IN CONFUSION AND NOISE AGAIN; THE BOYS
BEGGING FOR TOASTED CHEESE, HER FATHER CALLING OUT FOR HIS RUM AND
WATER, AND REBECCA NEVER WHERE SHE OUGHT TO BE.

THERE WAS NOTHING TO RAISE HER SPIRITS IN THE CONFINED AND SCANTILY
FURNISHED CHAMBER THAT SHE WAS TO SHARE WITH SUSAN. THE SMALLNESS OF
THE ROOMS ABOVE AND BELOW, INDEED, AND THE NARROWNESS OF THE PASSAGE AND
STAIRCASE, STRUCK HER BEYOND HER IMAGINATION. SHE SOON LEARNED TO THINK
WITH RESPECT OF HER OWN LITTLE ATTIC AT MANSFIELD PARK, IN THAT HOUSE
RECKONED TOO SMALL FOR ANYBODY'S COMFORT.



CHAPTER XXXIX

COULD SIR THOMAS HAVE SEEN ALL HIS NIECE'S FEELINGS, WHEN SHE WROTE HER
FIRST LETTER TO HER AUNT, HE WOULD NOT HAVE DESPAIRED; FOR THOUGH A GOOD
NIGHT'S REST, A PLEASANT MORNING, THE HOPE OF SOON SEEING WILLIAM AGAIN,
AND THE COMPARATIVELY QUIET STATE OF THE HOUSE, FROM TOM AND CHARLES
BEING GONE TO SCHOOL, SAM ON SOME PROJECT OF HIS OWN, AND HER FATHER
ON HIS USUAL LOUNGES, ENABLED HER TO EXPRESS HERSELF CHEERFULLY ON THE
SUBJECT OF HOME, THERE WERE STILL, TO HER OWN PERFECT CONSCIOUSNESS,
MANY DRAWBACKS SUPPRESSED. COULD HE HAVE SEEN ONLY HALF THAT SHE FELT
BEFORE THE END OF A WEEK, HE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT MR. CRAWFORD SURE OF
HER, AND BEEN DELIGHTED WITH HIS OWN SAGACITY.

BEFORE THE WEEK ENDED, IT WAS ALL DISAPPOINTMENT. IN THE FIRST PLACE,
WILLIAM WAS GONE. THE THRUSH HAD HAD HER ORDERS, THE WIND HAD CHANGED,
AND HE WAS SAILED WITHIN FOUR DAYS FROM THEIR REACHING PORTSMOUTH; AND
DURING THOSE DAYS SHE HAD SEEN HIM ONLY TWICE, IN A SHORT AND
HURRIED WAY, WHEN HE HAD COME ASHORE ON DUTY. THERE HAD BEEN NO FREE
CONVERSATION, NO WALK ON THE RAMPARTS, NO VISIT TO THE DOCKYARD, NO
ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE THRUSH, NOTHING OF ALL THAT THEY HAD PLANNED AND
DEPENDED ON. EVERYTHING IN THAT QUARTER FAILED HER, EXCEPT WILLIAM'S
AFFECTION. HIS LAST THOUGHT ON LEAVING HOME WAS FOR HER. HE STEPPED BACK
AGAIN TO THE DOOR TO SAY, "TAKE CARE OF FANNY, MOTHER. SHE IS TENDER,
AND NOT USED TO ROUGH IT LIKE THE REST OF US. I CHARGE YOU, TAKE CARE OF
FANNY."

WILLIAM WAS GONE: AND THE HOME HE HAD LEFT HER IN WAS, FANNY COULD NOT
CONCEAL IT FROM HERSELF, IN ALMOST EVERY RESPECT THE VERY REVERSE OF
WHAT SHE COULD HAVE WISHED. IT WAS THE ABODE OF NOISE, DISORDER, AND
IMPROPRIETY. NOBODY WAS IN THEIR RIGHT PLACE, NOTHING WAS DONE AS IT
OUGHT TO BE. SHE COULD NOT RESPECT HER PARENTS AS SHE HAD HOPED. ON HER
FATHER, HER CONFIDENCE HAD NOT BEEN SANGUINE, BUT HE WAS MORE NEGLIGENT
OF HIS FAMILY, HIS HABITS WERE WORSE, AND HIS MANNERS COARSER, THAN
SHE HAD BEEN PREPARED FOR. HE DID NOT WANT ABILITIES BUT HE HAD NO
CURIOSITY, AND NO INFORMATION BEYOND HIS PROFESSION; HE READ ONLY
THE NEWSPAPER AND THE NAVY-LIST; HE TALKED ONLY OF THE DOCKYARD, THE
HARBOUR, SPITHEAD, AND THE MOTHERBANK; HE SWORE AND HE DRANK, HE WAS
DIRTY AND GROSS. SHE HAD NEVER BEEN ABLE TO RECALL ANYTHING APPROACHING
TO TENDERNESS IN HIS FORMER TREATMENT OF HERSELF. THERE HAD REMAINED
ONLY A GENERAL IMPRESSION OF ROUGHNESS AND LOUDNESS; AND NOW HE SCARCELY
EVER NOTICED HER, BUT TO MAKE HER THE OBJECT OF A COARSE JOKE.

HER DISAPPOINTMENT IN HER MOTHER WAS GREATER: THERE SHE HAD HOPED
MUCH, AND FOUND ALMOST NOTHING. EVERY FLATTERING SCHEME OF BEING OF
CONSEQUENCE TO HER SOON FELL TO THE GROUND. MRS. PRICE WAS NOT UNKIND;
BUT, INSTEAD OF GAINING ON HER AFFECTION AND CONFIDENCE, AND BECOMING
MORE AND MORE DEAR, HER DAUGHTER NEVER MET WITH GREATER KINDNESS FROM
HER THAN ON THE FIRST DAY OF HER ARRIVAL. THE INSTINCT OF NATURE WAS
SOON SATISFIED, AND MRS. PRICE'S ATTACHMENT HAD NO OTHER SOURCE. HER
HEART AND HER TIME WERE ALREADY QUITE FULL; SHE HAD NEITHER LEISURE NOR
AFFECTION TO BESTOW ON FANNY. HER DAUGHTERS NEVER HAD BEEN MUCH TO HER.
SHE WAS FOND OF HER SONS, ESPECIALLY OF WILLIAM, BUT BETSEY WAS THE
FIRST OF HER GIRLS WHOM SHE HAD EVER MUCH REGARDED. TO HER SHE WAS MOST
INJUDICIOUSLY INDULGENT. WILLIAM WAS HER PRIDE; BETSEY HER DARLING;
AND JOHN, RICHARD, SAM, TOM, AND CHARLES OCCUPIED ALL THE REST OF HER
MATERNAL SOLICITUDE, ALTERNATELY HER WORRIES AND HER COMFORTS. THESE
SHARED HER HEART: HER TIME WAS GIVEN CHIEFLY TO HER HOUSE AND HER
SERVANTS. HER DAYS WERE SPENT IN A KIND OF SLOW BUSTLE; ALL WAS BUSY
WITHOUT GETTING ON, ALWAYS BEHINDHAND AND LAMENTING IT, WITHOUT ALTERING
HER WAYS; WISHING TO BE AN ECONOMIST, WITHOUT CONTRIVANCE OR REGULARITY;
DISSATISFIED WITH HER SERVANTS, WITHOUT SKILL TO MAKE THEM BETTER, AND
WHETHER HELPING, OR REPRIMANDING, OR INDULGING THEM, WITHOUT ANY POWER
OF ENGAGING THEIR RESPECT.

OF HER TWO SISTERS, MRS. PRICE VERY MUCH MORE RESEMBLED LADY BERTRAM
THAN MRS. NORRIS. SHE WAS A MANAGER BY NECESSITY, WITHOUT ANY OF MRS.
NORRIS'S INCLINATION FOR IT, OR ANY OF HER ACTIVITY. HER DISPOSITION
WAS NATURALLY EASY AND INDOLENT, LIKE LADY BERTRAM'S; AND A SITUATION OF
SIMILAR AFFLUENCE AND DO-NOTHINGNESS WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH MORE SUITED
TO HER CAPACITY THAN THE EXERTIONS AND SELF-DENIALS OF THE ONE WHICH HER
IMPRUDENT MARRIAGE HAD PLACED HER IN. SHE MIGHT HAVE MADE JUST AS GOOD A
WOMAN OF CONSEQUENCE AS LADY BERTRAM, BUT MRS. NORRIS WOULD HAVE BEEN A
MORE RESPECTABLE MOTHER OF NINE CHILDREN ON A SMALL INCOME.

MUCH OF ALL THIS FANNY COULD NOT BUT BE SENSIBLE OF. SHE MIGHT SCRUPLE
TO MAKE USE OF THE WORDS, BUT SHE MUST AND DID FEEL THAT HER MOTHER WAS
A PARTIAL, ILL-JUDGING PARENT, A DAWDLE, A SLATTERN, WHO NEITHER TAUGHT
NOR RESTRAINED HER CHILDREN, WHOSE HOUSE WAS THE SCENE OF MISMANAGEMENT
AND DISCOMFORT FROM BEGINNING TO END, AND WHO HAD NO TALENT, NO
CONVERSATION, NO AFFECTION TOWARDS HERSELF; NO CURIOSITY TO KNOW HER
BETTER, NO DESIRE OF HER FRIENDSHIP, AND NO INCLINATION FOR HER COMPANY
THAT COULD LESSEN HER SENSE OF SUCH FEELINGS.

FANNY WAS VERY ANXIOUS TO BE USEFUL, AND NOT TO APPEAR ABOVE HER HOME,
OR IN ANY WAY DISQUALIFIED OR DISINCLINED, BY HER FOREIGN EDUCATION,
FROM CONTRIBUTING HER HELP TO ITS COMFORTS, AND THEREFORE SET ABOUT
WORKING FOR SAM IMMEDIATELY; AND BY WORKING EARLY AND LATE, WITH
PERSEVERANCE AND GREAT DESPATCH, DID SO MUCH THAT THE BOY WAS SHIPPED
OFF AT LAST, WITH MORE THAN HALF HIS LINEN READY. SHE HAD GREAT PLEASURE
IN FEELING HER USEFULNESS, BUT COULD NOT CONCEIVE HOW THEY WOULD HAVE
MANAGED WITHOUT HER.

SAM, LOUD AND OVERBEARING AS HE WAS, SHE RATHER REGRETTED WHEN HE WENT,
FOR HE WAS CLEVER AND INTELLIGENT, AND GLAD TO BE EMPLOYED IN ANY ERRAND
IN THE TOWN; AND THOUGH SPURNING THE REMONSTRANCES OF SUSAN, GIVEN AS
THEY WERE, THOUGH VERY REASONABLE IN THEMSELVES, WITH ILL-TIMED AND
POWERLESS WARMTH, WAS BEGINNING TO BE INFLUENCED BY FANNY'S SERVICES
AND GENTLE PERSUASIONS; AND SHE FOUND THAT THE BEST OF THE THREE YOUNGER
ONES WAS GONE IN HIM: TOM AND CHARLES BEING AT LEAST AS MANY YEARS AS
THEY WERE HIS JUNIORS DISTANT FROM THAT AGE OF FEELING AND REASON, WHICH
MIGHT SUGGEST THE EXPEDIENCY OF MAKING FRIENDS, AND OF ENDEAVOURING TO
BE LESS DISAGREEABLE. THEIR SISTER SOON DESPAIRED OF MAKING THE SMALLEST
IMPRESSION ON THEM; THEY WERE QUITE UNTAMEABLE BY ANY MEANS OF ADDRESS
WHICH SHE HAD SPIRITS OR TIME TO ATTEMPT. EVERY AFTERNOON BROUGHT A
RETURN OF THEIR RIOTOUS GAMES ALL OVER THE HOUSE; AND SHE VERY EARLY
LEARNED TO SIGH AT THE APPROACH OF SATURDAY'S CONSTANT HALF-HOLIDAY.

BETSEY, TOO, A SPOILED CHILD, TRAINED UP TO THINK THE ALPHABET HER
GREATEST ENEMY, LEFT TO BE WITH THE SERVANTS AT HER PLEASURE, AND
THEN ENCOURAGED TO REPORT ANY EVIL OF THEM, SHE WAS ALMOST AS READY TO
DESPAIR OF BEING ABLE TO LOVE OR ASSIST; AND OF SUSAN'S TEMPER SHE
HAD MANY DOUBTS. HER CONTINUAL DISAGREEMENTS WITH HER MOTHER, HER RASH
SQUABBLES WITH TOM AND CHARLES, AND PETULANCE WITH BETSEY, WERE AT LEAST
SO DISTRESSING TO FANNY THAT, THOUGH ADMITTING THEY WERE BY NO MEANS
WITHOUT PROVOCATION, SHE FEARED THE DISPOSITION THAT COULD PUSH THEM TO
SUCH LENGTH MUST BE FAR FROM AMIABLE, AND FROM AFFORDING ANY REPOSE TO
HERSELF.

SUCH WAS THE HOME WHICH WAS TO PUT MANSFIELD OUT OF HER HEAD, AND
TEACH HER TO THINK OF HER COUSIN EDMUND WITH MODERATED FEELINGS. ON THE
CONTRARY, SHE COULD THINK OF NOTHING BUT MANSFIELD, ITS BELOVED INMATES,
ITS HAPPY WAYS. EVERYTHING WHERE SHE NOW WAS IN FULL CONTRAST TO IT. THE
ELEGANCE, PROPRIETY, REGULARITY, HARMONY, AND PERHAPS, ABOVE ALL, THE
PEACE AND TRANQUILLITY OF MANSFIELD, WERE BROUGHT TO HER REMEMBRANCE
EVERY HOUR OF THE DAY, BY THE PREVALENCE OF EVERYTHING OPPOSITE TO THEM
HERE.

THE LIVING IN INCESSANT NOISE WAS, TO A FRAME AND TEMPER DELICATE AND
NERVOUS LIKE FANNY'S, AN EVIL WHICH NO SUPERADDED ELEGANCE OR HARMONY
COULD HAVE ENTIRELY ATONED FOR. IT WAS THE GREATEST MISERY OF ALL. AT
MANSFIELD, NO SOUNDS OF CONTENTION, NO RAISED VOICE, NO ABRUPT BURSTS,
NO TREAD OF VIOLENCE, WAS EVER HEARD; ALL PROCEEDED IN A REGULAR COURSE
OF CHEERFUL ORDERLINESS; EVERYBODY HAD THEIR DUE IMPORTANCE; EVERYBODY'S
FEELINGS WERE CONSULTED. IF TENDERNESS COULD BE EVER SUPPOSED WANTING,
GOOD SENSE AND GOOD BREEDING SUPPLIED ITS PLACE; AND AS TO THE LITTLE
IRRITATIONS SOMETIMES INTRODUCED BY AUNT NORRIS, THEY WERE SHORT, THEY
WERE TRIFLING, THEY WERE AS A DROP OF WATER TO THE OCEAN, COMPARED WITH
THE CEASELESS TUMULT OF HER PRESENT ABODE. HERE EVERYBODY WAS NOISY,
EVERY VOICE WAS LOUD (EXCEPTING, PERHAPS, HER MOTHER'S, WHICH RESEMBLED
THE SOFT MONOTONY OF LADY BERTRAM'S, ONLY WORN INTO FRETFULNESS).
WHATEVER WAS WANTED WAS HALLOOED FOR, AND THE SERVANTS HALLOOED OUT
THEIR EXCUSES FROM THE KITCHEN. THE DOORS WERE IN CONSTANT BANGING, THE
STAIRS WERE NEVER AT REST, NOTHING WAS DONE WITHOUT A CLATTER, NOBODY
SAT STILL, AND NOBODY COULD COMMAND ATTENTION WHEN THEY SPOKE.

IN A REVIEW OF THE TWO HOUSES, AS THEY APPEARED TO HER BEFORE THE END
OF A WEEK, FANNY WAS TEMPTED TO APPLY TO THEM DR. JOHNSON'S CELEBRATED
JUDGMENT AS TO MATRIMONY AND CELIBACY, AND SAY, THAT THOUGH MANSFIELD
PARK MIGHT HAVE SOME PAINS, PORTSMOUTH COULD HAVE NO PLEASURES.



CHAPTER XL

FANNY WAS RIGHT ENOUGH IN NOT EXPECTING TO HEAR FROM MISS CRAWFORD NOW
AT THE RAPID RATE IN WHICH THEIR CORRESPONDENCE HAD BEGUN; MARY'S NEXT
LETTER WAS AFTER A DECIDEDLY LONGER INTERVAL THAN THE LAST, BUT SHE
WAS NOT RIGHT IN SUPPOSING THAT SUCH AN INTERVAL WOULD BE FELT A GREAT
RELIEF TO HERSELF. HERE WAS ANOTHER STRANGE REVOLUTION OF MIND! SHE WAS
REALLY GLAD TO RECEIVE THE LETTER WHEN IT DID COME. IN HER PRESENT EXILE
FROM GOOD SOCIETY, AND DISTANCE FROM EVERYTHING THAT HAD BEEN WONT TO
INTEREST HER, A LETTER FROM ONE BELONGING TO THE SET WHERE HER HEART
LIVED, WRITTEN WITH AFFECTION, AND SOME DEGREE OF ELEGANCE, WAS
THOROUGHLY ACCEPTABLE. THE USUAL PLEA OF INCREASING ENGAGEMENTS WAS MADE
IN EXCUSE FOR NOT HAVING WRITTEN TO HER EARLIER; "AND NOW THAT I HAVE
BEGUN," SHE CONTINUED, "MY LETTER WILL NOT BE WORTH YOUR READING, FOR
THERE WILL BE NO LITTLE OFFERING OF LOVE AT THE END, NO THREE OR FOUR
LINES PASSIONNEES FROM THE MOST DEVOTED H. C. IN THE WORLD, FOR
HENRY IS IN NORFOLK; BUSINESS CALLED HIM TO EVERINGHAM TEN DAYS AGO, OR
PERHAPS HE ONLY PRETENDED TO CALL, FOR THE SAKE OF BEING TRAVELLING
AT THE SAME TIME THAT YOU WERE. BUT THERE HE IS, AND, BY THE BYE, HIS
ABSENCE MAY SUFFICIENTLY ACCOUNT FOR ANY REMISSNESS OF HIS SISTER'S IN
WRITING, FOR THERE HAS BEEN NO 'WELL, MARY, WHEN DO YOU WRITE TO FANNY?
IS NOT IT TIME FOR YOU TO WRITE TO FANNY?' TO SPUR ME ON. AT LAST, AFTER
VARIOUS ATTEMPTS AT MEETING, I HAVE SEEN YOUR COUSINS, 'DEAR JULIA AND
DEAREST MRS. RUSHWORTH'; THEY FOUND ME AT HOME YESTERDAY, AND WE WERE
GLAD TO SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN. WE SEEMED VERY GLAD TO SEE EACH OTHER,
AND I DO REALLY THINK WE WERE A LITTLE. WE HAD A VAST DEAL TO SAY. SHALL
I TELL YOU HOW MRS. RUSHWORTH LOOKED WHEN YOUR NAME WAS MENTIONED? I DID
NOT USE TO THINK HER WANTING IN SELF-POSSESSION, BUT SHE HAD NOT QUITE
ENOUGH FOR THE DEMANDS OF YESTERDAY. UPON THE WHOLE, JULIA WAS IN THE
BEST LOOKS OF THE TWO, AT LEAST AFTER YOU WERE SPOKEN OF. THERE WAS NO
RECOVERING THE COMPLEXION FROM THE MOMENT THAT I SPOKE OF 'FANNY,' AND
SPOKE OF HER AS A SISTER SHOULD. BUT MRS. RUSHWORTH'S DAY OF GOOD LOOKS
WILL COME; WE HAVE CARDS FOR HER FIRST PARTY ON THE 28TH. THEN SHE
WILL BE IN BEAUTY, FOR SHE WILL OPEN ONE OF THE BEST HOUSES IN WIMPOLE
STREET. I WAS IN IT TWO YEARS AGO, WHEN IT WAS LADY LASCELLE'S, AND
PREFER IT TO ALMOST ANY I KNOW IN LONDON, AND CERTAINLY SHE WILL THEN
FEEL, TO USE A VULGAR PHRASE, THAT SHE HAS GOT HER PENNYWORTH FOR HER
PENNY. HENRY COULD NOT HAVE AFFORDED HER SUCH A HOUSE. I HOPE SHE WILL
RECOLLECT IT, AND BE SATISFIED, AS WELL AS SHE MAY, WITH MOVING THE
QUEEN OF A PALACE, THOUGH THE KING MAY APPEAR BEST IN THE BACKGROUND;
AND AS I HAVE NO DESIRE TO TEASE HER, I SHALL NEVER FORCE YOUR NAME
UPON HER AGAIN. SHE WILL GROW SOBER BY DEGREES. FROM ALL THAT I HEAR
AND GUESS, BARON WILDENHEIM'S ATTENTIONS TO JULIA CONTINUE, BUT I DO NOT
KNOW THAT HE HAS ANY SERIOUS ENCOURAGEMENT. SHE OUGHT TO DO BETTER.
A POOR HONOURABLE IS NO CATCH, AND I CANNOT IMAGINE ANY LIKING IN THE
CASE, FOR TAKE AWAY HIS RANTS, AND THE POOR BARON HAS NOTHING. WHAT A
DIFFERENCE A VOWEL MAKES! IF HIS RENTS WERE BUT EQUAL TO HIS RANTS! YOUR
COUSIN EDMUND MOVES SLOWLY; DETAINED, PERCHANCE, BY PARISH DUTIES. THERE
MAY BE SOME OLD WOMAN AT THORNTON LACEY TO BE CONVERTED. I AM UNWILLING
TO FANCY MYSELF NEGLECTED FOR A YOUNG ONE. ADIEU! MY DEAR SWEET FANNY,
THIS IS A LONG LETTER FROM LONDON: WRITE ME A PRETTY ONE IN REPLY TO
GLADDEN HENRY'S EYES, WHEN HE COMES BACK, AND SEND ME AN ACCOUNT OF ALL
THE DASHING YOUNG CAPTAINS WHOM YOU DISDAIN FOR HIS SAKE."

THERE WAS GREAT FOOD FOR MEDITATION IN THIS LETTER, AND CHIEFLY FOR
UNPLEASANT MEDITATION; AND YET, WITH ALL THE UNEASINESS IT SUPPLIED, IT
CONNECTED HER WITH THE ABSENT, IT TOLD HER OF PEOPLE AND THINGS ABOUT
WHOM SHE HAD NEVER FELT SO MUCH CURIOSITY AS NOW, AND SHE WOULD
HAVE BEEN GLAD TO HAVE BEEN SURE OF SUCH A LETTER EVERY WEEK. HER
CORRESPONDENCE WITH HER AUNT BERTRAM WAS HER ONLY CONCERN OF HIGHER
INTEREST.

AS FOR ANY SOCIETY IN PORTSMOUTH, THAT COULD AT ALL MAKE AMENDS FOR
DEFICIENCIES AT HOME, THERE WERE NONE WITHIN THE CIRCLE OF HER FATHER'S
AND MOTHER'S ACQUAINTANCE TO AFFORD HER THE SMALLEST SATISFACTION: SHE
SAW NOBODY IN WHOSE FAVOUR SHE COULD WISH TO OVERCOME HER OWN SHYNESS
AND RESERVE. THE MEN APPEARED TO HER ALL COARSE, THE WOMEN ALL PERT,
EVERYBODY UNDERBRED; AND SHE GAVE AS LITTLE CONTENTMENT AS SHE RECEIVED
FROM INTRODUCTIONS EITHER TO OLD OR NEW ACQUAINTANCE. THE YOUNG LADIES
WHO APPROACHED HER AT FIRST WITH SOME RESPECT, IN CONSIDERATION OF HER
COMING FROM A BARONET'S FAMILY, WERE SOON OFFENDED BY WHAT THEY TERMED
"AIRS"; FOR, AS SHE NEITHER PLAYED ON THE PIANOFORTE NOR WORE FINE
PELISSES, THEY COULD, ON FARTHER OBSERVATION, ADMIT NO RIGHT OF
SUPERIORITY.

THE FIRST SOLID CONSOLATION WHICH FANNY RECEIVED FOR THE EVILS OF HOME,
THE FIRST WHICH HER JUDGMENT COULD ENTIRELY APPROVE, AND WHICH GAVE ANY
PROMISE OF DURABILITY, WAS IN A BETTER KNOWLEDGE OF SUSAN, AND A HOPE OF
BEING OF SERVICE TO HER. SUSAN HAD ALWAYS BEHAVED PLEASANTLY TO HERSELF,
BUT THE DETERMINED CHARACTER OF HER GENERAL MANNERS HAD ASTONISHED
AND ALARMED HER, AND IT WAS AT LEAST A FORTNIGHT BEFORE SHE BEGAN TO
UNDERSTAND A DISPOSITION SO TOTALLY DIFFERENT FROM HER OWN. SUSAN SAW
THAT MUCH WAS WRONG AT HOME, AND WANTED TO SET IT RIGHT. THAT A GIRL OF
FOURTEEN, ACTING ONLY ON HER OWN UNASSISTED REASON, SHOULD ERR IN THE
METHOD OF REFORM, WAS NOT WONDERFUL; AND FANNY SOON BECAME MORE DISPOSED
TO ADMIRE THE NATURAL LIGHT OF THE MIND WHICH COULD SO EARLY DISTINGUISH
JUSTLY, THAN TO CENSURE SEVERELY THE FAULTS OF CONDUCT TO WHICH IT LED.
SUSAN WAS ONLY ACTING ON THE SAME TRUTHS, AND PURSUING THE SAME SYSTEM,
WHICH HER OWN JUDGMENT ACKNOWLEDGED, BUT WHICH HER MORE SUPINE AND
YIELDING TEMPER WOULD HAVE SHRUNK FROM ASSERTING. SUSAN TRIED TO BE
USEFUL, WHERE SHE COULD ONLY HAVE GONE AWAY AND CRIED; AND THAT SUSAN
WAS USEFUL SHE COULD PERCEIVE; THAT THINGS, BAD AS THEY WERE, WOULD
HAVE BEEN WORSE BUT FOR SUCH INTERPOSITION, AND THAT BOTH HER MOTHER AND
BETSEY WERE RESTRAINED FROM SOME EXCESSES OF VERY OFFENSIVE INDULGENCE
AND VULGARITY.

IN EVERY ARGUMENT WITH HER MOTHER, SUSAN HAD IN POINT OF REASON THE
ADVANTAGE, AND NEVER WAS THERE ANY MATERNAL TENDERNESS TO BUY HER OFF.
THE BLIND FONDNESS WHICH WAS FOR EVER PRODUCING EVIL AROUND HER SHE HAD
NEVER KNOWN. THERE WAS NO GRATITUDE FOR AFFECTION PAST OR PRESENT TO
MAKE HER BETTER BEAR WITH ITS EXCESSES TO THE OTHERS.

ALL THIS BECAME GRADUALLY EVIDENT, AND GRADUALLY PLACED SUSAN BEFORE HER
SISTER AS AN OBJECT OF MINGLED COMPASSION AND RESPECT. THAT HER MANNER
WAS WRONG, HOWEVER, AT TIMES VERY WRONG, HER MEASURES OFTEN ILL-CHOSEN
AND ILL-TIMED, AND HER LOOKS AND LANGUAGE VERY OFTEN INDEFENSIBLE, FANNY
COULD NOT CEASE TO FEEL; BUT SHE BEGAN TO HOPE THEY MIGHT BE RECTIFIED.
SUSAN, SHE FOUND, LOOKED UP TO HER AND WISHED FOR HER GOOD OPINION; AND
NEW AS ANYTHING LIKE AN OFFICE OF AUTHORITY WAS TO FANNY, NEW AS IT
WAS TO IMAGINE HERSELF CAPABLE OF GUIDING OR INFORMING ANY ONE, SHE DID
RESOLVE TO GIVE OCCASIONAL HINTS TO SUSAN, AND ENDEAVOUR TO EXERCISE FOR
HER ADVANTAGE THE JUSTER NOTIONS OF WHAT WAS DUE TO EVERYBODY, AND WHAT
WOULD BE WISEST FOR HERSELF, WHICH HER OWN MORE FAVOURED EDUCATION HAD
FIXED IN HER.

HER INFLUENCE, OR AT LEAST THE CONSCIOUSNESS AND USE OF IT, ORIGINATED
IN AN ACT OF KINDNESS BY SUSAN, WHICH, AFTER MANY HESITATIONS OF
DELICACY, SHE AT LAST WORKED HERSELF UP TO. IT HAD VERY EARLY OCCURRED
TO HER THAT A SMALL SUM OF MONEY MIGHT, PERHAPS, RESTORE PEACE FOR
EVER ON THE SORE SUBJECT OF THE SILVER KNIFE, CANVASSED AS IT NOW WAS
CONTINUALLY, AND THE RICHES WHICH SHE WAS IN POSSESSION OF HERSELF,
HER UNCLE HAVING GIVEN HER 10 AT PARTING, MADE HER AS ABLE AS SHE WAS
WILLING TO BE GENEROUS. BUT SHE WAS SO WHOLLY UNUSED TO CONFER FAVOURS,
EXCEPT ON THE VERY POOR, SO UNPRACTISED IN REMOVING EVILS, OR BESTOWING
KINDNESSES AMONG HER EQUALS, AND SO FEARFUL OF APPEARING TO ELEVATE
HERSELF AS A GREAT LADY AT HOME, THAT IT TOOK SOME TIME TO DETERMINE
THAT IT WOULD NOT BE UNBECOMING IN HER TO MAKE SUCH A PRESENT. IT
WAS MADE, HOWEVER, AT LAST: A SILVER KNIFE WAS BOUGHT FOR BETSEY, AND
ACCEPTED WITH GREAT DELIGHT, ITS NEWNESS GIVING IT EVERY ADVANTAGE
OVER THE OTHER THAT COULD BE DESIRED; SUSAN WAS ESTABLISHED IN THE FULL
POSSESSION OF HER OWN, BETSEY HANDSOMELY DECLARING THAT NOW SHE HAD GOT
ONE SO MUCH PRETTIER HERSELF, SHE SHOULD NEVER WANT THAT AGAIN; AND
NO REPROACH SEEMED CONVEYED TO THE EQUALLY SATISFIED MOTHER, WHICH FANNY
HAD ALMOST FEARED TO BE IMPOSSIBLE. THE DEED THOROUGHLY ANSWERED: A
SOURCE OF DOMESTIC ALTERCATION WAS ENTIRELY DONE AWAY, AND IT WAS THE
MEANS OF OPENING SUSAN'S HEART TO HER, AND GIVING HER SOMETHING MORE TO
LOVE AND BE INTERESTED IN. SUSAN SHEWED THAT SHE HAD DELICACY: PLEASED
AS SHE WAS TO BE MISTRESS OF PROPERTY WHICH SHE HAD BEEN STRUGGLING FOR
AT LEAST TWO YEARS, SHE YET FEARED THAT HER SISTER'S JUDGMENT HAD BEEN
AGAINST HER, AND THAT A REPROOF WAS DESIGNED HER FOR HAVING SO STRUGGLED
AS TO MAKE THE PURCHASE NECESSARY FOR THE TRANQUILLITY OF THE HOUSE.

HER TEMPER WAS OPEN. SHE ACKNOWLEDGED HER FEARS, BLAMED HERSELF FOR
HAVING CONTENDED SO WARMLY; AND FROM THAT HOUR FANNY, UNDERSTANDING THE
WORTH OF HER DISPOSITION AND PERCEIVING HOW FULLY SHE WAS INCLINED TO
SEEK HER GOOD OPINION AND REFER TO HER JUDGMENT, BEGAN TO FEEL AGAIN THE
BLESSING OF AFFECTION, AND TO ENTERTAIN THE HOPE OF BEING USEFUL TO A
MIND SO MUCH IN NEED OF HELP, AND SO MUCH DESERVING IT. SHE GAVE ADVICE,
ADVICE TOO SOUND TO BE RESISTED BY A GOOD UNDERSTANDING, AND GIVEN SO
MILDLY AND CONSIDERATELY AS NOT TO IRRITATE AN IMPERFECT TEMPER, AND SHE
HAD THE HAPPINESS OF OBSERVING ITS GOOD EFFECTS NOT UNFREQUENTLY.
MORE WAS NOT EXPECTED BY ONE WHO, WHILE SEEING ALL THE OBLIGATION AND
EXPEDIENCY OF SUBMISSION AND FORBEARANCE, SAW ALSO WITH SYMPATHETIC
ACUTENESS OF FEELING ALL THAT MUST BE HOURLY GRATING TO A GIRL LIKE
SUSAN. HER GREATEST WONDER ON THE SUBJECT SOON BECAME--NOT THAT SUSAN
SHOULD HAVE BEEN PROVOKED INTO DISRESPECT AND IMPATIENCE AGAINST HER
BETTER KNOWLEDGE--BUT THAT SO MUCH BETTER KNOWLEDGE, SO MANY GOOD
NOTIONS SHOULD HAVE BEEN HERS AT ALL; AND THAT, BROUGHT UP IN THE MIDST
OF NEGLIGENCE AND ERROR, SHE SHOULD HAVE FORMED SUCH PROPER OPINIONS
OF WHAT OUGHT TO BE; SHE, WHO HAD HAD NO COUSIN EDMUND TO DIRECT HER
THOUGHTS OR FIX HER PRINCIPLES.

THE INTIMACY THUS BEGUN BETWEEN THEM WAS A MATERIAL ADVANTAGE TO
EACH. BY SITTING TOGETHER UPSTAIRS, THEY AVOIDED A GREAT DEAL OF THE
DISTURBANCE OF THE HOUSE; FANNY HAD PEACE, AND SUSAN LEARNED TO THINK IT
NO MISFORTUNE TO BE QUIETLY EMPLOYED. THEY SAT WITHOUT A FIRE; BUT
THAT WAS A PRIVATION FAMILIAR EVEN TO FANNY, AND SHE SUFFERED THE
LESS BECAUSE REMINDED BY IT OF THE EAST ROOM. IT WAS THE ONLY POINT OF
RESEMBLANCE. IN SPACE, LIGHT, FURNITURE, AND PROSPECT, THERE WAS
NOTHING ALIKE IN THE TWO APARTMENTS; AND SHE OFTEN HEAVED A SIGH AT THE
REMEMBRANCE OF ALL HER BOOKS AND BOXES, AND VARIOUS COMFORTS THERE. BY
DEGREES THE GIRLS CAME TO SPEND THE CHIEF OF THE MORNING UPSTAIRS, AT
FIRST ONLY IN WORKING AND TALKING, BUT AFTER A FEW DAYS, THE REMEMBRANCE
OF THE SAID BOOKS GREW SO POTENT AND STIMULATIVE THAT FANNY FOUND IT
IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO TRY FOR BOOKS AGAIN. THERE WERE NONE IN HER FATHER'S
HOUSE; BUT WEALTH IS LUXURIOUS AND DARING, AND SOME OF HERS FOUND ITS
WAY TO A CIRCULATING LIBRARY. SHE BECAME A SUBSCRIBER; AMAZED AT BEING
ANYTHING IN PROPRIA PERSONA, AMAZED AT HER OWN DOINGS IN EVERY WAY, TO
BE A RENTER, A CHUSER OF BOOKS! AND TO BE HAVING ANY ONE'S IMPROVEMENT
IN VIEW IN HER CHOICE! BUT SO IT WAS. SUSAN HAD READ NOTHING, AND FANNY
LONGED TO GIVE HER A SHARE IN HER OWN FIRST PLEASURES, AND INSPIRE A
TASTE FOR THE BIOGRAPHY AND POETRY WHICH SHE DELIGHTED IN HERSELF.

IN THIS OCCUPATION SHE HOPED, MOREOVER, TO BURY SOME OF THE
RECOLLECTIONS OF MANSFIELD, WHICH WERE TOO APT TO SEIZE HER MIND IF HER
FINGERS ONLY WERE BUSY; AND, ESPECIALLY AT THIS TIME, HOPED IT MIGHT
BE USEFUL IN DIVERTING HER THOUGHTS FROM PURSUING EDMUND TO LONDON,
WHITHER, ON THE AUTHORITY OF HER AUNT'S LAST LETTER, SHE KNEW HE WAS
GONE. SHE HAD NO DOUBT OF WHAT WOULD ENSUE. THE PROMISED NOTIFICATION
WAS HANGING OVER HER HEAD. THE POSTMAN'S KNOCK WITHIN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD
WAS BEGINNING TO BRING ITS DAILY TERRORS, AND IF READING COULD BANISH
THE IDEA FOR EVEN HALF AN HOUR, IT WAS SOMETHING GAINED.



CHAPTER XLI

A WEEK WAS GONE SINCE EDMUND MIGHT BE SUPPOSED IN TOWN, AND FANNY HAD
HEARD NOTHING OF HIM. THERE WERE THREE DIFFERENT CONCLUSIONS TO BE DRAWN
FROM HIS SILENCE, BETWEEN WHICH HER MIND WAS IN FLUCTUATION; EACH OF
THEM AT TIMES BEING HELD THE MOST PROBABLE. EITHER HIS GOING HAD BEEN
AGAIN DELAYED, OR HE HAD YET PROCURED NO OPPORTUNITY OF SEEING MISS
CRAWFORD ALONE, OR HE WAS TOO HAPPY FOR LETTER-WRITING!

ONE MORNING, ABOUT THIS TIME, FANNY HAVING NOW BEEN NEARLY FOUR WEEKS
FROM MANSFIELD, A POINT WHICH SHE NEVER FAILED TO THINK OVER AND
CALCULATE EVERY DAY, AS SHE AND SUSAN WERE PREPARING TO REMOVE, AS
USUAL, UPSTAIRS, THEY WERE STOPPED BY THE KNOCK OF A VISITOR, WHOM THEY
FELT THEY COULD NOT AVOID, FROM REBECCA'S ALERTNESS IN GOING TO THE
DOOR, A DUTY WHICH ALWAYS INTERESTED HER BEYOND ANY OTHER.

IT WAS A GENTLEMAN'S VOICE; IT WAS A VOICE THAT FANNY WAS JUST TURNING
PALE ABOUT, WHEN MR. CRAWFORD WALKED INTO THE ROOM.

GOOD SENSE, LIKE HERS, WILL ALWAYS ACT WHEN REALLY CALLED UPON; AND SHE
FOUND THAT SHE HAD BEEN ABLE TO NAME HIM TO HER MOTHER, AND RECALL HER
REMEMBRANCE OF THE NAME, AS THAT OF "WILLIAM'S FRIEND," THOUGH SHE COULD
NOT PREVIOUSLY HAVE BELIEVED HERSELF CAPABLE OF UTTERING A SYLLABLE
AT SUCH A MOMENT. THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF HIS BEING KNOWN THERE ONLY AS
WILLIAM'S FRIEND WAS SOME SUPPORT. HAVING INTRODUCED HIM, HOWEVER, AND
BEING ALL RESEATED, THE TERRORS THAT OCCURRED OF WHAT THIS VISIT MIGHT
LEAD TO WERE OVERPOWERING, AND SHE FANCIED HERSELF ON THE POINT OF
FAINTING AWAY.

WHILE TRYING TO KEEP HERSELF ALIVE, THEIR VISITOR, WHO HAD AT FIRST
APPROACHED HER WITH AS ANIMATED A COUNTENANCE AS EVER, WAS WISELY AND
KINDLY KEEPING HIS EYES AWAY, AND GIVING HER TIME TO RECOVER, WHILE HE
DEVOTED HIMSELF ENTIRELY TO HER MOTHER, ADDRESSING HER, AND ATTENDING
TO HER WITH THE UTMOST POLITENESS AND PROPRIETY, AT THE SAME TIME WITH
A DEGREE OF FRIENDLINESS, OF INTEREST AT LEAST, WHICH WAS MAKING HIS
MANNER PERFECT.

MRS. PRICE'S MANNERS WERE ALSO AT THEIR BEST. WARMED BY THE SIGHT OF
SUCH A FRIEND TO HER SON, AND REGULATED BY THE WISH OF APPEARING TO
ADVANTAGE BEFORE HIM, SHE WAS OVERFLOWING WITH GRATITUDE--ARTLESS,
MATERNAL GRATITUDE--WHICH COULD NOT BE UNPLEASING. MR. PRICE WAS OUT,
WHICH SHE REGRETTED VERY MUCH. FANNY WAS JUST RECOVERED ENOUGH TO
FEEL THAT SHE COULD NOT REGRET IT; FOR TO HER MANY OTHER SOURCES OF
UNEASINESS WAS ADDED THE SEVERE ONE OF SHAME FOR THE HOME IN WHICH HE
FOUND HER. SHE MIGHT SCOLD HERSELF FOR THE WEAKNESS, BUT THERE WAS NO
SCOLDING IT AWAY. SHE WAS ASHAMED, AND SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN YET MORE
ASHAMED OF HER FATHER THAN OF ALL THE REST.

THEY TALKED OF WILLIAM, A SUBJECT ON WHICH MRS. PRICE COULD NEVER TIRE;
AND MR. CRAWFORD WAS AS WARM IN HIS COMMENDATION AS EVEN HER HEART COULD
WISH. SHE FELT THAT SHE HAD NEVER SEEN SO AGREEABLE A MAN IN HER LIFE;
AND WAS ONLY ASTONISHED TO FIND THAT, SO GREAT AND SO AGREEABLE AS HE
WAS, HE SHOULD BE COME DOWN TO PORTSMOUTH NEITHER ON A VISIT TO THE
PORT-ADMIRAL, NOR THE COMMISSIONER, NOR YET WITH THE INTENTION OF GOING
OVER TO THE ISLAND, NOR OF SEEING THE DOCKYARD. NOTHING OF ALL THAT SHE
HAD BEEN USED TO THINK OF AS THE PROOF OF IMPORTANCE, OR THE EMPLOYMENT
OF WEALTH, HAD BROUGHT HIM TO PORTSMOUTH. HE HAD REACHED IT LATE THE
NIGHT BEFORE, WAS COME FOR A DAY OR TWO, WAS STAYING AT THE CROWN, HAD
ACCIDENTALLY MET WITH A NAVY OFFICER OR TWO OF HIS ACQUAINTANCE SINCE
HIS ARRIVAL, BUT HAD NO OBJECT OF THAT KIND IN COMING.

BY THE TIME HE HAD GIVEN ALL THIS INFORMATION, IT WAS NOT UNREASONABLE
TO SUPPOSE THAT FANNY MIGHT BE LOOKED AT AND SPOKEN TO; AND SHE WAS
TOLERABLY ABLE TO BEAR HIS EYE, AND HEAR THAT HE HAD SPENT HALF AN HOUR
WITH HIS SISTER THE EVENING BEFORE HIS LEAVING LONDON; THAT SHE HAD
SENT HER BEST AND KINDEST LOVE, BUT HAD HAD NO TIME FOR WRITING; THAT HE
THOUGHT HIMSELF LUCKY IN SEEING MARY FOR EVEN HALF AN HOUR, HAVING SPENT
SCARCELY TWENTY-FOUR HOURS IN LONDON, AFTER HIS RETURN FROM NORFOLK,
BEFORE HE SET OFF AGAIN; THAT HER COUSIN EDMUND WAS IN TOWN, HAD BEEN IN
TOWN, HE UNDERSTOOD, A FEW DAYS; THAT HE HAD NOT SEEN HIM HIMSELF, BUT
THAT HE WAS WELL, HAD LEFT THEM ALL WELL AT MANSFIELD, AND WAS TO DINE,
AS YESTERDAY, WITH THE FRASERS.

FANNY LISTENED COLLECTEDLY, EVEN TO THE LAST-MENTIONED CIRCUMSTANCE;
NAY, IT SEEMED A RELIEF TO HER WORN MIND TO BE AT ANY CERTAINTY; AND THE
WORDS, "THEN BY THIS TIME IT IS ALL SETTLED," PASSED INTERNALLY, WITHOUT
MORE EVIDENCE OF EMOTION THAN A FAINT BLUSH.

AFTER TALKING A LITTLE MORE ABOUT MANSFIELD, A SUBJECT IN WHICH HER
INTEREST WAS MOST APPARENT, CRAWFORD BEGAN TO HINT AT THE EXPEDIENCY OF
AN EARLY WALK. "IT WAS A LOVELY MORNING, AND AT THAT SEASON OF THE YEAR
A FINE MORNING SO OFTEN TURNED OFF, THAT IT WAS WISEST FOR EVERYBODY
NOT TO DELAY THEIR EXERCISE"; AND SUCH HINTS PRODUCING NOTHING, HE SOON
PROCEEDED TO A POSITIVE RECOMMENDATION TO MRS. PRICE AND HER
DAUGHTERS TO TAKE THEIR WALK WITHOUT LOSS OF TIME. NOW THEY CAME TO AN
UNDERSTANDING. MRS. PRICE, IT APPEARED, SCARCELY EVER STIRRED OUT OF
DOORS, EXCEPT OF A SUNDAY; SHE OWNED SHE COULD SELDOM, WITH HER LARGE
FAMILY, FIND TIME FOR A WALK. "WOULD SHE NOT, THEN, PERSUADE HER
DAUGHTERS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF SUCH WEATHER, AND ALLOW HIM THE PLEASURE
OF ATTENDING THEM?" MRS. PRICE WAS GREATLY OBLIGED AND VERY COMPLYING.
"HER DAUGHTERS WERE VERY MUCH CONFINED; PORTSMOUTH WAS A SAD PLACE; THEY
DID NOT OFTEN GET OUT; AND SHE KNEW THEY HAD SOME ERRANDS IN THE TOWN,
WHICH THEY WOULD BE VERY GLAD TO DO." AND THE CONSEQUENCE WAS, THAT
FANNY, STRANGE AS IT WAS--STRANGE, AWKWARD, AND DISTRESSING--FOUND
HERSELF AND SUSAN, WITHIN TEN MINUTES, WALKING TOWARDS THE HIGH STREET
WITH MR. CRAWFORD.

IT WAS SOON PAIN UPON PAIN, CONFUSION UPON CONFUSION; FOR THEY WERE
HARDLY IN THE HIGH STREET BEFORE THEY MET HER FATHER, WHOSE
APPEARANCE WAS NOT THE BETTER FROM ITS BEING SATURDAY. HE STOPT; AND,
UNGENTLEMANLIKE AS HE LOOKED, FANNY WAS OBLIGED TO INTRODUCE HIM TO MR.
CRAWFORD. SHE COULD NOT HAVE A DOUBT OF THE MANNER IN WHICH MR. CRAWFORD
MUST BE STRUCK. HE MUST BE ASHAMED AND DISGUSTED ALTOGETHER. HE MUST
SOON GIVE HER UP, AND CEASE TO HAVE THE SMALLEST INCLINATION FOR THE
MATCH; AND YET, THOUGH SHE HAD BEEN SO MUCH WANTING HIS AFFECTION TO
BE CURED, THIS WAS A SORT OF CURE THAT WOULD BE ALMOST AS BAD AS THE
COMPLAINT; AND I BELIEVE THERE IS SCARCELY A YOUNG LADY IN THE UNITED
KINGDOMS WHO WOULD NOT RATHER PUT UP WITH THE MISFORTUNE OF BEING SOUGHT
BY A CLEVER, AGREEABLE MAN, THAN HAVE HIM DRIVEN AWAY BY THE VULGARITY
OF HER NEAREST RELATIONS.

MR. CRAWFORD PROBABLY COULD NOT REGARD HIS FUTURE FATHER-IN-LAW WITH ANY
IDEA OF TAKING HIM FOR A MODEL IN DRESS; BUT (AS FANNY INSTANTLY, AND TO
HER GREAT RELIEF, DISCERNED) HER FATHER WAS A VERY DIFFERENT MAN, A
VERY DIFFERENT MR. PRICE IN HIS BEHAVIOUR TO THIS MOST HIGHLY RESPECTED
STRANGER, FROM WHAT HE WAS IN HIS OWN FAMILY AT HOME. HIS MANNERS
NOW, THOUGH NOT POLISHED, WERE MORE THAN PASSABLE: THEY WERE GRATEFUL,
ANIMATED, MANLY; HIS EXPRESSIONS WERE THOSE OF AN ATTACHED FATHER, AND
A SENSIBLE MAN; HIS LOUD TONES DID VERY WELL IN THE OPEN AIR, AND THERE
WAS NOT A SINGLE OATH TO BE HEARD. SUCH WAS HIS INSTINCTIVE COMPLIMENT
TO THE GOOD MANNERS OF MR. CRAWFORD; AND, BE THE CONSEQUENCE WHAT IT
MIGHT, FANNY'S IMMEDIATE FEELINGS WERE INFINITELY SOOTHED.

THE CONCLUSION OF THE TWO GENTLEMEN'S CIVILITIES WAS AN OFFER OF MR.
PRICE'S TO TAKE MR. CRAWFORD INTO THE DOCKYARD, WHICH MR. CRAWFORD,
DESIROUS OF ACCEPTING AS A FAVOUR WHAT WAS INTENDED AS SUCH, THOUGH
HE HAD SEEN THE DOCKYARD AGAIN AND AGAIN, AND HOPING TO BE SO MUCH THE
LONGER WITH FANNY, WAS VERY GRATEFULLY DISPOSED TO AVAIL HIMSELF OF, IF
THE MISS PRICES WERE NOT AFRAID OF THE FATIGUE; AND AS IT WAS SOMEHOW OR
OTHER ASCERTAINED, OR INFERRED, OR AT LEAST ACTED UPON, THAT THEY WERE
NOT AT ALL AFRAID, TO THE DOCKYARD THEY WERE ALL TO GO; AND BUT FOR
MR. CRAWFORD, MR. PRICE WOULD HAVE TURNED THITHER DIRECTLY, WITHOUT THE
SMALLEST CONSIDERATION FOR HIS DAUGHTERS' ERRANDS IN THE HIGH STREET. HE
TOOK CARE, HOWEVER, THAT THEY SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO GO TO THE SHOPS THEY
CAME OUT EXPRESSLY TO VISIT; AND IT DID NOT DELAY THEM LONG, FOR FANNY
COULD SO LITTLE BEAR TO EXCITE IMPATIENCE, OR BE WAITED FOR, THAT BEFORE
THE GENTLEMEN, AS THEY STOOD AT THE DOOR, COULD DO MORE THAN BEGIN UPON
THE LAST NAVAL REGULATIONS, OR SETTLE THE NUMBER OF THREE-DECKERS NOW IN
COMMISSION, THEIR COMPANIONS WERE READY TO PROCEED.

THEY WERE THEN TO SET FORWARD FOR THE DOCKYARD AT ONCE, AND THE WALK
WOULD HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED--ACCORDING TO MR. CRAWFORD'S OPINION--IN A
SINGULAR MANNER, HAD MR. PRICE BEEN ALLOWED THE ENTIRE REGULATION OF IT,
AS THE TWO GIRLS, HE FOUND, WOULD HAVE BEEN LEFT TO FOLLOW, AND KEEP UP
WITH THEM OR NOT, AS THEY COULD, WHILE THEY WALKED ON TOGETHER AT THEIR
OWN HASTY PACE. HE WAS ABLE TO INTRODUCE SOME IMPROVEMENT OCCASIONALLY,
THOUGH BY NO MEANS TO THE EXTENT HE WISHED; HE ABSOLUTELY WOULD NOT WALK
AWAY FROM THEM; AND AT ANY CROSSING OR ANY CROWD, WHEN MR. PRICE WAS
ONLY CALLING OUT, "COME, GIRLS; COME, FAN; COME, SUE, TAKE CARE OF
YOURSELVES; KEEP A SHARP LOOKOUT!" HE WOULD GIVE THEM HIS PARTICULAR
ATTENDANCE.

ONCE FAIRLY IN THE DOCKYARD, HE BEGAN TO RECKON UPON SOME HAPPY
INTERCOURSE WITH FANNY, AS THEY WERE VERY SOON JOINED BY A BROTHER
LOUNGER OF MR. PRICE'S, WHO WAS COME TO TAKE HIS DAILY SURVEY OF HOW
THINGS WENT ON, AND WHO MUST PROVE A FAR MORE WORTHY COMPANION THAN
HIMSELF; AND AFTER A TIME THE TWO OFFICERS SEEMED VERY WELL SATISFIED
GOING ABOUT TOGETHER, AND DISCUSSING MATTERS OF EQUAL AND NEVER-FAILING
INTEREST, WHILE THE YOUNG PEOPLE SAT DOWN UPON SOME TIMBERS IN THE YARD,
OR FOUND A SEAT ON BOARD A VESSEL IN THE STOCKS WHICH THEY ALL WENT TO
LOOK AT. FANNY WAS MOST CONVENIENTLY IN WANT OF REST. CRAWFORD COULD NOT
HAVE WISHED HER MORE FATIGUED OR MORE READY TO SIT DOWN; BUT HE COULD
HAVE WISHED HER SISTER AWAY. A QUICK-LOOKING GIRL OF SUSAN'S AGE WAS THE
VERY WORST THIRD IN THE WORLD: TOTALLY DIFFERENT FROM LADY BERTRAM, ALL
EYES AND EARS; AND THERE WAS NO INTRODUCING THE MAIN POINT BEFORE HER.
HE MUST CONTENT HIMSELF WITH BEING ONLY GENERALLY AGREEABLE, AND LETTING
SUSAN HAVE HER SHARE OF ENTERTAINMENT, WITH THE INDULGENCE, NOW AND
THEN, OF A LOOK OR HINT FOR THE BETTER-INFORMED AND CONSCIOUS FANNY.
NORFOLK WAS WHAT HE HAD MOSTLY TO TALK OF: THERE HE HAD BEEN SOME TIME,
AND EVERYTHING THERE WAS RISING IN IMPORTANCE FROM HIS PRESENT SCHEMES.
SUCH A MAN COULD COME FROM NO PLACE, NO SOCIETY, WITHOUT IMPORTING
SOMETHING TO AMUSE; HIS JOURNEYS AND HIS ACQUAINTANCE WERE ALL OF USE,
AND SUSAN WAS ENTERTAINED IN A WAY QUITE NEW TO HER. FOR FANNY, SOMEWHAT
MORE WAS RELATED THAN THE ACCIDENTAL AGREEABLENESS OF THE PARTIES HE HAD
BEEN IN. FOR HER APPROBATION, THE PARTICULAR REASON OF HIS GOING INTO
NORFOLK AT ALL, AT THIS UNUSUAL TIME OF YEAR, WAS GIVEN. IT HAD BEEN
REAL BUSINESS, RELATIVE TO THE RENEWAL OF A LEASE IN WHICH THE WELFARE
OF A LARGE AND--HE BELIEVED--INDUSTRIOUS FAMILY WAS AT STAKE. HE HAD
SUSPECTED HIS AGENT OF SOME UNDERHAND DEALING; OF MEANING TO BIAS
HIM AGAINST THE DESERVING; AND HE HAD DETERMINED TO GO HIMSELF, AND
THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATE THE MERITS OF THE CASE. HE HAD GONE, HAD DONE
EVEN MORE GOOD THAN HE HAD FORESEEN, HAD BEEN USEFUL TO MORE THAN HIS
FIRST PLAN HAD COMPREHENDED, AND WAS NOW ABLE TO CONGRATULATE HIMSELF
UPON IT, AND TO FEEL THAT IN PERFORMING A DUTY, HE HAD SECURED AGREEABLE
RECOLLECTIONS FOR HIS OWN MIND. HE HAD INTRODUCED HIMSELF TO SOME
TENANTS WHOM HE HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE; HE HAD BEGUN MAKING ACQUAINTANCE
WITH COTTAGES WHOSE VERY EXISTENCE, THOUGH ON HIS OWN ESTATE, HAD BEEN
HITHERTO UNKNOWN TO HIM. THIS WAS AIMED, AND WELL AIMED, AT FANNY. IT
WAS PLEASING TO HEAR HIM SPEAK SO PROPERLY; HERE HE HAD BEEN ACTING AS
HE OUGHT TO DO. TO BE THE FRIEND OF THE POOR AND THE OPPRESSED! NOTHING
COULD BE MORE GRATEFUL TO HER; AND SHE WAS ON THE POINT OF GIVING HIM AN
APPROVING LOOK, WHEN IT WAS ALL FRIGHTENED OFF BY HIS ADDING A SOMETHING
TOO POINTED OF HIS HOPING SOON TO HAVE AN ASSISTANT, A FRIEND, A GUIDE
IN EVERY PLAN OF UTILITY OR CHARITY FOR EVERINGHAM: A SOMEBODY THAT
WOULD MAKE EVERINGHAM AND ALL ABOUT IT A DEARER OBJECT THAN IT HAD EVER
BEEN YET.

SHE TURNED AWAY, AND WISHED HE WOULD NOT SAY SUCH THINGS. SHE WAS
WILLING TO ALLOW HE MIGHT HAVE MORE GOOD QUALITIES THAN SHE HAD BEEN
WONT TO SUPPOSE. SHE BEGAN TO FEEL THE POSSIBILITY OF HIS TURNING OUT
WELL AT LAST; BUT HE WAS AND MUST EVER BE COMPLETELY UNSUITED TO HER,
AND OUGHT NOT TO THINK OF HER.

HE PERCEIVED THAT ENOUGH HAD BEEN SAID OF EVERINGHAM, AND THAT IT WOULD
BE AS WELL TO TALK OF SOMETHING ELSE, AND TURNED TO MANSFIELD. HE COULD
NOT HAVE CHOSEN BETTER; THAT WAS A TOPIC TO BRING BACK HER ATTENTION AND
HER LOOKS ALMOST INSTANTLY. IT WAS A REAL INDULGENCE TO HER TO HEAR OR
TO SPEAK OF MANSFIELD. NOW SO LONG DIVIDED FROM EVERYBODY WHO KNEW THE
PLACE, SHE FELT IT QUITE THE VOICE OF A FRIEND WHEN HE MENTIONED IT,
AND LED THE WAY TO HER FOND EXCLAMATIONS IN PRAISE OF ITS BEAUTIES AND
COMFORTS, AND BY HIS HONOURABLE TRIBUTE TO ITS INHABITANTS ALLOWED HER
TO GRATIFY HER OWN HEART IN THE WARMEST EULOGIUM, IN SPEAKING OF HER
UNCLE AS ALL THAT WAS CLEVER AND GOOD, AND HER AUNT AS HAVING THE
SWEETEST OF ALL SWEET TEMPERS.

HE HAD A GREAT ATTACHMENT TO MANSFIELD HIMSELF; HE SAID SO; HE LOOKED
FORWARD WITH THE HOPE OF SPENDING MUCH, VERY MUCH, OF HIS TIME THERE;
ALWAYS THERE, OR IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD. HE PARTICULARLY BUILT UPON A VERY
HAPPY SUMMER AND AUTUMN THERE THIS YEAR; HE FELT THAT IT WOULD BE SO: HE
DEPENDED UPON IT; A SUMMER AND AUTUMN INFINITELY SUPERIOR TO THE LAST.
AS ANIMATED, AS DIVERSIFIED, AS SOCIAL, BUT WITH CIRCUMSTANCES OF
SUPERIORITY UNDESCRIBABLE.

"MANSFIELD, SOTHERTON, THORNTON LACEY," HE CONTINUED; "WHAT A SOCIETY
WILL BE COMPRISED IN THOSE HOUSES! AND AT MICHAELMAS, PERHAPS, A FOURTH
MAY BE ADDED: SOME SMALL HUNTING-BOX IN THE VICINITY OF EVERYTHING SO
DEAR; FOR AS TO ANY PARTNERSHIP IN THORNTON LACEY, AS EDMUND BERTRAM
ONCE GOOD-HUMOUREDLY PROPOSED, I HOPE I FORESEE TWO OBJECTIONS: TWO
FAIR, EXCELLENT, IRRESISTIBLE OBJECTIONS TO THAT PLAN."

FANNY WAS DOUBLY SILENCED HERE; THOUGH WHEN THE MOMENT WAS PASSED,
COULD REGRET THAT SHE HAD NOT FORCED HERSELF INTO THE ACKNOWLEDGED
COMPREHENSION OF ONE HALF OF HIS MEANING, AND ENCOURAGED HIM TO SAY
SOMETHING MORE OF HIS SISTER AND EDMUND. IT WAS A SUBJECT WHICH SHE MUST
LEARN TO SPEAK OF, AND THE WEAKNESS THAT SHRUNK FROM IT WOULD SOON BE
QUITE UNPARDONABLE.

WHEN MR. PRICE AND HIS FRIEND HAD SEEN ALL THAT THEY WISHED, OR HAD TIME
FOR, THE OTHERS WERE READY TO RETURN; AND IN THE COURSE OF THEIR WALK
BACK, MR. CRAWFORD CONTRIVED A MINUTE'S PRIVACY FOR TELLING FANNY THAT
HIS ONLY BUSINESS IN PORTSMOUTH WAS TO SEE HER; THAT HE WAS COME DOWN
FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS ON HER ACCOUNT, AND HERS ONLY, AND BECAUSE HE COULD
NOT ENDURE A LONGER TOTAL SEPARATION. SHE WAS SORRY, REALLY SORRY; AND
YET IN SPITE OF THIS AND THE TWO OR THREE OTHER THINGS WHICH SHE WISHED
HE HAD NOT SAID, SHE THOUGHT HIM ALTOGETHER IMPROVED SINCE SHE HAD SEEN
HIM; HE WAS MUCH MORE GENTLE, OBLIGING, AND ATTENTIVE TO OTHER PEOPLE'S
FEELINGS THAN HE HAD EVER BEEN AT MANSFIELD; SHE HAD NEVER SEEN HIM SO
AGREEABLE--SO NEAR BEING AGREEABLE; HIS BEHAVIOUR TO HER FATHER COULD
NOT OFFEND, AND THERE WAS SOMETHING PARTICULARLY KIND AND PROPER IN THE
NOTICE HE TOOK OF SUSAN. HE WAS DECIDEDLY IMPROVED. SHE WISHED THE NEXT
DAY OVER, SHE WISHED HE HAD COME ONLY FOR ONE DAY; BUT IT WAS NOT
SO VERY BAD AS SHE WOULD HAVE EXPECTED: THE PLEASURE OF TALKING OF
MANSFIELD WAS SO VERY GREAT!

BEFORE THEY PARTED, SHE HAD TO THANK HIM FOR ANOTHER PLEASURE, AND ONE
OF NO TRIVIAL KIND. HER FATHER ASKED HIM TO DO THEM THE HONOUR OF TAKING
HIS MUTTON WITH THEM, AND FANNY HAD TIME FOR ONLY ONE THRILL OF HORROR,
BEFORE HE DECLARED HIMSELF PREVENTED BY A PRIOR ENGAGEMENT. HE WAS
ENGAGED TO DINNER ALREADY BOTH FOR THAT DAY AND THE NEXT; HE HAD MET
WITH SOME ACQUAINTANCE AT THE CROWN WHO WOULD NOT BE DENIED; HE SHOULD
HAVE THE HONOUR, HOWEVER, OF WAITING ON THEM AGAIN ON THE MORROW, ETC.,
AND SO THEY PARTED--FANNY IN A STATE OF ACTUAL FELICITY FROM ESCAPING SO
HORRIBLE AN EVIL!

TO HAVE HAD HIM JOIN THEIR FAMILY DINNER-PARTY, AND SEE ALL THEIR
DEFICIENCIES, WOULD HAVE BEEN DREADFUL! REBECCA'S COOKERY AND REBECCA'S
WAITING, AND BETSEY'S EATING AT TABLE WITHOUT RESTRAINT, AND PULLING
EVERYTHING ABOUT AS SHE CHOSE, WERE WHAT FANNY HERSELF WAS NOT YET
ENOUGH INURED TO FOR HER OFTEN TO MAKE A TOLERABLE MEAL. SHE WAS NICE
ONLY FROM NATURAL DELICACY, BUT HE HAD BEEN BROUGHT UP IN A SCHOOL OF
LUXURY AND EPICURISM.



CHAPTER XLII

THE PRICES WERE JUST SETTING OFF FOR CHURCH THE NEXT DAY WHEN MR.
CRAWFORD APPEARED AGAIN. HE CAME, NOT TO STOP, BUT TO JOIN THEM; HE WAS
ASKED TO GO WITH THEM TO THE GARRISON CHAPEL, WHICH WAS EXACTLY WHAT HE
HAD INTENDED, AND THEY ALL WALKED THITHER TOGETHER.

THE FAMILY WERE NOW SEEN TO ADVANTAGE. NATURE HAD GIVEN THEM NO
INCONSIDERABLE SHARE OF BEAUTY, AND EVERY SUNDAY DRESSED THEM IN THEIR
CLEANEST SKINS AND BEST ATTIRE. SUNDAY ALWAYS BROUGHT THIS COMFORT TO
FANNY, AND ON THIS SUNDAY SHE FELT IT MORE THAN EVER. HER POOR MOTHER
NOW DID NOT LOOK SO VERY UNWORTHY OF BEING LADY BERTRAM'S SISTER AS SHE
WAS BUT TOO APT TO LOOK. IT OFTEN GRIEVED HER TO THE HEART TO THINK OF
THE CONTRAST BETWEEN THEM; TO THINK THAT WHERE NATURE HAD MADE SO LITTLE
DIFFERENCE, CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD HAVE MADE SO MUCH, AND THAT HER MOTHER,
AS HANDSOME AS LADY BERTRAM, AND SOME YEARS HER JUNIOR, SHOULD HAVE AN
APPEARANCE SO MUCH MORE WORN AND FADED, SO COMFORTLESS, SO SLATTERNLY,
SO SHABBY. BUT SUNDAY MADE HER A VERY CREDITABLE AND TOLERABLY
CHEERFUL-LOOKING MRS. PRICE, COMING ABROAD WITH A FINE FAMILY OF
CHILDREN, FEELING A LITTLE RESPITE OF HER WEEKLY CARES, AND ONLY
DISCOMPOSED IF SHE SAW HER BOYS RUN INTO DANGER, OR REBECCA PASS BY WITH
A FLOWER IN HER HAT.

IN CHAPEL THEY WERE OBLIGED TO DIVIDE, BUT MR. CRAWFORD TOOK CARE NOT TO
BE DIVIDED FROM THE FEMALE BRANCH; AND AFTER CHAPEL HE STILL CONTINUED
WITH THEM, AND MADE ONE IN THE FAMILY PARTY ON THE RAMPARTS.

MRS. PRICE TOOK HER WEEKLY WALK ON THE RAMPARTS EVERY FINE SUNDAY
THROUGHOUT THE YEAR, ALWAYS GOING DIRECTLY AFTER MORNING SERVICE AND
STAYING TILL DINNER-TIME. IT WAS HER PUBLIC PLACE: THERE SHE MET HER
ACQUAINTANCE, HEARD A LITTLE NEWS, TALKED OVER THE BADNESS OF THE
PORTSMOUTH SERVANTS, AND WOUND UP HER SPIRITS FOR THE SIX DAYS ENSUING.

THITHER THEY NOW WENT; MR. CRAWFORD MOST HAPPY TO CONSIDER THE MISS
PRICES AS HIS PECULIAR CHARGE; AND BEFORE THEY HAD BEEN THERE LONG,
SOMEHOW OR OTHER, THERE WAS NO SAYING HOW, FANNY COULD NOT HAVE BELIEVED
IT, BUT HE WAS WALKING BETWEEN THEM WITH AN ARM OF EACH UNDER HIS,
AND SHE DID NOT KNOW HOW TO PREVENT OR PUT AN END TO IT. IT MADE HER
UNCOMFORTABLE FOR A TIME, BUT YET THERE WERE ENJOYMENTS IN THE DAY AND
IN THE VIEW WHICH WOULD BE FELT.

THE DAY WAS UNCOMMONLY LOVELY. IT WAS REALLY MARCH; BUT IT WAS APRIL IN
ITS MILD AIR, BRISK SOFT WIND, AND BRIGHT SUN, OCCASIONALLY CLOUDED FOR
A MINUTE; AND EVERYTHING LOOKED SO BEAUTIFUL UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF SUCH
A SKY, THE EFFECTS OF THE SHADOWS PURSUING EACH OTHER ON THE SHIPS AT
SPITHEAD AND THE ISLAND BEYOND, WITH THE EVER-VARYING HUES OF THE SEA,
NOW AT HIGH WATER, DANCING IN ITS GLEE AND DASHING AGAINST THE RAMPARTS
WITH SO FINE A SOUND, PRODUCED ALTOGETHER SUCH A COMBINATION OF CHARMS
FOR FANNY, AS MADE HER GRADUALLY ALMOST CARELESS OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES
UNDER WHICH SHE FELT THEM. NAY, HAD SHE BEEN WITHOUT HIS ARM, SHE WOULD
SOON HAVE KNOWN THAT SHE NEEDED IT, FOR SHE WANTED STRENGTH FOR A TWO
HOURS' SAUNTER OF THIS KIND, COMING, AS IT GENERALLY DID, UPON A WEEK'S
PREVIOUS INACTIVITY. FANNY WAS BEGINNING TO FEEL THE EFFECT OF BEING
DEBARRED FROM HER USUAL REGULAR EXERCISE; SHE HAD LOST GROUND AS TO
HEALTH SINCE HER BEING IN PORTSMOUTH; AND BUT FOR MR. CRAWFORD AND THE
BEAUTY OF THE WEATHER WOULD SOON HAVE BEEN KNOCKED UP NOW.

THE LOVELINESS OF THE DAY, AND OF THE VIEW, HE FELT LIKE HERSELF. THEY
OFTEN STOPT WITH THE SAME SENTIMENT AND TASTE, LEANING AGAINST THE WALL,
SOME MINUTES, TO LOOK AND ADMIRE; AND CONSIDERING HE WAS NOT EDMUND,
FANNY COULD NOT BUT ALLOW THAT HE WAS SUFFICIENTLY OPEN TO THE CHARMS
OF NATURE, AND VERY WELL ABLE TO EXPRESS HIS ADMIRATION. SHE HAD A FEW
TENDER REVERIES NOW AND THEN, WHICH HE COULD SOMETIMES TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF TO LOOK IN HER FACE WITHOUT DETECTION; AND THE RESULT OF THESE LOOKS
WAS, THAT THOUGH AS BEWITCHING AS EVER, HER FACE WAS LESS BLOOMING THAN
IT OUGHT TO BE. SHE SAID SHE WAS VERY WELL, AND DID NOT LIKE TO BE
SUPPOSED OTHERWISE; BUT TAKE IT ALL IN ALL, HE WAS CONVINCED THAT HER
PRESENT RESIDENCE COULD NOT BE COMFORTABLE, AND THEREFORE COULD NOT
BE SALUTARY FOR HER, AND HE WAS GROWING ANXIOUS FOR HER BEING AGAIN AT
MANSFIELD, WHERE HER OWN HAPPINESS, AND HIS IN SEEING HER, MUST BE SO
MUCH GREATER.

"YOU HAVE BEEN HERE A MONTH, I THINK?" SAID HE.

"NO; NOT QUITE A MONTH. IT IS ONLY FOUR WEEKS TO-MORROW SINCE I LEFT
MANSFIELD."

"YOU ARE A MOST ACCURATE AND HONEST RECKONER. I SHOULD CALL THAT A
MONTH."

"I DID NOT ARRIVE HERE TILL TUESDAY EVENING."

"AND IT IS TO BE A TWO MONTHS' VISIT, IS NOT?"

"YES. MY UNCLE TALKED OF TWO MONTHS. I SUPPOSE IT WILL NOT BE LESS."

"AND HOW ARE YOU TO BE CONVEYED BACK AGAIN? WHO COMES FOR YOU?"

"I DO NOT KNOW. I HAVE HEARD NOTHING ABOUT IT YET FROM MY AUNT. PERHAPS
I MAY BE TO STAY LONGER. IT MAY NOT BE CONVENIENT FOR ME TO BE FETCHED
EXACTLY AT THE TWO MONTHS' END."

AFTER A MOMENT'S REFLECTION, MR. CRAWFORD REPLIED, "I KNOW MANSFIELD, I
KNOW ITS WAY, I KNOW ITS FAULTS TOWARDS YOU. I KNOW THE DANGER OF
YOUR BEING SO FAR FORGOTTEN, AS TO HAVE YOUR COMFORTS GIVE WAY TO THE
IMAGINARY CONVENIENCE OF ANY SINGLE BEING IN THE FAMILY. I AM AWARE
THAT YOU MAY BE LEFT HERE WEEK AFTER WEEK, IF SIR THOMAS CANNOT SETTLE
EVERYTHING FOR COMING HIMSELF, OR SENDING YOUR AUNT'S MAID FOR YOU,
WITHOUT INVOLVING THE SLIGHTEST ALTERATION OF THE ARRANGEMENTS WHICH HE
MAY HAVE LAID DOWN FOR THE NEXT QUARTER OF A YEAR. THIS WILL NOT DO. TWO
MONTHS IS AN AMPLE ALLOWANCE; I SHOULD THINK SIX WEEKS QUITE ENOUGH.
I AM CONSIDERING YOUR SISTER'S HEALTH," SAID HE, ADDRESSING HIMSELF TO
SUSAN, "WHICH I THINK THE CONFINEMENT OF PORTSMOUTH UNFAVOURABLE TO. SHE
REQUIRES CONSTANT AIR AND EXERCISE. WHEN YOU KNOW HER AS WELL AS I DO,
I AM SURE YOU WILL AGREE THAT SHE DOES, AND THAT SHE OUGHT NEVER TO
BE LONG BANISHED FROM THE FREE AIR AND LIBERTY OF THE COUNTRY. IF,
THEREFORE" (TURNING AGAIN TO FANNY), "YOU FIND YOURSELF GROWING UNWELL,
AND ANY DIFFICULTIES ARISE ABOUT YOUR RETURNING TO MANSFIELD, WITHOUT
WAITING FOR THE TWO MONTHS TO BE ENDED, THAT MUST NOT BE REGARDED
AS OF ANY CONSEQUENCE, IF YOU FEEL YOURSELF AT ALL LESS STRONG OR
COMFORTABLE THAN USUAL, AND WILL ONLY LET MY SISTER KNOW IT, GIVE HER
ONLY THE SLIGHTEST HINT, SHE AND I WILL IMMEDIATELY COME DOWN, AND TAKE
YOU BACK TO MANSFIELD. YOU KNOW THE EASE AND THE PLEASURE WITH WHICH
THIS WOULD BE DONE. YOU KNOW ALL THAT WOULD BE FELT ON THE OCCASION."

FANNY THANKED HIM, BUT TRIED TO LAUGH IT OFF.

"I AM PERFECTLY SERIOUS," HE REPLIED, "AS YOU PERFECTLY KNOW. AND I
HOPE YOU WILL NOT BE CRUELLY CONCEALING ANY TENDENCY TO INDISPOSITION.
INDEED, YOU SHALL NOT; IT SHALL NOT BE IN YOUR POWER; FOR SO LONG ONLY
AS YOU POSITIVELY SAY, IN EVERY LETTER TO MARY, 'I AM WELL,' AND I
KNOW YOU CANNOT SPEAK OR WRITE A FALSEHOOD, SO LONG ONLY SHALL YOU BE
CONSIDERED AS WELL."

FANNY THANKED HIM AGAIN, BUT WAS AFFECTED AND DISTRESSED TO A DEGREE
THAT MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR HER TO SAY MUCH, OR EVEN TO BE CERTAIN OF
WHAT SHE OUGHT TO SAY. THIS WAS TOWARDS THE CLOSE OF THEIR WALK. HE
ATTENDED THEM TO THE LAST, AND LEFT THEM ONLY AT THE DOOR OF THEIR OWN
HOUSE, WHEN HE KNEW THEM TO BE GOING TO DINNER, AND THEREFORE PRETENDED
TO BE WAITED FOR ELSEWHERE.

"I WISH YOU WERE NOT SO TIRED," SAID HE, STILL DETAINING FANNY AFTER ALL
THE OTHERS WERE IN THE HOUSE--"I WISH I LEFT YOU IN STRONGER HEALTH. IS
THERE ANYTHING I CAN DO FOR YOU IN TOWN? I HAVE HALF AN IDEA OF GOING
INTO NORFOLK AGAIN SOON. I AM NOT SATISFIED ABOUT MADDISON. I AM SURE
HE STILL MEANS TO IMPOSE ON ME IF POSSIBLE, AND GET A COUSIN OF HIS OWN
INTO A CERTAIN MILL, WHICH I DESIGN FOR SOMEBODY ELSE. I MUST COME TO AN
UNDERSTANDING WITH HIM. I MUST MAKE HIM KNOW THAT I WILL NOT BE TRICKED
ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF EVERINGHAM, ANY MORE THAN ON THE NORTH: THAT I WILL
BE MASTER OF MY OWN PROPERTY. I WAS NOT EXPLICIT ENOUGH WITH HIM BEFORE.
THE MISCHIEF SUCH A MAN DOES ON AN ESTATE, BOTH AS TO THE CREDIT OF HIS
EMPLOYER AND THE WELFARE OF THE POOR, IS INCONCEIVABLE. I HAVE A GREAT
MIND TO GO BACK INTO NORFOLK DIRECTLY, AND PUT EVERYTHING AT ONCE ON
SUCH A FOOTING AS CANNOT BE AFTERWARDS SWERVED FROM. MADDISON IS A
CLEVER FELLOW; I DO NOT WISH TO DISPLACE HIM, PROVIDED HE DOES NOT TRY
TO DISPLACE ME; BUT IT WOULD BE SIMPLE TO BE DUPED BY A MAN WHO HAS NO
RIGHT OF CREDITOR TO DUPE ME, AND WORSE THAN SIMPLE TO LET HIM GIVE ME A
HARD-HEARTED, GRIPING FELLOW FOR A TENANT, INSTEAD OF AN HONEST MAN,
TO WHOM I HAVE GIVEN HALF A PROMISE ALREADY. WOULD IT NOT BE WORSE THAN
SIMPLE? SHALL I GO? DO YOU ADVISE IT?"

"I ADVISE! YOU KNOW VERY WELL WHAT IS RIGHT."

"YES. WHEN YOU GIVE ME YOUR OPINION, I ALWAYS KNOW WHAT IS RIGHT. YOUR
JUDGMENT IS MY RULE OF RIGHT."

"OH, NO! DO NOT SAY SO. WE HAVE ALL A BETTER GUIDE IN OURSELVES, IF WE
WOULD ATTEND TO IT, THAN ANY OTHER PERSON CAN BE. GOOD-BYE; I WISH YOU A
PLEASANT JOURNEY TO-MORROW."

"IS THERE NOTHING I CAN DO FOR YOU IN TOWN?"

"NOTHING; I AM MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU."

"HAVE YOU NO MESSAGE FOR ANYBODY?"

"MY LOVE TO YOUR SISTER, IF YOU PLEASE; AND WHEN YOU SEE MY COUSIN, MY
COUSIN EDMUND, I WISH YOU WOULD BE SO GOOD AS TO SAY THAT I SUPPOSE I
SHALL SOON HEAR FROM HIM."

"CERTAINLY; AND IF HE IS LAZY OR NEGLIGENT, I WILL WRITE HIS EXCUSES
MYSELF."

HE COULD SAY NO MORE, FOR FANNY WOULD BE NO LONGER DETAINED. HE PRESSED
HER HAND, LOOKED AT HER, AND WAS GONE. HE WENT TO WHILE AWAY THE NEXT
THREE HOURS AS HE COULD, WITH HIS OTHER ACQUAINTANCE, TILL THE BEST
DINNER THAT A CAPITAL INN AFFORDED WAS READY FOR THEIR ENJOYMENT, AND
SHE TURNED IN TO HER MORE SIMPLE ONE IMMEDIATELY.

THEIR GENERAL FARE BORE A VERY DIFFERENT CHARACTER; AND COULD HE HAVE
SUSPECTED HOW MANY PRIVATIONS, BESIDES THAT OF EXERCISE, SHE ENDURED IN
HER FATHER'S HOUSE, HE WOULD HAVE WONDERED THAT HER LOOKS WERE NOT MUCH
MORE AFFECTED THAN HE FOUND THEM. SHE WAS SO LITTLE EQUAL TO REBECCA'S
PUDDINGS AND REBECCA'S HASHES, BROUGHT TO TABLE, AS THEY ALL WERE, WITH
SUCH ACCOMPANIMENTS OF HALF-CLEANED PLATES, AND NOT HALF-CLEANED KNIVES
AND FORKS, THAT SHE WAS VERY OFTEN CONSTRAINED TO DEFER HER HEARTIEST
MEAL TILL SHE COULD SEND HER BROTHERS IN THE EVENING FOR BISCUITS AND
BUNS. AFTER BEING NURSED UP AT MANSFIELD, IT WAS TOO LATE IN THE DAY
TO BE HARDENED AT PORTSMOUTH; AND THOUGH SIR THOMAS, HAD HE KNOWN ALL,
MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT HIS NIECE IN THE MOST PROMISING WAY OF BEING STARVED,
BOTH MIND AND BODY, INTO A MUCH JUSTER VALUE FOR MR. CRAWFORD'S GOOD
COMPANY AND GOOD FORTUNE, HE WOULD PROBABLY HAVE FEARED TO PUSH HIS
EXPERIMENT FARTHER, LEST SHE MIGHT DIE UNDER THE CURE.

FANNY WAS OUT OF SPIRITS ALL THE REST OF THE DAY. THOUGH TOLERABLY
SECURE OF NOT SEEING MR. CRAWFORD AGAIN, SHE COULD NOT HELP BEING LOW.
IT WAS PARTING WITH SOMEBODY OF THE NATURE OF A FRIEND; AND THOUGH, IN
ONE LIGHT, GLAD TO HAVE HIM GONE, IT SEEMED AS IF SHE WAS NOW DESERTED
BY EVERYBODY; IT WAS A SORT OF RENEWED SEPARATION FROM MANSFIELD; AND
SHE COULD NOT THINK OF HIS RETURNING TO TOWN, AND BEING FREQUENTLY WITH
MARY AND EDMUND, WITHOUT FEELINGS SO NEAR AKIN TO ENVY AS MADE HER HATE
HERSELF FOR HAVING THEM.

HER DEJECTION HAD NO ABATEMENT FROM ANYTHING PASSING AROUND HER; A
FRIEND OR TWO OF HER FATHER'S, AS ALWAYS HAPPENED IF HE WAS NOT WITH
THEM, SPENT THE LONG, LONG EVENING THERE; AND FROM SIX O'CLOCK TILL
HALF-PAST NINE, THERE WAS LITTLE INTERMISSION OF NOISE OR GROG. SHE
WAS VERY LOW. THE WONDERFUL IMPROVEMENT WHICH SHE STILL FANCIED IN MR.
CRAWFORD WAS THE NEAREST TO ADMINISTERING COMFORT OF ANYTHING WITHIN THE
CURRENT OF HER THOUGHTS. NOT CONSIDERING IN HOW DIFFERENT A CIRCLE SHE
HAD BEEN JUST SEEING HIM, NOR HOW MUCH MIGHT BE OWING TO CONTRAST, SHE
WAS QUITE PERSUADED OF HIS BEING ASTONISHINGLY MORE GENTLE AND REGARDFUL
OF OTHERS THAN FORMERLY. AND, IF IN LITTLE THINGS, MUST IT NOT BE SO IN
GREAT? SO ANXIOUS FOR HER HEALTH AND COMFORT, SO VERY FEELING AS HE NOW
EXPRESSED HIMSELF, AND REALLY SEEMED, MIGHT NOT IT BE FAIRLY SUPPOSED
THAT HE WOULD NOT MUCH LONGER PERSEVERE IN A SUIT SO DISTRESSING TO HER?



CHAPTER XLIII

IT WAS PRESUMED THAT MR. CRAWFORD WAS TRAVELLING BACK, TO LONDON, ON THE
MORROW, FOR NOTHING MORE WAS SEEN OF HIM AT MR. PRICE'S; AND TWO DAYS
AFTERWARDS, IT WAS A FACT ASCERTAINED TO FANNY BY THE FOLLOWING LETTER
FROM HIS SISTER, OPENED AND READ BY HER, ON ANOTHER ACCOUNT, WITH THE
MOST ANXIOUS CURIOSITY:--

"I HAVE TO INFORM YOU, MY DEAREST FANNY, THAT HENRY HAS BEEN DOWN TO
PORTSMOUTH TO SEE YOU; THAT HE HAD A DELIGHTFUL WALK WITH YOU TO THE
DOCKYARD LAST SATURDAY, AND ONE STILL MORE TO BE DWELT ON THE NEXT DAY,
ON THE RAMPARTS; WHEN THE BALMY AIR, THE SPARKLING SEA, AND YOUR SWEET
LOOKS AND CONVERSATION WERE ALTOGETHER IN THE MOST DELICIOUS HARMONY,
AND AFFORDED SENSATIONS WHICH ARE TO RAISE ECSTASY EVEN IN RETROSPECT.
THIS, AS WELL AS I UNDERSTAND, IS TO BE THE SUBSTANCE OF MY INFORMATION.
HE MAKES ME WRITE, BUT I DO NOT KNOW WHAT ELSE IS TO BE COMMUNICATED,
EXCEPT THIS SAID VISIT TO PORTSMOUTH, AND THESE TWO SAID WALKS, AND HIS
INTRODUCTION TO YOUR FAMILY, ESPECIALLY TO A FAIR SISTER OF YOURS, A
FINE GIRL OF FIFTEEN, WHO WAS OF THE PARTY ON THE RAMPARTS, TAKING HER
FIRST LESSON, I PRESUME, IN LOVE. I HAVE NOT TIME FOR WRITING MUCH, BUT
IT WOULD BE OUT OF PLACE IF I HAD, FOR THIS IS TO BE A MERE LETTER OF
BUSINESS, PENNED FOR THE PURPOSE OF CONVEYING NECESSARY INFORMATION,
WHICH COULD NOT BE DELAYED WITHOUT RISK OF EVIL. MY DEAR, DEAR FANNY,
IF I HAD YOU HERE, HOW I WOULD TALK TO YOU! YOU SHOULD LISTEN TO ME TILL
YOU WERE TIRED, AND ADVISE ME TILL YOU WERE STILL TIRED MORE; BUT IT IS
IMPOSSIBLE TO PUT A HUNDREDTH PART OF MY GREAT MIND ON PAPER, SO I WILL
ABSTAIN ALTOGETHER, AND LEAVE YOU TO GUESS WHAT YOU LIKE. I HAVE NO NEWS
FOR YOU. YOU HAVE POLITICS, OF COURSE; AND IT WOULD BE TOO BAD TO PLAGUE
YOU WITH THE NAMES OF PEOPLE AND PARTIES THAT FILL UP MY TIME. I OUGHT
TO HAVE SENT YOU AN ACCOUNT OF YOUR COUSIN'S FIRST PARTY, BUT I WAS
LAZY, AND NOW IT IS TOO LONG AGO; SUFFICE IT, THAT EVERYTHING WAS JUST
AS IT OUGHT TO BE, IN A STYLE THAT ANY OF HER CONNEXIONS MUST HAVE BEEN
GRATIFIED TO WITNESS, AND THAT HER OWN DRESS AND MANNERS DID HER THE
GREATEST CREDIT. MY FRIEND, MRS. FRASER, IS MAD FOR SUCH A HOUSE, AND IT
WOULD NOT MAKE ME MISERABLE. I GO TO LADY STORNAWAY AFTER EASTER;
SHE SEEMS IN HIGH SPIRITS, AND VERY HAPPY. I FANCY LORD S. IS VERY
GOOD-HUMOURED AND PLEASANT IN HIS OWN FAMILY, AND I DO NOT THINK HIM SO
VERY ILL-LOOKING AS I DID--AT LEAST, ONE SEES MANY WORSE. HE WILL NOT
DO BY THE SIDE OF YOUR COUSIN EDMUND. OF THE LAST-MENTIONED HERO, WHAT
SHALL I SAY? IF I AVOIDED HIS NAME ENTIRELY, IT WOULD LOOK SUSPICIOUS.
I WILL SAY, THEN, THAT WE HAVE SEEN HIM TWO OR THREE TIMES, AND THAT
MY FRIENDS HERE ARE VERY MUCH STRUCK WITH HIS GENTLEMANLIKE APPEARANCE.
MRS. FRASER (NO BAD JUDGE) DECLARES SHE KNOWS BUT THREE MEN IN TOWN
WHO HAVE SO GOOD A PERSON, HEIGHT, AND AIR; AND I MUST CONFESS, WHEN HE
DINED HERE THE OTHER DAY, THERE WERE NONE TO COMPARE WITH HIM, AND
WE WERE A PARTY OF SIXTEEN. LUCKILY THERE IS NO DISTINCTION OF DRESS
NOWADAYS TO TELL TALES, BUT--BUT--BUT YOURS AFFECTIONATELY."

"I HAD ALMOST FORGOT (IT WAS EDMUND'S FAULT: HE GETS INTO MY HEAD MORE
THAN DOES ME GOOD) ONE VERY MATERIAL THING I HAD TO SAY FROM HENRY AND
MYSELF--I MEAN ABOUT OUR TAKING YOU BACK INTO NORTHAMPTONSHIRE. MY DEAR
LITTLE CREATURE, DO NOT STAY AT PORTSMOUTH TO LOSE YOUR PRETTY LOOKS.
THOSE VILE SEA-BREEZES ARE THE RUIN OF BEAUTY AND HEALTH. MY POOR AUNT
ALWAYS FELT AFFECTED IF WITHIN TEN MILES OF THE SEA, WHICH THE ADMIRAL
OF COURSE NEVER BELIEVED, BUT I KNOW IT WAS SO. I AM AT YOUR SERVICE
AND HENRY'S, AT AN HOUR'S NOTICE. I SHOULD LIKE THE SCHEME, AND WE WOULD
MAKE A LITTLE CIRCUIT, AND SHEW YOU EVERINGHAM IN OUR WAY, AND PERHAPS
YOU WOULD NOT MIND PASSING THROUGH LONDON, AND SEEING THE INSIDE OF ST.
GEORGE'S, HANOVER SQUARE. ONLY KEEP YOUR COUSIN EDMUND FROM ME AT SUCH
A TIME: I SHOULD NOT LIKE TO BE TEMPTED. WHAT A LONG LETTER! ONE WORD
MORE. HENRY, I FIND, HAS SOME IDEA OF GOING INTO NORFOLK AGAIN UPON
SOME BUSINESS THAT YOU APPROVE; BUT THIS CANNOT POSSIBLY BE PERMITTED
BEFORE THE MIDDLE OF NEXT WEEK; THAT IS, HE CANNOT ANYHOW BE SPARED TILL
AFTER THE 14TH, FOR WE HAVE A PARTY THAT EVENING. THE VALUE OF A MAN
LIKE HENRY, ON SUCH AN OCCASION, IS WHAT YOU CAN HAVE NO CONCEPTION
OF; SO YOU MUST TAKE IT UPON MY WORD TO BE INESTIMABLE. HE WILL SEE THE
RUSHWORTHS, WHICH OWN I AM NOT SORRY FOR--HAVING A LITTLE CURIOSITY, AND
SO I THINK HAS HE--THOUGH HE WILL NOT ACKNOWLEDGE IT."

THIS WAS A LETTER TO BE RUN THROUGH EAGERLY, TO BE READ DELIBERATELY,
TO SUPPLY MATTER FOR MUCH REFLECTION, AND TO LEAVE EVERYTHING IN GREATER
SUSPENSE THAN EVER. THE ONLY CERTAINTY TO BE DRAWN FROM IT WAS, THAT
NOTHING DECISIVE HAD YET TAKEN PLACE. EDMUND HAD NOT YET SPOKEN. HOW
MISS CRAWFORD REALLY FELT, HOW SHE MEANT TO ACT, OR MIGHT ACT WITHOUT
OR AGAINST HER MEANING; WHETHER HIS IMPORTANCE TO HER WERE QUITE WHAT
IT HAD BEEN BEFORE THE LAST SEPARATION; WHETHER, IF LESSENED, IT WERE
LIKELY TO LESSEN MORE, OR TO RECOVER ITSELF, WERE SUBJECTS FOR ENDLESS
CONJECTURE, AND TO BE THOUGHT OF ON THAT DAY AND MANY DAYS TO COME,
WITHOUT PRODUCING ANY CONCLUSION. THE IDEA THAT RETURNED THE OFTENEST
WAS THAT MISS CRAWFORD, AFTER PROVING HERSELF COOLED AND STAGGERED BY
A RETURN TO LONDON HABITS, WOULD YET PROVE HERSELF IN THE END TOO MUCH
ATTACHED TO HIM TO GIVE HIM UP. SHE WOULD TRY TO BE MORE AMBITIOUS THAN
HER HEART WOULD ALLOW. SHE WOULD HESITATE, SHE WOULD TEASE, SHE WOULD
CONDITION, SHE WOULD REQUIRE A GREAT DEAL, BUT SHE WOULD FINALLY ACCEPT.

THIS WAS FANNY'S MOST FREQUENT EXPECTATION. A HOUSE IN TOWN--THAT, SHE
THOUGHT, MUST BE IMPOSSIBLE. YET THERE WAS NO SAYING WHAT MISS CRAWFORD
MIGHT NOT ASK. THE PROSPECT FOR HER COUSIN GREW WORSE AND WORSE. THE
WOMAN WHO COULD SPEAK OF HIM, AND SPEAK ONLY OF HIS APPEARANCE! WHAT AN
UNWORTHY ATTACHMENT! TO BE DERIVING SUPPORT FROM THE COMMENDATIONS OF
MRS. FRASER! SHE WHO HAD KNOWN HIM INTIMATELY HALF A YEAR! FANNY WAS
ASHAMED OF HER. THOSE PARTS OF THE LETTER WHICH RELATED ONLY TO MR.
CRAWFORD AND HERSELF, TOUCHED HER, IN COMPARISON, SLIGHTLY. WHETHER MR.
CRAWFORD WENT INTO NORFOLK BEFORE OR AFTER THE 14TH WAS CERTAINLY NO
CONCERN OF HERS, THOUGH, EVERYTHING CONSIDERED, SHE THOUGHT HE WOULD
GO WITHOUT DELAY. THAT MISS CRAWFORD SHOULD ENDEAVOUR TO SECURE A
MEETING BETWEEN HIM AND MRS. RUSHWORTH, WAS ALL IN HER WORST LINE OF
CONDUCT, AND GROSSLY UNKIND AND ILL-JUDGED; BUT SHE HOPED HE WOULD
NOT BE ACTUATED BY ANY SUCH DEGRADING CURIOSITY. HE ACKNOWLEDGED NO SUCH
INDUCEMENT, AND HIS SISTER OUGHT TO HAVE GIVEN HIM CREDIT FOR BETTER
FEELINGS THAN HER OWN.

SHE WAS YET MORE IMPATIENT FOR ANOTHER LETTER FROM TOWN AFTER RECEIVING
THIS THAN SHE HAD BEEN BEFORE; AND FOR A FEW DAYS WAS SO UNSETTLED BY
IT ALTOGETHER, BY WHAT HAD COME, AND WHAT MIGHT COME, THAT HER USUAL
READINGS AND CONVERSATION WITH SUSAN WERE MUCH SUSPENDED. SHE COULD
NOT COMMAND HER ATTENTION AS SHE WISHED. IF MR. CRAWFORD REMEMBERED HER
MESSAGE TO HER COUSIN, SHE THOUGHT IT VERY LIKELY, MOST LIKELY, THAT HE
WOULD WRITE TO HER AT ALL EVENTS; IT WOULD BE MOST CONSISTENT WITH HIS
USUAL KINDNESS; AND TILL SHE GOT RID OF THIS IDEA, TILL IT GRADUALLY
WORE OFF, BY NO LETTERS APPEARING IN THE COURSE OF THREE OR FOUR DAYS
MORE, SHE WAS IN A MOST RESTLESS, ANXIOUS STATE.

AT LENGTH, A SOMETHING LIKE COMPOSURE SUCCEEDED. SUSPENSE MUST BE
SUBMITTED TO, AND MUST NOT BE ALLOWED TO WEAR HER OUT, AND MAKE HER
USELESS. TIME DID SOMETHING, HER OWN EXERTIONS SOMETHING MORE, AND SHE
RESUMED HER ATTENTIONS TO SUSAN, AND AGAIN AWAKENED THE SAME INTEREST IN
THEM.

SUSAN WAS GROWING VERY FOND OF HER, AND THOUGH WITHOUT ANY OF THE EARLY
DELIGHT IN BOOKS WHICH HAD BEEN SO STRONG IN FANNY, WITH A DISPOSITION
MUCH LESS INCLINED TO SEDENTARY PURSUITS, OR TO INFORMATION FOR
INFORMATION'S SAKE, SHE HAD SO STRONG A DESIRE OF NOT APPEARING
IGNORANT, AS, WITH A GOOD CLEAR UNDERSTANDING, MADE HER A MOST
ATTENTIVE, PROFITABLE, THANKFUL PUPIL. FANNY WAS HER ORACLE. FANNY'S
EXPLANATIONS AND REMARKS WERE A MOST IMPORTANT ADDITION TO EVERY ESSAY,
OR EVERY CHAPTER OF HISTORY. WHAT FANNY TOLD HER OF FORMER TIMES DWELT
MORE ON HER MIND THAN THE PAGES OF GOLDSMITH; AND SHE PAID HER SISTER
THE COMPLIMENT OF PREFERRING HER STYLE TO THAT OF ANY PRINTED AUTHOR.
THE EARLY HABIT OF READING WAS WANTING.

THEIR CONVERSATIONS, HOWEVER, WERE NOT ALWAYS ON SUBJECTS SO HIGH AS
HISTORY OR MORALS. OTHERS HAD THEIR HOUR; AND OF LESSER MATTERS, NONE
RETURNED SO OFTEN, OR REMAINED SO LONG BETWEEN THEM, AS MANSFIELD PARK,
A DESCRIPTION OF THE PEOPLE, THE MANNERS, THE AMUSEMENTS, THE WAYS
OF MANSFIELD PARK. SUSAN, WHO HAD AN INNATE TASTE FOR THE GENTEEL AND
WELL-APPOINTED, WAS EAGER TO HEAR, AND FANNY COULD NOT BUT INDULGE
HERSELF IN DWELLING ON SO BELOVED A THEME. SHE HOPED IT WAS NOT WRONG;
THOUGH, AFTER A TIME, SUSAN'S VERY GREAT ADMIRATION OF EVERYTHING
SAID OR DONE IN HER UNCLE'S HOUSE, AND EARNEST LONGING TO GO INTO
NORTHAMPTONSHIRE, SEEMED ALMOST TO BLAME HER FOR EXCITING FEELINGS WHICH
COULD NOT BE GRATIFIED.

POOR SUSAN WAS VERY LITTLE BETTER FITTED FOR HOME THAN HER ELDER SISTER;
AND AS FANNY GREW THOROUGHLY TO UNDERSTAND THIS, SHE BEGAN TO FEEL THAT
WHEN HER OWN RELEASE FROM PORTSMOUTH CAME, HER HAPPINESS WOULD HAVE A
MATERIAL DRAWBACK IN LEAVING SUSAN BEHIND. THAT A GIRL SO CAPABLE OF
BEING MADE EVERYTHING GOOD SHOULD BE LEFT IN SUCH HANDS, DISTRESSED HER
MORE AND MORE. WERE SHE LIKELY TO HAVE A HOME TO INVITE HER TO, WHAT
A BLESSING IT WOULD BE! AND HAD IT BEEN POSSIBLE FOR HER TO RETURN MR.
CRAWFORD'S REGARD, THE PROBABILITY OF HIS BEING VERY FAR FROM OBJECTING
TO SUCH A MEASURE WOULD HAVE BEEN THE GREATEST INCREASE OF ALL HER OWN
COMFORTS. SHE THOUGHT HE WAS REALLY GOOD-TEMPERED, AND COULD FANCY HIS
ENTERING INTO A PLAN OF THAT SORT MOST PLEASANTLY.



CHAPTER XLIV

SEVEN WEEKS OF THE TWO MONTHS WERE VERY NEARLY GONE, WHEN THE ONE
LETTER, THE LETTER FROM EDMUND, SO LONG EXPECTED, WAS PUT INTO FANNY'S
HANDS. AS SHE OPENED, AND SAW ITS LENGTH, SHE PREPARED HERSELF FOR A
MINUTE DETAIL OF HAPPINESS AND A PROFUSION OF LOVE AND PRAISE TOWARDS
THE FORTUNATE CREATURE WHO WAS NOW MISTRESS OF HIS FATE. THESE WERE THE
CONTENTS--

"MY DEAR FANNY,--EXCUSE ME THAT I HAVE NOT WRITTEN BEFORE. CRAWFORD TOLD
ME THAT YOU WERE WISHING TO HEAR FROM ME, BUT I FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO
WRITE FROM LONDON, AND PERSUADED MYSELF THAT YOU WOULD UNDERSTAND MY
SILENCE. COULD I HAVE SENT A FEW HAPPY LINES, THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN
WANTING, BUT NOTHING OF THAT NATURE WAS EVER IN MY POWER. I AM RETURNED
TO MANSFIELD IN A LESS ASSURED STATE THAN WHEN I LEFT IT. MY HOPES ARE
MUCH WEAKER. YOU ARE PROBABLY AWARE OF THIS ALREADY. SO VERY FOND OF YOU
AS MISS CRAWFORD IS, IT IS MOST NATURAL THAT SHE SHOULD TELL YOU ENOUGH
OF HER OWN FEELINGS TO FURNISH A TOLERABLE GUESS AT MINE. I WILL NOT BE
PREVENTED, HOWEVER, FROM MAKING MY OWN COMMUNICATION. OUR CONFIDENCES IN
YOU NEED NOT CLASH. I ASK NO QUESTIONS. THERE IS SOMETHING SOOTHING
IN THE IDEA THAT WE HAVE THE SAME FRIEND, AND THAT WHATEVER UNHAPPY
DIFFERENCES OF OPINION MAY EXIST BETWEEN US, WE ARE UNITED IN OUR LOVE
OF YOU. IT WILL BE A COMFORT TO ME TO TELL YOU HOW THINGS NOW ARE, AND
WHAT ARE MY PRESENT PLANS, IF PLANS I CAN BE SAID TO HAVE. I HAVE BEEN
RETURNED SINCE SATURDAY. I WAS THREE WEEKS IN LONDON, AND SAW HER (FOR
LONDON) VERY OFTEN. I HAD EVERY ATTENTION FROM THE FRASERS THAT COULD BE
REASONABLY EXPECTED. I DARE SAY I WAS NOT REASONABLE IN CARRYING WITH
ME HOPES OF AN INTERCOURSE AT ALL LIKE THAT OF MANSFIELD. IT WAS HER
MANNER, HOWEVER, RATHER THAN ANY UNFREQUENCY OF MEETING. HAD SHE BEEN
DIFFERENT WHEN I DID SEE HER, I SHOULD HAVE MADE NO COMPLAINT, BUT FROM
THE VERY FIRST SHE WAS ALTERED: MY FIRST RECEPTION WAS SO UNLIKE WHAT I
HAD HOPED, THAT I HAD ALMOST RESOLVED ON LEAVING LONDON AGAIN DIRECTLY.
I NEED NOT PARTICULARISE. YOU KNOW THE WEAK SIDE OF HER CHARACTER, AND
MAY IMAGINE THE SENTIMENTS AND EXPRESSIONS WHICH WERE TORTURING ME. SHE
WAS IN HIGH SPIRITS, AND SURROUNDED BY THOSE WHO WERE GIVING ALL THE
SUPPORT OF THEIR OWN BAD SENSE TO HER TOO LIVELY MIND. I DO NOT LIKE
MRS. FRASER. SHE IS A COLD-HEARTED, VAIN WOMAN, WHO HAS MARRIED ENTIRELY
FROM CONVENIENCE, AND THOUGH EVIDENTLY UNHAPPY IN HER MARRIAGE,
PLACES HER DISAPPOINTMENT NOT TO FAULTS OF JUDGMENT, OR TEMPER, OR
DISPROPORTION OF AGE, BUT TO HER BEING, AFTER ALL, LESS AFFLUENT THAN
MANY OF HER ACQUAINTANCE, ESPECIALLY THAN HER SISTER, LADY STORNAWAY,
AND IS THE DETERMINED SUPPORTER OF EVERYTHING MERCENARY AND AMBITIOUS,
PROVIDED IT BE ONLY MERCENARY AND AMBITIOUS ENOUGH. I LOOK UPON HER
INTIMACY WITH THOSE TWO SISTERS AS THE GREATEST MISFORTUNE OF HER LIFE
AND MINE. THEY HAVE BEEN LEADING HER ASTRAY FOR YEARS. COULD SHE BE
DETACHED FROM THEM!--AND SOMETIMES I DO NOT DESPAIR OF IT, FOR THE
AFFECTION APPEARS TO ME PRINCIPALLY ON THEIR SIDE. THEY ARE VERY FOND OF
HER; BUT I AM SURE SHE DOES NOT LOVE THEM AS SHE LOVES YOU. WHEN I THINK
OF HER GREAT ATTACHMENT TO YOU, INDEED, AND THE WHOLE OF HER JUDICIOUS,
UPRIGHT CONDUCT AS A SISTER, SHE APPEARS A VERY DIFFERENT CREATURE,
CAPABLE OF EVERYTHING NOBLE, AND I AM READY TO BLAME MYSELF FOR A TOO
HARSH CONSTRUCTION OF A PLAYFUL MANNER. I CANNOT GIVE HER UP, FANNY. SHE
IS THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE WORLD WHOM I COULD EVER THINK OF AS A WIFE. IF
I DID NOT BELIEVE THAT SHE HAD SOME REGARD FOR ME, OF COURSE I SHOULD
NOT SAY THIS, BUT I DO BELIEVE IT. I AM CONVINCED THAT SHE IS NOT
WITHOUT A DECIDED PREFERENCE. I HAVE NO JEALOUSY OF ANY INDIVIDUAL. IT
IS THE INFLUENCE OF THE FASHIONABLE WORLD ALTOGETHER THAT I AM JEALOUS
OF. IT IS THE HABITS OF WEALTH THAT I FEAR. HER IDEAS ARE NOT HIGHER
THAN HER OWN FORTUNE MAY WARRANT, BUT THEY ARE BEYOND WHAT OUR INCOMES
UNITED COULD AUTHORISE. THERE IS COMFORT, HOWEVER, EVEN HERE. I COULD
BETTER BEAR TO LOSE HER BECAUSE NOT RICH ENOUGH, THAN BECAUSE OF MY
PROFESSION. THAT WOULD ONLY PROVE HER AFFECTION NOT EQUAL TO SACRIFICES,
WHICH, IN FACT, I AM SCARCELY JUSTIFIED IN ASKING; AND, IF I AM REFUSED,
THAT, I THINK, WILL BE THE HONEST MOTIVE. HER PREJUDICES, I TRUST, ARE
NOT SO STRONG AS THEY WERE. YOU HAVE MY THOUGHTS EXACTLY AS THEY ARISE,
MY DEAR FANNY; PERHAPS THEY ARE SOMETIMES CONTRADICTORY, BUT IT WILL
NOT BE A LESS FAITHFUL PICTURE OF MY MIND. HAVING ONCE BEGUN, IT IS A
PLEASURE TO ME TO TELL YOU ALL I FEEL. I CANNOT GIVE HER UP. CONNECTED
AS WE ALREADY ARE, AND, I HOPE, ARE TO BE, TO GIVE UP MARY CRAWFORD
WOULD BE TO GIVE UP THE SOCIETY OF SOME OF THOSE MOST DEAR TO ME; TO
BANISH MYSELF FROM THE VERY HOUSES AND FRIENDS WHOM, UNDER ANY OTHER
DISTRESS, I SHOULD TURN TO FOR CONSOLATION. THE LOSS OF MARY I MUST
CONSIDER AS COMPREHENDING THE LOSS OF CRAWFORD AND OF FANNY. WERE IT A
DECIDED THING, AN ACTUAL REFUSAL, I HOPE I SHOULD KNOW HOW TO BEAR IT,
AND HOW TO ENDEAVOUR TO WEAKEN HER HOLD ON MY HEART, AND IN THE COURSE
OF A FEW YEARS--BUT I AM WRITING NONSENSE. WERE I REFUSED, I MUST BEAR
IT; AND TILL I AM, I CAN NEVER CEASE TO TRY FOR HER. THIS IS THE TRUTH.
THE ONLY QUESTION IS HOW? WHAT MAY BE THE LIKELIEST MEANS? I HAVE
SOMETIMES THOUGHT OF GOING TO LONDON AGAIN AFTER EASTER, AND SOMETIMES
RESOLVED ON DOING NOTHING TILL SHE RETURNS TO MANSFIELD. EVEN NOW, SHE
SPEAKS WITH PLEASURE OF BEING IN MANSFIELD IN JUNE; BUT JUNE IS AT
A GREAT DISTANCE, AND I BELIEVE I SHALL WRITE TO HER. I HAVE NEARLY
DETERMINED ON EXPLAINING MYSELF BY LETTER. TO BE AT AN EARLY CERTAINTY
IS A MATERIAL OBJECT. MY PRESENT STATE IS MISERABLY IRKSOME. CONSIDERING
EVERYTHING, I THINK A LETTER WILL BE DECIDEDLY THE BEST METHOD OF
EXPLANATION. I SHALL BE ABLE TO WRITE MUCH THAT I COULD NOT SAY, AND
SHALL BE GIVING HER TIME FOR REFLECTION BEFORE SHE RESOLVES ON HER
ANSWER, AND I AM LESS AFRAID OF THE RESULT OF REFLECTION THAN OF AN
IMMEDIATE HASTY IMPULSE; I THINK I AM. MY GREATEST DANGER WOULD LIE IN
HER CONSULTING MRS. FRASER, AND I AT A DISTANCE UNABLE TO HELP MY OWN
CAUSE. A LETTER EXPOSES TO ALL THE EVIL OF CONSULTATION, AND WHERE
THE MIND IS ANYTHING SHORT OF PERFECT DECISION, AN ADVISER MAY, IN AN
UNLUCKY MOMENT, LEAD IT TO DO WHAT IT MAY AFTERWARDS REGRET. I MUST
THINK THIS MATTER OVER A LITTLE. THIS LONG LETTER, FULL OF MY OWN
CONCERNS ALONE, WILL BE ENOUGH TO TIRE EVEN THE FRIENDSHIP OF A FANNY.
THE LAST TIME I SAW CRAWFORD WAS AT MRS. FRASER'S PARTY. I AM MORE
AND MORE SATISFIED WITH ALL THAT I SEE AND HEAR OF HIM. THERE IS NOT A
SHADOW OF WAVERING. HE THOROUGHLY KNOWS HIS OWN MIND, AND ACTS UP TO HIS
RESOLUTIONS: AN INESTIMABLE QUALITY. I COULD NOT SEE HIM AND MY ELDEST
SISTER IN THE SAME ROOM WITHOUT RECOLLECTING WHAT YOU ONCE TOLD ME,
AND I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THEY DID NOT MEET AS FRIENDS. THERE WAS
MARKED COOLNESS ON HER SIDE. THEY SCARCELY SPOKE. I SAW HIM DRAW BACK
SURPRISED, AND I WAS SORRY THAT MRS. RUSHWORTH SHOULD RESENT ANY FORMER
SUPPOSED SLIGHT TO MISS BERTRAM. YOU WILL WISH TO HEAR MY OPINION
OF MARIA'S DEGREE OF COMFORT AS A WIFE. THERE IS NO APPEARANCE OF
UNHAPPINESS. I HOPE THEY GET ON PRETTY WELL TOGETHER. I DINED TWICE IN
WIMPOLE STREET, AND MIGHT HAVE BEEN THERE OFTENER, BUT IT IS MORTIFYING
TO BE WITH RUSHWORTH AS A BROTHER. JULIA SEEMS TO ENJOY LONDON
EXCEEDINGLY. I HAD LITTLE ENJOYMENT THERE, BUT HAVE LESS HERE. WE ARE
NOT A LIVELY PARTY. YOU ARE VERY MUCH WANTED. I MISS YOU MORE THAN I
CAN EXPRESS. MY MOTHER DESIRES HER BEST LOVE, AND HOPES TO HEAR FROM
YOU SOON. SHE TALKS OF YOU ALMOST EVERY HOUR, AND I AM SORRY TO FIND
HOW MANY WEEKS MORE SHE IS LIKELY TO BE WITHOUT YOU. MY FATHER MEANS
TO FETCH YOU HIMSELF, BUT IT WILL NOT BE TILL AFTER EASTER, WHEN HE HAS
BUSINESS IN TOWN. YOU ARE HAPPY AT PORTSMOUTH, I HOPE, BUT THIS MUST
NOT BE A YEARLY VISIT. I WANT YOU AT HOME, THAT I MAY HAVE YOUR OPINION
ABOUT THORNTON LACEY. I HAVE LITTLE HEART FOR EXTENSIVE IMPROVEMENTS
TILL I KNOW THAT IT WILL EVER HAVE A MISTRESS. I THINK I SHALL CERTAINLY
WRITE. IT IS QUITE SETTLED THAT THE GRANTS GO TO BATH; THEY LEAVE
MANSFIELD ON MONDAY. I AM GLAD OF IT. I AM NOT COMFORTABLE ENOUGH TO BE
FIT FOR ANYBODY; BUT YOUR AUNT SEEMS TO FEEL OUT OF LUCK THAT SUCH AN
ARTICLE OF MANSFIELD NEWS SHOULD FALL TO MY PEN INSTEAD OF HERS.--YOURS
EVER, MY DEAREST FANNY."

"I NEVER WILL, NO, I CERTAINLY NEVER WILL WISH FOR A LETTER AGAIN," WAS
FANNY'S SECRET DECLARATION AS SHE FINISHED THIS. "WHAT DO THEY BRING BUT
DISAPPOINTMENT AND SORROW? NOT TILL AFTER EASTER! HOW SHALL I BEAR IT?
AND MY POOR AUNT TALKING OF ME EVERY HOUR!"

FANNY CHECKED THE TENDENCY OF THESE THOUGHTS AS WELL AS SHE COULD, BUT
SHE WAS WITHIN HALF A MINUTE OF STARTING THE IDEA THAT SIR THOMAS WAS
QUITE UNKIND, BOTH TO HER AUNT AND TO HERSELF. AS FOR THE MAIN SUBJECT
OF THE LETTER, THERE WAS NOTHING IN THAT TO SOOTHE IRRITATION. SHE WAS
ALMOST VEXED INTO DISPLEASURE AND ANGER AGAINST EDMUND. "THERE IS NO
GOOD IN THIS DELAY," SAID SHE. "WHY IS NOT IT SETTLED? HE IS BLINDED,
AND NOTHING WILL OPEN HIS EYES; NOTHING CAN, AFTER HAVING HAD TRUTHS
BEFORE HIM SO LONG IN VAIN. HE WILL MARRY HER, AND BE POOR AND
MISERABLE. GOD GRANT THAT HER INFLUENCE DO NOT MAKE HIM CEASE TO BE
RESPECTABLE!" SHE LOOKED OVER THE LETTER AGAIN. "'SO VERY FOND OF ME!'
'TIS NONSENSE ALL. SHE LOVES NOBODY BUT HERSELF AND HER BROTHER. HER
FRIENDS LEADING HER ASTRAY FOR YEARS! SHE IS QUITE AS LIKELY TO HAVE LED
THEM ASTRAY. THEY HAVE ALL, PERHAPS, BEEN CORRUPTING ONE ANOTHER; BUT
IF THEY ARE SO MUCH FONDER OF HER THAN SHE IS OF THEM, SHE IS THE LESS
LIKELY TO HAVE BEEN HURT, EXCEPT BY THEIR FLATTERY. 'THE ONLY WOMAN IN
THE WORLD WHOM HE COULD EVER THINK OF AS A WIFE.' I FIRMLY BELIEVE IT.
IT IS AN ATTACHMENT TO GOVERN HIS WHOLE LIFE. ACCEPTED OR REFUSED, HIS
HEART IS WEDDED TO HER FOR EVER. 'THE LOSS OF MARY I MUST CONSIDER AS
COMPREHENDING THE LOSS OF CRAWFORD AND FANNY.' EDMUND, YOU DO NOT KNOW
ME. THE FAMILIES WOULD NEVER BE CONNECTED IF YOU DID NOT CONNECT
THEM! OH! WRITE, WRITE. FINISH IT AT ONCE. LET THERE BE AN END OF THIS
SUSPENSE. FIX, COMMIT, CONDEMN YOURSELF."

SUCH SENSATIONS, HOWEVER, WERE TOO NEAR AKIN TO RESENTMENT TO BE LONG
GUIDING FANNY'S SOLILOQUIES. SHE WAS SOON MORE SOFTENED AND SORROWFUL.
HIS WARM REGARD, HIS KIND EXPRESSIONS, HIS CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT,
TOUCHED HER STRONGLY. HE WAS ONLY TOO GOOD TO EVERYBODY. IT WAS A
LETTER, IN SHORT, WHICH SHE WOULD NOT BUT HAVE HAD FOR THE WORLD, AND
WHICH COULD NEVER BE VALUED ENOUGH. THIS WAS THE END OF IT.

EVERYBODY AT ALL ADDICTED TO LETTER-WRITING, WITHOUT HAVING MUCH TO SAY,
WHICH WILL INCLUDE A LARGE PROPORTION OF THE FEMALE WORLD AT LEAST, MUST
FEEL WITH LADY BERTRAM THAT SHE WAS OUT OF LUCK IN HAVING SUCH A CAPITAL
PIECE OF MANSFIELD NEWS AS THE CERTAINTY OF THE GRANTS GOING TO BATH,
OCCUR AT A TIME WHEN SHE COULD MAKE NO ADVANTAGE OF IT, AND WILL ADMIT
THAT IT MUST HAVE BEEN VERY MORTIFYING TO HER TO SEE IT FALL TO THE
SHARE OF HER THANKLESS SON, AND TREATED AS CONCISELY AS POSSIBLE AT THE
END OF A LONG LETTER, INSTEAD OF HAVING IT TO SPREAD OVER THE LARGEST
PART OF A PAGE OF HER OWN. FOR THOUGH LADY BERTRAM RATHER SHONE IN THE
EPISTOLARY LINE, HAVING EARLY IN HER MARRIAGE, FROM THE WANT OF OTHER
EMPLOYMENT, AND THE CIRCUMSTANCE OF SIR THOMAS'S BEING IN PARLIAMENT,
GOT INTO THE WAY OF MAKING AND KEEPING CORRESPONDENTS, AND FORMED FOR
HERSELF A VERY CREDITABLE, COMMON-PLACE, AMPLIFYING STYLE, SO THAT A
VERY LITTLE MATTER WAS ENOUGH FOR HER: SHE COULD NOT DO ENTIRELY WITHOUT
ANY; SHE MUST HAVE SOMETHING TO WRITE ABOUT, EVEN TO HER NIECE; AND
BEING SO SOON TO LOSE ALL THE BENEFIT OF DR. GRANT'S GOUTY SYMPTOMS AND
MRS. GRANT'S MORNING CALLS, IT WAS VERY HARD UPON HER TO BE DEPRIVED OF
ONE OF THE LAST EPISTOLARY USES SHE COULD PUT THEM TO.

THERE WAS A RICH AMENDS, HOWEVER, PREPARING FOR HER. LADY BERTRAM'S
HOUR OF GOOD LUCK CAME. WITHIN A FEW DAYS FROM THE RECEIPT OF EDMUND'S
LETTER, FANNY HAD ONE FROM HER AUNT, BEGINNING THUS--

"MY DEAR FANNY,--I TAKE UP MY PEN TO COMMUNICATE SOME VERY ALARMING
INTELLIGENCE, WHICH I MAKE NO DOUBT WILL GIVE YOU MUCH CONCERN".

THIS WAS A GREAT DEAL BETTER THAN TO HAVE TO TAKE UP THE PEN TO ACQUAINT
HER WITH ALL THE PARTICULARS OF THE GRANTS' INTENDED JOURNEY, FOR THE
PRESENT INTELLIGENCE WAS OF A NATURE TO PROMISE OCCUPATION FOR THE PEN
FOR MANY DAYS TO COME, BEING NO LESS THAN THE DANGEROUS ILLNESS OF HER
ELDEST SON, OF WHICH THEY HAD RECEIVED NOTICE BY EXPRESS A FEW HOURS
BEFORE.

TOM HAD GONE FROM LONDON WITH A PARTY OF YOUNG MEN TO NEWMARKET, WHERE
A NEGLECTED FALL AND A GOOD DEAL OF DRINKING HAD BROUGHT ON A FEVER; AND
WHEN THE PARTY BROKE UP, BEING UNABLE TO MOVE, HAD BEEN LEFT BY HIMSELF
AT THE HOUSE OF ONE OF THESE YOUNG MEN TO THE COMFORTS OF SICKNESS AND
SOLITUDE, AND THE ATTENDANCE ONLY OF SERVANTS. INSTEAD OF BEING SOON
WELL ENOUGH TO FOLLOW HIS FRIENDS, AS HE HAD THEN HOPED, HIS DISORDER
INCREASED CONSIDERABLY, AND IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE HE THOUGHT SO ILL OF
HIMSELF AS TO BE AS READY AS HIS PHYSICIAN TO HAVE A LETTER DESPATCHED
TO MANSFIELD.

"THIS DISTRESSING INTELLIGENCE, AS YOU MAY SUPPOSE," OBSERVED
HER LADYSHIP, AFTER GIVING THE SUBSTANCE OF IT, "HAS AGITATED US
EXCEEDINGLY, AND WE CANNOT PREVENT OURSELVES FROM BEING GREATLY ALARMED
AND APPREHENSIVE FOR THE POOR INVALID, WHOSE STATE SIR THOMAS FEARS
MAY BE VERY CRITICAL; AND EDMUND KINDLY PROPOSES ATTENDING HIS BROTHER
IMMEDIATELY, BUT I AM HAPPY TO ADD THAT SIR THOMAS WILL NOT LEAVE ME ON
THIS DISTRESSING OCCASION, AS IT WOULD BE TOO TRYING FOR ME. WE SHALL
GREATLY MISS EDMUND IN OUR SMALL CIRCLE, BUT I TRUST AND HOPE HE
WILL FIND THE POOR INVALID IN A LESS ALARMING STATE THAN MIGHT BE
APPREHENDED, AND THAT HE WILL BE ABLE TO BRING HIM TO MANSFIELD SHORTLY,
WHICH SIR THOMAS PROPOSES SHOULD BE DONE, AND THINKS BEST ON EVERY
ACCOUNT, AND I FLATTER MYSELF THE POOR SUFFERER WILL SOON BE ABLE TO
BEAR THE REMOVAL WITHOUT MATERIAL INCONVENIENCE OR INJURY. AS I
HAVE LITTLE DOUBT OF YOUR FEELING FOR US, MY DEAR FANNY, UNDER THESE
DISTRESSING CIRCUMSTANCES, I WILL WRITE AGAIN VERY SOON."

FANNY'S FEELINGS ON THE OCCASION WERE INDEED CONSIDERABLY MORE WARM AND
GENUINE THAN HER AUNT'S STYLE OF WRITING. SHE FELT TRULY FOR THEM ALL.
TOM DANGEROUSLY ILL, EDMUND GONE TO ATTEND HIM, AND THE SADLY SMALL
PARTY REMAINING AT MANSFIELD, WERE CARES TO SHUT OUT EVERY OTHER CARE,
OR ALMOST EVERY OTHER. SHE COULD JUST FIND SELFISHNESS ENOUGH TO WONDER
WHETHER EDMUND HAD WRITTEN TO MISS CRAWFORD BEFORE THIS SUMMONS CAME,
BUT NO SENTIMENT DWELT LONG WITH HER THAT WAS NOT PURELY AFFECTIONATE
AND DISINTERESTEDLY ANXIOUS. HER AUNT DID NOT NEGLECT HER: SHE WROTE
AGAIN AND AGAIN; THEY WERE RECEIVING FREQUENT ACCOUNTS FROM EDMUND,
AND THESE ACCOUNTS WERE AS REGULARLY TRANSMITTED TO FANNY, IN THE SAME
DIFFUSE STYLE, AND THE SAME MEDLEY OF TRUSTS, HOPES, AND FEARS, ALL
FOLLOWING AND PRODUCING EACH OTHER AT HAPHAZARD. IT WAS A SORT OF
PLAYING AT BEING FRIGHTENED. THE SUFFERINGS WHICH LADY BERTRAM DID NOT
SEE HAD LITTLE POWER OVER HER FANCY; AND SHE WROTE VERY COMFORTABLY
ABOUT AGITATION, AND ANXIETY, AND POOR INVALIDS, TILL TOM WAS ACTUALLY
CONVEYED TO MANSFIELD, AND HER OWN EYES HAD BEHELD HIS ALTERED
APPEARANCE. THEN A LETTER WHICH SHE HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY PREPARING FOR
FANNY WAS FINISHED IN A DIFFERENT STYLE, IN THE LANGUAGE OF REAL FEELING
AND ALARM; THEN SHE WROTE AS SHE MIGHT HAVE SPOKEN. "HE IS JUST COME, MY
DEAR FANNY, AND IS TAKEN UPSTAIRS; AND I AM SO SHOCKED TO SEE HIM, THAT
I DO NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO. I AM SURE HE HAS BEEN VERY ILL. POOR TOM! I AM
QUITE GRIEVED FOR HIM, AND VERY MUCH FRIGHTENED, AND SO IS SIR THOMAS;
AND HOW GLAD I SHOULD BE IF YOU WERE HERE TO COMFORT ME. BUT SIR
THOMAS HOPES HE WILL BE BETTER TO-MORROW, AND SAYS WE MUST CONSIDER HIS
JOURNEY."

THE REAL SOLICITUDE NOW AWAKENED IN THE MATERNAL BOSOM WAS NOT
SOON OVER. TOM'S EXTREME IMPATIENCE TO BE REMOVED TO MANSFIELD, AND
EXPERIENCE THOSE COMFORTS OF HOME AND FAMILY WHICH HAD BEEN LITTLE
THOUGHT OF IN UNINTERRUPTED HEALTH, HAD PROBABLY INDUCED HIS BEING
CONVEYED THITHER TOO EARLY, AS A RETURN OF FEVER CAME ON, AND FOR A WEEK
HE WAS IN A MORE ALARMING STATE THAN EVER. THEY WERE ALL VERY SERIOUSLY
FRIGHTENED. LADY BERTRAM WROTE HER DAILY TERRORS TO HER NIECE, WHO
MIGHT NOW BE SAID TO LIVE UPON LETTERS, AND PASS ALL HER TIME BETWEEN
SUFFERING FROM THAT OF TO-DAY AND LOOKING FORWARD TO TO-MORROW'S.
WITHOUT ANY PARTICULAR AFFECTION FOR HER ELDEST COUSIN, HER TENDERNESS
OF HEART MADE HER FEEL THAT SHE COULD NOT SPARE HIM, AND THE PURITY OF
HER PRINCIPLES ADDED YET A KEENER SOLICITUDE, WHEN SHE CONSIDERED HOW
LITTLE USEFUL, HOW LITTLE SELF-DENYING HIS LIFE HAD (APPARENTLY) BEEN.

SUSAN WAS HER ONLY COMPANION AND LISTENER ON THIS, AS ON MORE COMMON
OCCASIONS. SUSAN WAS ALWAYS READY TO HEAR AND TO SYMPATHISE. NOBODY ELSE
COULD BE INTERESTED IN SO REMOTE AN EVIL AS ILLNESS IN A FAMILY ABOVE AN
HUNDRED MILES OFF; NOT EVEN MRS. PRICE, BEYOND A BRIEF QUESTION OR TWO,
IF SHE SAW HER DAUGHTER WITH A LETTER IN HER HAND, AND NOW AND THEN THE
QUIET OBSERVATION OF, "MY POOR SISTER BERTRAM MUST BE IN A GREAT DEAL OF
TROUBLE."

SO LONG DIVIDED AND SO DIFFERENTLY SITUATED, THE TIES OF BLOOD WERE
LITTLE MORE THAN NOTHING. AN ATTACHMENT, ORIGINALLY AS TRANQUIL AS THEIR
TEMPERS, WAS NOW BECOME A MERE NAME. MRS. PRICE DID QUITE AS MUCH FOR
LADY BERTRAM AS LADY BERTRAM WOULD HAVE DONE FOR MRS. PRICE. THREE OR
FOUR PRICES MIGHT HAVE BEEN SWEPT AWAY, ANY OR ALL EXCEPT FANNY AND
WILLIAM, AND LADY BERTRAM WOULD HAVE THOUGHT LITTLE ABOUT IT; OR PERHAPS
MIGHT HAVE CAUGHT FROM MRS. NORRIS'S LIPS THE CANT OF ITS BEING A VERY
HAPPY THING AND A GREAT BLESSING TO THEIR POOR DEAR SISTER PRICE TO HAVE
THEM SO WELL PROVIDED FOR.



CHAPTER XLV

AT ABOUT THE WEEK'S END FROM HIS RETURN TO MANSFIELD, TOM'S IMMEDIATE
DANGER WAS OVER, AND HE WAS SO FAR PRONOUNCED SAFE AS TO MAKE HIS MOTHER
PERFECTLY EASY; FOR BEING NOW USED TO THE SIGHT OF HIM IN HIS SUFFERING,
HELPLESS STATE, AND HEARING ONLY THE BEST, AND NEVER THINKING BEYOND
WHAT SHE HEARD, WITH NO DISPOSITION FOR ALARM AND NO APTITUDE AT A HINT,
LADY BERTRAM WAS THE HAPPIEST SUBJECT IN THE WORLD FOR A LITTLE MEDICAL
IMPOSITION. THE FEVER WAS SUBDUED; THE FEVER HAD BEEN HIS COMPLAINT;
OF COURSE HE WOULD SOON BE WELL AGAIN. LADY BERTRAM COULD THINK NOTHING
LESS, AND FANNY SHARED HER AUNT'S SECURITY, TILL SHE RECEIVED A FEW
LINES FROM EDMUND, WRITTEN PURPOSELY TO GIVE HER A CLEARER IDEA OF HIS
BROTHER'S SITUATION, AND ACQUAINT HER WITH THE APPREHENSIONS WHICH
HE AND HIS FATHER HAD IMBIBED FROM THE PHYSICIAN WITH RESPECT TO SOME
STRONG HECTIC SYMPTOMS, WHICH SEEMED TO SEIZE THE FRAME ON THE DEPARTURE
OF THE FEVER. THEY JUDGED IT BEST THAT LADY BERTRAM SHOULD NOT BE
HARASSED BY ALARMS WHICH, IT WAS TO BE HOPED, WOULD PROVE UNFOUNDED;
BUT THERE WAS NO REASON WHY FANNY SHOULD NOT KNOW THE TRUTH. THEY WERE
APPREHENSIVE FOR HIS LUNGS.

A VERY FEW LINES FROM EDMUND SHEWED HER THE PATIENT AND THE SICKROOM
IN A JUSTER AND STRONGER LIGHT THAN ALL LADY BERTRAM'S SHEETS OF PAPER
COULD DO. THERE WAS HARDLY ANY ONE IN THE HOUSE WHO MIGHT NOT HAVE
DESCRIBED, FROM PERSONAL OBSERVATION, BETTER THAN HERSELF; NOT ONE WHO
WAS NOT MORE USEFUL AT TIMES TO HER SON. SHE COULD DO NOTHING BUT GLIDE
IN QUIETLY AND LOOK AT HIM; BUT WHEN ABLE TO TALK OR BE TALKED TO, OR
READ TO, EDMUND WAS THE COMPANION HE PREFERRED. HIS AUNT WORRIED HIM BY
HER CARES, AND SIR THOMAS KNEW NOT HOW TO BRING DOWN HIS CONVERSATION OR
HIS VOICE TO THE LEVEL OF IRRITATION AND FEEBLENESS. EDMUND WAS ALL IN
ALL. FANNY WOULD CERTAINLY BELIEVE HIM SO AT LEAST, AND MUST FIND THAT
HER ESTIMATION OF HIM WAS HIGHER THAN EVER WHEN HE APPEARED AS THE
ATTENDANT, SUPPORTER, CHEERER OF A SUFFERING BROTHER. THERE WAS NOT ONLY
THE DEBILITY OF RECENT ILLNESS TO ASSIST: THERE WAS ALSO, AS SHE NOW
LEARNT, NERVES MUCH AFFECTED, SPIRITS MUCH DEPRESSED TO CALM AND RAISE,
AND HER OWN IMAGINATION ADDED THAT THERE MUST BE A MIND TO BE PROPERLY
GUIDED.

THE FAMILY WERE NOT CONSUMPTIVE, AND SHE WAS MORE INCLINED TO HOPE THAN
FEAR FOR HER COUSIN, EXCEPT WHEN SHE THOUGHT OF MISS CRAWFORD; BUT MISS
CRAWFORD GAVE HER THE IDEA OF BEING THE CHILD OF GOOD LUCK, AND TO HER
SELFISHNESS AND VANITY IT WOULD BE GOOD LUCK TO HAVE EDMUND THE ONLY
SON.

EVEN IN THE SICK CHAMBER THE FORTUNATE MARY WAS NOT FORGOTTEN. EDMUND'S
LETTER HAD THIS POSTSCRIPT. "ON THE SUBJECT OF MY LAST, I HAD ACTUALLY
BEGUN A LETTER WHEN CALLED AWAY BY TOM'S ILLNESS, BUT I HAVE NOW CHANGED
MY MIND, AND FEAR TO TRUST THE INFLUENCE OF FRIENDS. WHEN TOM IS BETTER,
I SHALL GO."

SUCH WAS THE STATE OF MANSFIELD, AND SO IT CONTINUED, WITH SCARCELY ANY
CHANGE, TILL EASTER. A LINE OCCASIONALLY ADDED BY EDMUND TO HIS
MOTHER'S LETTER WAS ENOUGH FOR FANNY'S INFORMATION. TOM'S AMENDMENT WAS
ALARMINGLY SLOW.

EASTER CAME PARTICULARLY LATE THIS YEAR, AS FANNY HAD MOST SORROWFULLY
CONSIDERED, ON FIRST LEARNING THAT SHE HAD NO CHANCE OF LEAVING
PORTSMOUTH TILL AFTER IT. IT CAME, AND SHE HAD YET HEARD NOTHING OF HER
RETURN--NOTHING EVEN OF THE GOING TO LONDON, WHICH WAS TO PRECEDE
HER RETURN. HER AUNT OFTEN EXPRESSED A WISH FOR HER, BUT THERE WAS NO
NOTICE, NO MESSAGE FROM THE UNCLE ON WHOM ALL DEPENDED. SHE SUPPOSED
HE COULD NOT YET LEAVE HIS SON, BUT IT WAS A CRUEL, A TERRIBLE DELAY
TO HER. THE END OF APRIL WAS COMING ON; IT WOULD SOON BE ALMOST THREE
MONTHS, INSTEAD OF TWO, THAT SHE HAD BEEN ABSENT FROM THEM ALL, AND THAT
HER DAYS HAD BEEN PASSING IN A STATE OF PENANCE, WHICH SHE LOVED THEM
TOO WELL TO HOPE THEY WOULD THOROUGHLY UNDERSTAND; AND WHO COULD YET SAY
WHEN THERE MIGHT BE LEISURE TO THINK OF OR FETCH HER?

HER EAGERNESS, HER IMPATIENCE, HER LONGINGS TO BE WITH THEM, WERE SUCH
AS TO BRING A LINE OR TWO OF COWPER'S TIROCINIUM FOR EVER BEFORE HER.
"WITH WHAT INTENSE DESIRE SHE WANTS HER HOME," WAS CONTINUALLY ON HER
TONGUE, AS THE TRUEST DESCRIPTION OF A YEARNING WHICH SHE COULD NOT
SUPPOSE ANY SCHOOLBOY'S BOSOM TO FEEL MORE KEENLY.

WHEN SHE HAD BEEN COMING TO PORTSMOUTH, SHE HAD LOVED TO CALL IT HER
HOME, HAD BEEN FOND OF SAYING THAT SHE WAS GOING HOME; THE WORD HAD
BEEN VERY DEAR TO HER, AND SO IT STILL WAS, BUT IT MUST BE APPLIED TO
MANSFIELD. THAT WAS NOW THE HOME. PORTSMOUTH WAS PORTSMOUTH; MANSFIELD
WAS HOME. THEY HAD BEEN LONG SO ARRANGED IN THE INDULGENCE OF HER SECRET
MEDITATIONS, AND NOTHING WAS MORE CONSOLATORY TO HER THAN TO FIND HER
AUNT USING THE SAME LANGUAGE: "I CANNOT BUT SAY I MUCH REGRET YOUR BEING
FROM HOME AT THIS DISTRESSING TIME, SO VERY TRYING TO MY SPIRITS. I
TRUST AND HOPE, AND SINCERELY WISH YOU MAY NEVER BE ABSENT FROM HOME SO
LONG AGAIN," WERE MOST DELIGHTFUL SENTENCES TO HER. STILL, HOWEVER, IT
WAS HER PRIVATE REGALE. DELICACY TO HER PARENTS MADE HER CAREFUL NOT TO
BETRAY SUCH A PREFERENCE OF HER UNCLE'S HOUSE. IT WAS ALWAYS: "WHEN I GO
BACK INTO NORTHAMPTONSHIRE, OR WHEN I RETURN TO MANSFIELD, I SHALL DO
SO AND SO." FOR A GREAT WHILE IT WAS SO, BUT AT LAST THE LONGING GREW
STRONGER, IT OVERTHREW CAUTION, AND SHE FOUND HERSELF TALKING OF WHAT
SHE SHOULD DO WHEN SHE WENT HOME BEFORE SHE WAS AWARE. SHE REPROACHED
HERSELF, COLOURED, AND LOOKED FEARFULLY TOWARDS HER FATHER AND MOTHER.
SHE NEED NOT HAVE BEEN UNEASY. THERE WAS NO SIGN OF DISPLEASURE, OR EVEN
OF HEARING HER. THEY WERE PERFECTLY FREE FROM ANY JEALOUSY OF MANSFIELD.
SHE WAS AS WELCOME TO WISH HERSELF THERE AS TO BE THERE.

IT WAS SAD TO FANNY TO LOSE ALL THE PLEASURES OF SPRING. SHE HAD NOT
KNOWN BEFORE WHAT PLEASURES SHE HAD TO LOSE IN PASSING MARCH AND APRIL
IN A TOWN. SHE HAD NOT KNOWN BEFORE HOW MUCH THE BEGINNINGS AND PROGRESS
OF VEGETATION HAD DELIGHTED HER. WHAT ANIMATION, BOTH OF BODY AND MIND,
SHE HAD DERIVED FROM WATCHING THE ADVANCE OF THAT SEASON WHICH CANNOT,
IN SPITE OF ITS CAPRICIOUSNESS, BE UNLOVELY, AND SEEING ITS INCREASING
BEAUTIES FROM THE EARLIEST FLOWERS IN THE WARMEST DIVISIONS OF HER
AUNT'S GARDEN, TO THE OPENING OF LEAVES OF HER UNCLE'S PLANTATIONS, AND
THE GLORY OF HIS WOODS. TO BE LOSING SUCH PLEASURES WAS NO TRIFLE; TO
BE LOSING THEM, BECAUSE SHE WAS IN THE MIDST OF CLOSENESS AND NOISE,
TO HAVE CONFINEMENT, BAD AIR, BAD SMELLS, SUBSTITUTED FOR LIBERTY,
FRESHNESS, FRAGRANCE, AND VERDURE, WAS INFINITELY WORSE: BUT EVEN THESE
INCITEMENTS TO REGRET WERE FEEBLE, COMPARED WITH WHAT AROSE FROM THE
CONVICTION OF BEING MISSED BY HER BEST FRIENDS, AND THE LONGING TO BE
USEFUL TO THOSE WHO WERE WANTING HER!

COULD SHE HAVE BEEN AT HOME, SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN OF SERVICE TO EVERY
CREATURE IN THE HOUSE. SHE FELT THAT SHE MUST HAVE BEEN OF USE TO ALL.
TO ALL SHE MUST HAVE SAVED SOME TROUBLE OF HEAD OR HAND; AND WERE IT
ONLY IN SUPPORTING THE SPIRITS OF HER AUNT BERTRAM, KEEPING HER FROM
THE EVIL OF SOLITUDE, OR THE STILL GREATER EVIL OF A RESTLESS, OFFICIOUS
COMPANION, TOO APT TO BE HEIGHTENING DANGER IN ORDER TO ENHANCE HER OWN
IMPORTANCE, HER BEING THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN A GENERAL GOOD. SHE LOVED TO
FANCY HOW SHE COULD HAVE READ TO HER AUNT, HOW SHE COULD HAVE TALKED TO
HER, AND TRIED AT ONCE TO MAKE HER FEEL THE BLESSING OF WHAT WAS, AND
PREPARE HER MIND FOR WHAT MIGHT BE; AND HOW MANY WALKS UP AND DOWN
STAIRS SHE MIGHT HAVE SAVED HER, AND HOW MANY MESSAGES SHE MIGHT HAVE
CARRIED.

IT ASTONISHED HER THAT TOM'S SISTERS COULD BE SATISFIED WITH REMAINING
IN LONDON AT SUCH A TIME, THROUGH AN ILLNESS WHICH HAD NOW, UNDER
DIFFERENT DEGREES OF DANGER, LASTED SEVERAL WEEKS. THEY MIGHT RETURN
TO MANSFIELD WHEN THEY CHOSE; TRAVELLING COULD BE NO DIFFICULTY TO
THEM, AND SHE COULD NOT COMPREHEND HOW BOTH COULD STILL KEEP AWAY.
IF MRS. RUSHWORTH COULD IMAGINE ANY INTERFERING OBLIGATIONS, JULIA WAS
CERTAINLY ABLE TO QUIT LONDON WHENEVER SHE CHOSE. IT APPEARED FROM ONE
OF HER AUNT'S LETTERS THAT JULIA HAD OFFERED TO RETURN IF WANTED, BUT
THIS WAS ALL. IT WAS EVIDENT THAT SHE WOULD RATHER REMAIN WHERE SHE WAS.

FANNY WAS DISPOSED TO THINK THE INFLUENCE OF LONDON VERY MUCH AT WAR
WITH ALL RESPECTABLE ATTACHMENTS. SHE SAW THE PROOF OF IT IN MISS
CRAWFORD, AS WELL AS IN HER COUSINS; HER ATTACHMENT TO EDMUND HAD BEEN
RESPECTABLE, THE MOST RESPECTABLE PART OF HER CHARACTER; HER FRIENDSHIP
FOR HERSELF HAD AT LEAST BEEN BLAMELESS. WHERE WAS EITHER SENTIMENT NOW?
IT WAS SO LONG SINCE FANNY HAD HAD ANY LETTER FROM HER, THAT SHE HAD
SOME REASON TO THINK LIGHTLY OF THE FRIENDSHIP WHICH HAD BEEN SO DWELT
ON. IT WAS WEEKS SINCE SHE HAD HEARD ANYTHING OF MISS CRAWFORD OR OF
HER OTHER CONNEXIONS IN TOWN, EXCEPT THROUGH MANSFIELD, AND SHE WAS
BEGINNING TO SUPPOSE THAT SHE MIGHT NEVER KNOW WHETHER MR. CRAWFORD HAD
GONE INTO NORFOLK AGAIN OR NOT TILL THEY MET, AND MIGHT NEVER HEAR FROM
HIS SISTER ANY MORE THIS SPRING, WHEN THE FOLLOWING LETTER WAS RECEIVED
TO REVIVE OLD AND CREATE SOME NEW SENSATIONS--

"FORGIVE ME, MY DEAR FANNY, AS SOON AS YOU CAN, FOR MY LONG SILENCE, AND
BEHAVE AS IF YOU COULD FORGIVE ME DIRECTLY. THIS IS MY MODEST REQUEST
AND EXPECTATION, FOR YOU ARE SO GOOD, THAT I DEPEND UPON BEING TREATED
BETTER THAN I DESERVE, AND I WRITE NOW TO BEG AN IMMEDIATE ANSWER. I
WANT TO KNOW THE STATE OF THINGS AT MANSFIELD PARK, AND YOU, NO DOUBT,
ARE PERFECTLY ABLE TO GIVE IT. ONE SHOULD BE A BRUTE NOT TO FEEL FOR THE
DISTRESS THEY ARE IN; AND FROM WHAT I HEAR, POOR MR. BERTRAM HAS A BAD
CHANCE OF ULTIMATE RECOVERY. I THOUGHT LITTLE OF HIS ILLNESS AT FIRST.
I LOOKED UPON HIM AS THE SORT OF PERSON TO BE MADE A FUSS WITH, AND TO
MAKE A FUSS HIMSELF IN ANY TRIFLING DISORDER, AND WAS CHIEFLY CONCERNED
FOR THOSE WHO HAD TO NURSE HIM; BUT NOW IT IS CONFIDENTLY ASSERTED THAT
HE IS REALLY IN A DECLINE, THAT THE SYMPTOMS ARE MOST ALARMING, AND THAT
PART OF THE FAMILY, AT LEAST, ARE AWARE OF IT. IF IT BE SO, I AM SURE
YOU MUST BE INCLUDED IN THAT PART, THAT DISCERNING PART, AND THEREFORE
ENTREAT YOU TO LET ME KNOW HOW FAR I HAVE BEEN RIGHTLY INFORMED. I NEED
NOT SAY HOW REJOICED I SHALL BE TO HEAR THERE HAS BEEN ANY MISTAKE, BUT
THE REPORT IS SO PREVALENT THAT I CONFESS I CANNOT HELP TREMBLING. TO
HAVE SUCH A FINE YOUNG MAN CUT OFF IN THE FLOWER OF HIS DAYS IS MOST
MELANCHOLY. POOR SIR THOMAS WILL FEEL IT DREADFULLY. I REALLY AM QUITE
AGITATED ON THE SUBJECT. FANNY, FANNY, I SEE YOU SMILE AND LOOK CUNNING,
BUT, UPON MY HONOUR, I NEVER BRIBED A PHYSICIAN IN MY LIFE. POOR YOUNG
MAN! IF HE IS TO DIE, THERE WILL BE TWO POOR YOUNG MEN LESS IN THE
WORLD; AND WITH A FEARLESS FACE AND BOLD VOICE WOULD I SAY TO ANY ONE,
THAT WEALTH AND CONSEQUENCE COULD FALL INTO NO HANDS MORE DESERVING OF
THEM. IT WAS A FOOLISH PRECIPITATION LAST CHRISTMAS, BUT THE EVIL OF
A FEW DAYS MAY BE BLOTTED OUT IN PART. VARNISH AND GILDING HIDE MANY
STAINS. IT WILL BE BUT THE LOSS OF THE ESQUIRE AFTER HIS NAME. WITH REAL
AFFECTION, FANNY, LIKE MINE, MORE MIGHT BE OVERLOOKED. WRITE TO ME BY
RETURN OF POST, JUDGE OF MY ANXIETY, AND DO NOT TRIFLE WITH IT. TELL ME
THE REAL TRUTH, AS YOU HAVE IT FROM THE FOUNTAINHEAD. AND NOW, DO
NOT TROUBLE YOURSELF TO BE ASHAMED OF EITHER MY FEELINGS OR YOUR OWN.
BELIEVE ME, THEY ARE NOT ONLY NATURAL, THEY ARE PHILANTHROPIC AND
VIRTUOUS. I PUT IT TO YOUR CONSCIENCE, WHETHER 'SIR EDMUND' WOULD NOT DO
MORE GOOD WITH ALL THE BERTRAM PROPERTY THAN ANY OTHER POSSIBLE 'SIR.'
HAD THE GRANTS BEEN AT HOME I WOULD NOT HAVE TROUBLED YOU, BUT YOU ARE
NOW THE ONLY ONE I CAN APPLY TO FOR THE TRUTH, HIS SISTERS NOT BEING
WITHIN MY REACH. MRS. R. HAS BEEN SPENDING THE EASTER WITH THE AYLMERS
AT TWICKENHAM (AS TO BE SURE YOU KNOW), AND IS NOT YET RETURNED; AND
JULIA IS WITH THE COUSINS WHO LIVE NEAR BEDFORD SQUARE, BUT I FORGET
THEIR NAME AND STREET. COULD I IMMEDIATELY APPLY TO EITHER, HOWEVER, I
SHOULD STILL PREFER YOU, BECAUSE IT STRIKES ME THAT THEY HAVE ALL ALONG
BEEN SO UNWILLING TO HAVE THEIR OWN AMUSEMENTS CUT UP, AS TO SHUT THEIR
EYES TO THE TRUTH. I SUPPOSE MRS. R.'S EASTER HOLIDAYS WILL NOT LAST
MUCH LONGER; NO DOUBT THEY ARE THOROUGH HOLIDAYS TO HER. THE AYLMERS
ARE PLEASANT PEOPLE; AND HER HUSBAND AWAY, SHE CAN HAVE NOTHING BUT
ENJOYMENT. I GIVE HER CREDIT FOR PROMOTING HIS GOING DUTIFULLY DOWN TO
BATH, TO FETCH HIS MOTHER; BUT HOW WILL SHE AND THE DOWAGER AGREE IN ONE
HOUSE? HENRY IS NOT AT HAND, SO I HAVE NOTHING TO SAY FROM HIM. DO NOT
YOU THINK EDMUND WOULD HAVE BEEN IN TOWN AGAIN LONG AGO, BUT FOR THIS
ILLNESS?--YOURS EVER, MARY."

"I HAD ACTUALLY BEGUN FOLDING MY LETTER WHEN HENRY WALKED IN, BUT HE
BRINGS NO INTELLIGENCE TO PREVENT MY SENDING IT. MRS. R. KNOWS A DECLINE
IS APPREHENDED; HE SAW HER THIS MORNING: SHE RETURNS TO WIMPOLE STREET
TO-DAY; THE OLD LADY IS COME. NOW DO NOT MAKE YOURSELF UNEASY WITH ANY
QUEER FANCIES BECAUSE HE HAS BEEN SPENDING A FEW DAYS AT RICHMOND. HE
DOES IT EVERY SPRING. BE ASSURED HE CARES FOR NOBODY BUT YOU. AT THIS
VERY MOMENT HE IS WILD TO SEE YOU, AND OCCUPIED ONLY IN CONTRIVING THE
MEANS FOR DOING SO, AND FOR MAKING HIS PLEASURE CONDUCE TO YOURS. IN
PROOF, HE REPEATS, AND MORE EAGERLY, WHAT HE SAID AT PORTSMOUTH ABOUT
OUR CONVEYING YOU HOME, AND I JOIN HIM IN IT WITH ALL MY SOUL. DEAR
FANNY, WRITE DIRECTLY, AND TELL US TO COME. IT WILL DO US ALL GOOD.
HE AND I CAN GO TO THE PARSONAGE, YOU KNOW, AND BE NO TROUBLE TO OUR
FRIENDS AT MANSFIELD PARK. IT WOULD REALLY BE GRATIFYING TO SEE THEM
ALL AGAIN, AND A LITTLE ADDITION OF SOCIETY MIGHT BE OF INFINITE USE TO
THEM; AND AS TO YOURSELF, YOU MUST FEEL YOURSELF TO BE SO WANTED THERE,
THAT YOU CANNOT IN CONSCIENCE--CONSCIENTIOUS AS YOU ARE--KEEP AWAY, WHEN
YOU HAVE THE MEANS OF RETURNING. I HAVE NOT TIME OR PATIENCE TO GIVE
HALF HENRY'S MESSAGES; BE SATISFIED THAT THE SPIRIT OF EACH AND EVERY
ONE IS UNALTERABLE AFFECTION."

FANNY'S DISGUST AT THE GREATER PART OF THIS LETTER, WITH HER EXTREME
RELUCTANCE TO BRING THE WRITER OF IT AND HER COUSIN EDMUND TOGETHER,
WOULD HAVE MADE HER (AS SHE FELT) INCAPABLE OF JUDGING IMPARTIALLY
WHETHER THE CONCLUDING OFFER MIGHT BE ACCEPTED OR NOT. TO HERSELF,
INDIVIDUALLY, IT WAS MOST TEMPTING. TO BE FINDING HERSELF, PERHAPS
WITHIN THREE DAYS, TRANSPORTED TO MANSFIELD, WAS AN IMAGE OF THE
GREATEST FELICITY, BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A MATERIAL DRAWBACK TO BE
OWING SUCH FELICITY TO PERSONS IN WHOSE FEELINGS AND CONDUCT, AT THE
PRESENT MOMENT, SHE SAW SO MUCH TO CONDEMN: THE SISTER'S FEELINGS,
THE BROTHER'S CONDUCT, HER COLD-HEARTED AMBITION, HIS THOUGHTLESS
VANITY. TO HAVE HIM STILL THE ACQUAINTANCE, THE FLIRT PERHAPS, OF MRS.
RUSHWORTH! SHE WAS MORTIFIED. SHE HAD THOUGHT BETTER OF HIM. HAPPILY,
HOWEVER, SHE WAS NOT LEFT TO WEIGH AND DECIDE BETWEEN OPPOSITE
INCLINATIONS AND DOUBTFUL NOTIONS OF RIGHT; THERE WAS NO OCCASION TO
DETERMINE WHETHER SHE OUGHT TO KEEP EDMUND AND MARY ASUNDER OR NOT. SHE
HAD A RULE TO APPLY TO, WHICH SETTLED EVERYTHING. HER AWE OF HER UNCLE,
AND HER DREAD OF TAKING A LIBERTY WITH HIM, MADE IT INSTANTLY PLAIN TO
HER WHAT SHE HAD TO DO. SHE MUST ABSOLUTELY DECLINE THE PROPOSAL. IF HE
WANTED, HE WOULD SEND FOR HER; AND EVEN TO OFFER AN EARLY RETURN WAS
A PRESUMPTION WHICH HARDLY ANYTHING WOULD HAVE SEEMED TO JUSTIFY. SHE
THANKED MISS CRAWFORD, BUT GAVE A DECIDED NEGATIVE. "HER UNCLE,
SHE UNDERSTOOD, MEANT TO FETCH HER; AND AS HER COUSIN'S ILLNESS HAD
CONTINUED SO MANY WEEKS WITHOUT HER BEING THOUGHT AT ALL NECESSARY,
SHE MUST SUPPOSE HER RETURN WOULD BE UNWELCOME AT PRESENT, AND THAT SHE
SHOULD BE FELT AN ENCUMBRANCE."

HER REPRESENTATION OF HER COUSIN'S STATE AT THIS TIME WAS EXACTLY
ACCORDING TO HER OWN BELIEF OF IT, AND SUCH AS SHE SUPPOSED WOULD CONVEY
TO THE SANGUINE MIND OF HER CORRESPONDENT THE HOPE OF EVERYTHING SHE WAS
WISHING FOR. EDMUND WOULD BE FORGIVEN FOR BEING A CLERGYMAN, IT SEEMED,
UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS OF WEALTH; AND THIS, SHE SUSPECTED, WAS ALL
THE CONQUEST OF PREJUDICE WHICH HE WAS SO READY TO CONGRATULATE HIMSELF
UPON. SHE HAD ONLY LEARNT TO THINK NOTHING OF CONSEQUENCE BUT MONEY.



CHAPTER XLVI

AS FANNY COULD NOT DOUBT THAT HER ANSWER WAS CONVEYING A REAL
DISAPPOINTMENT, SHE WAS RATHER IN EXPECTATION, FROM HER KNOWLEDGE OF
MISS CRAWFORD'S TEMPER, OF BEING URGED AGAIN; AND THOUGH NO SECOND
LETTER ARRIVED FOR THE SPACE OF A WEEK, SHE HAD STILL THE SAME FEELING
WHEN IT DID COME.

ON RECEIVING IT, SHE COULD INSTANTLY DECIDE ON ITS CONTAINING LITTLE
WRITING, AND WAS PERSUADED OF ITS HAVING THE AIR OF A LETTER OF HASTE
AND BUSINESS. ITS OBJECT WAS UNQUESTIONABLE; AND TWO MOMENTS WERE ENOUGH
TO START THE PROBABILITY OF ITS BEING MERELY TO GIVE HER NOTICE THAT
THEY SHOULD BE IN PORTSMOUTH THAT VERY DAY, AND TO THROW HER INTO ALL
THE AGITATION OF DOUBTING WHAT SHE OUGHT TO DO IN SUCH A CASE. IF TWO
MOMENTS, HOWEVER, CAN SURROUND WITH DIFFICULTIES, A THIRD CAN DISPERSE
THEM; AND BEFORE SHE HAD OPENED THE LETTER, THE POSSIBILITY OF MR. AND
MISS CRAWFORD'S HAVING APPLIED TO HER UNCLE AND OBTAINED HIS PERMISSION
WAS GIVING HER EASE. THIS WAS THE LETTER--

"A MOST SCANDALOUS, ILL-NATURED RUMOUR HAS JUST REACHED ME, AND I WRITE,
DEAR FANNY, TO WARN YOU AGAINST GIVING THE LEAST CREDIT TO IT, SHOULD IT
SPREAD INTO THE COUNTRY. DEPEND UPON IT, THERE IS SOME MISTAKE, AND THAT
A DAY OR TWO WILL CLEAR IT UP; AT ANY RATE, THAT HENRY IS BLAMELESS, AND
IN SPITE OF A MOMENT'S ETOURDERIE, THINKS OF NOBODY BUT YOU. SAY NOT A
WORD OF IT; HEAR NOTHING, SURMISE NOTHING, WHISPER NOTHING TILL I
WRITE AGAIN. I AM SURE IT WILL BE ALL HUSHED UP, AND NOTHING PROVED BUT
RUSHWORTH'S FOLLY. IF THEY ARE GONE, I WOULD LAY MY LIFE THEY ARE ONLY
GONE TO MANSFIELD PARK, AND JULIA WITH THEM. BUT WHY WOULD NOT YOU LET
US COME FOR YOU? I WISH YOU MAY NOT REPENT IT.--YOURS, ETC."

FANNY STOOD AGHAST. AS NO SCANDALOUS, ILL-NATURED RUMOUR HAD REACHED
HER, IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HER TO UNDERSTAND MUCH OF THIS STRANGE
LETTER. SHE COULD ONLY PERCEIVE THAT IT MUST RELATE TO WIMPOLE STREET
AND MR. CRAWFORD, AND ONLY CONJECTURE THAT SOMETHING VERY IMPRUDENT HAD
JUST OCCURRED IN THAT QUARTER TO DRAW THE NOTICE OF THE WORLD, AND TO
EXCITE HER JEALOUSY, IN MISS CRAWFORD'S APPREHENSION, IF SHE HEARD IT.
MISS CRAWFORD NEED NOT BE ALARMED FOR HER. SHE WAS ONLY SORRY FOR THE
PARTIES CONCERNED AND FOR MANSFIELD, IF THE REPORT SHOULD SPREAD SO FAR;
BUT SHE HOPED IT MIGHT NOT. IF THE RUSHWORTHS WERE GONE THEMSELVES TO
MANSFIELD, AS WAS TO BE INFERRED FROM WHAT MISS CRAWFORD SAID, IT WAS
NOT LIKELY THAT ANYTHING UNPLEASANT SHOULD HAVE PRECEDED THEM, OR AT
LEAST SHOULD MAKE ANY IMPRESSION.

AS TO MR. CRAWFORD, SHE HOPED IT MIGHT GIVE HIM A KNOWLEDGE OF HIS OWN
DISPOSITION, CONVINCE HIM THAT HE WAS NOT CAPABLE OF BEING STEADILY
ATTACHED TO ANY ONE WOMAN IN THE WORLD, AND SHAME HIM FROM PERSISTING
ANY LONGER IN ADDRESSING HERSELF.

IT WAS VERY STRANGE! SHE HAD BEGUN TO THINK HE REALLY LOVED HER, AND TO
FANCY HIS AFFECTION FOR HER SOMETHING MORE THAN COMMON; AND HIS SISTER
STILL SAID THAT HE CARED FOR NOBODY ELSE. YET THERE MUST HAVE BEEN SOME
MARKED DISPLAY OF ATTENTIONS TO HER COUSIN, THERE MUST HAVE BEEN SOME
STRONG INDISCRETION, SINCE HER CORRESPONDENT WAS NOT OF A SORT TO REGARD
A SLIGHT ONE.

VERY UNCOMFORTABLE SHE WAS, AND MUST CONTINUE, TILL SHE HEARD FROM
MISS CRAWFORD AGAIN. IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO BANISH THE LETTER FROM HER
THOUGHTS, AND SHE COULD NOT RELIEVE HERSELF BY SPEAKING OF IT TO ANY
HUMAN BEING. MISS CRAWFORD NEED NOT HAVE URGED SECRECY WITH SO MUCH
WARMTH; SHE MIGHT HAVE TRUSTED TO HER SENSE OF WHAT WAS DUE TO HER
COUSIN.

THE NEXT DAY CAME AND BROUGHT NO SECOND LETTER. FANNY WAS DISAPPOINTED.
SHE COULD STILL THINK OF LITTLE ELSE ALL THE MORNING; BUT, WHEN HER
FATHER CAME BACK IN THE AFTERNOON WITH THE DAILY NEWSPAPER AS USUAL, SHE
WAS SO FAR FROM EXPECTING ANY ELUCIDATION THROUGH SUCH A CHANNEL THAT
THE SUBJECT WAS FOR A MOMENT OUT OF HER HEAD.

SHE WAS DEEP IN OTHER MUSING. THE REMEMBRANCE OF HER FIRST EVENING IN
THAT ROOM, OF HER FATHER AND HIS NEWSPAPER, CAME ACROSS HER. NO CANDLE
WAS NOW WANTED. THE SUN WAS YET AN HOUR AND HALF ABOVE THE HORIZON. SHE
FELT THAT SHE HAD, INDEED, BEEN THREE MONTHS THERE; AND THE SUN'S RAYS
FALLING STRONGLY INTO THE PARLOUR, INSTEAD OF CHEERING, MADE HER STILL
MORE MELANCHOLY, FOR SUNSHINE APPEARED TO HER A TOTALLY DIFFERENT
THING IN A TOWN AND IN THE COUNTRY. HERE, ITS POWER WAS ONLY A GLARE:
A STIFLING, SICKLY GLARE, SERVING BUT TO BRING FORWARD STAINS AND DIRT
THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE SLEPT. THERE WAS NEITHER HEALTH NOR GAIETY IN
SUNSHINE IN A TOWN. SHE SAT IN A BLAZE OF OPPRESSIVE HEAT, IN A CLOUD
OF MOVING DUST, AND HER EYES COULD ONLY WANDER FROM THE WALLS, MARKED BY
HER FATHER'S HEAD, TO THE TABLE CUT AND NOTCHED BY HER BROTHERS, WHERE
STOOD THE TEA-BOARD NEVER THOROUGHLY CLEANED, THE CUPS AND SAUCERS WIPED
IN STREAKS, THE MILK A MIXTURE OF MOTES FLOATING IN THIN BLUE, AND THE
BREAD AND BUTTER GROWING EVERY MINUTE MORE GREASY THAN EVEN REBECCA'S
HANDS HAD FIRST PRODUCED IT. HER FATHER READ HIS NEWSPAPER, AND HER
MOTHER LAMENTED OVER THE RAGGED CARPET AS USUAL, WHILE THE TEA WAS
IN PREPARATION, AND WISHED REBECCA WOULD MEND IT; AND FANNY WAS FIRST
ROUSED BY HIS CALLING OUT TO HER, AFTER HUMPHING AND CONSIDERING OVER
A PARTICULAR PARAGRAPH: "WHAT'S THE NAME OF YOUR GREAT COUSINS IN TOWN,
FAN?"

A MOMENT'S RECOLLECTION ENABLED HER TO SAY, "RUSHWORTH, SIR."

"AND DON'T THEY LIVE IN WIMPOLE STREET?"

"YES, SIR."

"THEN, THERE'S THE DEVIL TO PAY AMONG THEM, THAT'S ALL! THERE" (HOLDING
OUT THE PAPER TO HER); "MUCH GOOD MAY SUCH FINE RELATIONS DO YOU. I
DON'T KNOW WHAT SIR THOMAS MAY THINK OF SUCH MATTERS; HE MAY BE TOO MUCH
OF THE COURTIER AND FINE GENTLEMAN TO LIKE HIS DAUGHTER THE LESS. BUT,
BY G--! IF SHE BELONGED TO ME, I'D GIVE HER THE ROPE'S END AS LONG AS
I COULD STAND OVER HER. A LITTLE FLOGGING FOR MAN AND WOMAN TOO WOULD BE
THE BEST WAY OF PREVENTING SUCH THINGS."

FANNY READ TO HERSELF THAT "IT WAS WITH INFINITE CONCERN THE NEWSPAPER
HAD TO ANNOUNCE TO THE WORLD A MATRIMONIAL FRACAS IN THE FAMILY OF
MR. R. OF WIMPOLE STREET; THE BEAUTIFUL MRS. R., WHOSE NAME HAD NOT LONG
BEEN ENROLLED IN THE LISTS OF HYMEN, AND WHO HAD PROMISED TO BECOME
SO BRILLIANT A LEADER IN THE FASHIONABLE WORLD, HAVING QUITTED HER
HUSBAND'S ROOF IN COMPANY WITH THE WELL-KNOWN AND CAPTIVATING MR. C.,
THE INTIMATE FRIEND AND ASSOCIATE OF MR. R., AND IT WAS NOT KNOWN EVEN
TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEWSPAPER WHITHER THEY WERE GONE."

"IT IS A MISTAKE, SIR," SAID FANNY INSTANTLY; "IT MUST BE A MISTAKE, IT
CANNOT BE TRUE; IT MUST MEAN SOME OTHER PEOPLE."

SHE SPOKE FROM THE INSTINCTIVE WISH OF DELAYING SHAME; SHE SPOKE WITH
A RESOLUTION WHICH SPRUNG FROM DESPAIR, FOR SHE SPOKE WHAT SHE DID NOT,
COULD NOT BELIEVE HERSELF. IT HAD BEEN THE SHOCK OF CONVICTION AS SHE
READ. THE TRUTH RUSHED ON HER; AND HOW SHE COULD HAVE SPOKEN AT ALL,
HOW SHE COULD EVEN HAVE BREATHED, WAS AFTERWARDS MATTER OF WONDER TO
HERSELF.

MR. PRICE CARED TOO LITTLE ABOUT THE REPORT TO MAKE HER MUCH ANSWER.
"IT MIGHT BE ALL A LIE," HE ACKNOWLEDGED; "BUT SO MANY FINE LADIES WERE
GOING TO THE DEVIL NOWADAYS THAT WAY, THAT THERE WAS NO ANSWERING FOR
ANYBODY."

"INDEED, I HOPE IT IS NOT TRUE," SAID MRS. PRICE PLAINTIVELY; "IT WOULD
BE SO VERY SHOCKING! IF I HAVE SPOKEN ONCE TO REBECCA ABOUT THAT CARPET,
I AM SURE I HAVE SPOKE AT LEAST A DOZEN TIMES; HAVE NOT I, BETSEY? AND
IT WOULD NOT BE TEN MINUTES' WORK."

THE HORROR OF A MIND LIKE FANNY'S, AS IT RECEIVED THE CONVICTION OF SUCH
GUILT, AND BEGAN TO TAKE IN SOME PART OF THE MISERY THAT MUST ENSUE, CAN
HARDLY BE DESCRIBED. AT FIRST, IT WAS A SORT OF STUPEFACTION; BUT EVERY
MOMENT WAS QUICKENING HER PERCEPTION OF THE HORRIBLE EVIL. SHE COULD NOT
DOUBT, SHE DARED NOT INDULGE A HOPE, OF THE PARAGRAPH BEING FALSE. MISS
CRAWFORD'S LETTER, WHICH SHE HAD READ SO OFTEN AS TO MAKE EVERY LINE
HER OWN, WAS IN FRIGHTFUL CONFORMITY WITH IT. HER EAGER DEFENCE OF HER
BROTHER, HER HOPE OF ITS BEING HUSHED UP, HER EVIDENT AGITATION,
WERE ALL OF A PIECE WITH SOMETHING VERY BAD; AND IF THERE WAS A WOMAN
OF CHARACTER IN EXISTENCE, WHO COULD TREAT AS A TRIFLE THIS SIN OF THE
FIRST MAGNITUDE, WHO WOULD TRY TO GLOSS IT OVER, AND DESIRE TO HAVE IT
UNPUNISHED, SHE COULD BELIEVE MISS CRAWFORD TO BE THE WOMAN! NOW SHE
COULD SEE HER OWN MISTAKE AS TO WHO WERE GONE, OR SAID TO BE
GONE. IT WAS NOT MR. AND MRS. RUSHWORTH; IT WAS MRS. RUSHWORTH AND MR.
CRAWFORD.

FANNY SEEMED TO HERSELF NEVER TO HAVE BEEN SHOCKED BEFORE. THERE WAS NO
POSSIBILITY OF REST. THE EVENING PASSED WITHOUT A PAUSE OF MISERY, THE
NIGHT WAS TOTALLY SLEEPLESS. SHE PASSED ONLY FROM FEELINGS OF SICKNESS
TO SHUDDERINGS OF HORROR; AND FROM HOT FITS OF FEVER TO COLD. THE EVENT
WAS SO SHOCKING, THAT THERE WERE MOMENTS EVEN WHEN HER HEART REVOLTED
FROM IT AS IMPOSSIBLE: WHEN SHE THOUGHT IT COULD NOT BE. A WOMAN MARRIED
ONLY SIX MONTHS AGO; A MAN PROFESSING HIMSELF DEVOTED, EVEN ENGAGED TO
ANOTHER; THAT OTHER HER NEAR RELATION; THE WHOLE FAMILY, BOTH FAMILIES
CONNECTED AS THEY WERE BY TIE UPON TIE; ALL FRIENDS, ALL INTIMATE
TOGETHER! IT WAS TOO HORRIBLE A CONFUSION OF GUILT, TOO GROSS A
COMPLICATION OF EVIL, FOR HUMAN NATURE, NOT IN A STATE OF UTTER
BARBARISM, TO BE CAPABLE OF! YET HER JUDGMENT TOLD HER IT WAS SO.
HIS UNSETTLED AFFECTIONS, WAVERING WITH HIS VANITY, MARIA'S
DECIDED ATTACHMENT, AND NO SUFFICIENT PRINCIPLE ON EITHER SIDE, GAVE IT
POSSIBILITY: MISS CRAWFORD'S LETTER STAMPT IT A FACT.

WHAT WOULD BE THE CONSEQUENCE? WHOM WOULD IT NOT INJURE? WHOSE VIEWS
MIGHT IT NOT AFFECT? WHOSE PEACE WOULD IT NOT CUT UP FOR EVER? MISS
CRAWFORD, HERSELF, EDMUND; BUT IT WAS DANGEROUS, PERHAPS, TO TREAD
SUCH GROUND. SHE CONFINED HERSELF, OR TRIED TO CONFINE HERSELF, TO THE
SIMPLE, INDUBITABLE FAMILY MISERY WHICH MUST ENVELOP ALL, IF IT WERE
INDEED A MATTER OF CERTIFIED GUILT AND PUBLIC EXPOSURE. THE MOTHER'S
SUFFERINGS, THE FATHER'S; THERE SHE PAUSED. JULIA'S, TOM'S, EDMUND'S;
THERE A YET LONGER PAUSE. THEY WERE THE TWO ON WHOM IT WOULD FALL MOST
HORRIBLY. SIR THOMAS'S PARENTAL SOLICITUDE AND HIGH SENSE OF HONOUR AND
DECORUM, EDMUND'S UPRIGHT PRINCIPLES, UNSUSPICIOUS TEMPER, AND GENUINE
STRENGTH OF FEELING, MADE HER THINK IT SCARCELY POSSIBLE FOR THEM TO
SUPPORT LIFE AND REASON UNDER SUCH DISGRACE; AND IT APPEARED TO HER
THAT, AS FAR AS THIS WORLD ALONE WAS CONCERNED, THE GREATEST BLESSING TO
EVERY ONE OF KINDRED WITH MRS. RUSHWORTH WOULD BE INSTANT ANNIHILATION.

NOTHING HAPPENED THE NEXT DAY, OR THE NEXT, TO WEAKEN HER TERRORS. TWO
POSTS CAME IN, AND BROUGHT NO REFUTATION, PUBLIC OR PRIVATE. THERE WAS
NO SECOND LETTER TO EXPLAIN AWAY THE FIRST FROM MISS CRAWFORD; THERE WAS
NO INTELLIGENCE FROM MANSFIELD, THOUGH IT WAS NOW FULL TIME FOR HER
TO HEAR AGAIN FROM HER AUNT. THIS WAS AN EVIL OMEN. SHE HAD, INDEED,
SCARCELY THE SHADOW OF A HOPE TO SOOTHE HER MIND, AND WAS REDUCED TO SO
LOW AND WAN AND TREMBLING A CONDITION, AS NO MOTHER, NOT UNKIND, EXCEPT
MRS. PRICE COULD HAVE OVERLOOKED, WHEN THE THIRD DAY DID BRING THE
SICKENING KNOCK, AND A LETTER WAS AGAIN PUT INTO HER HANDS. IT BORE THE
LONDON POSTMARK, AND CAME FROM EDMUND.

"DEAR FANNY,--YOU KNOW OUR PRESENT WRETCHEDNESS. MAY GOD SUPPORT YOU
UNDER YOUR SHARE! WE HAVE BEEN HERE TWO DAYS, BUT THERE IS NOTHING TO
BE DONE. THEY CANNOT BE TRACED. YOU MAY NOT HAVE HEARD OF THE LAST
BLOW--JULIA'S ELOPEMENT; SHE IS GONE TO SCOTLAND WITH YATES. SHE LEFT
LONDON A FEW HOURS BEFORE WE ENTERED IT. AT ANY OTHER TIME THIS WOULD
HAVE BEEN FELT DREADFULLY. NOW IT SEEMS NOTHING; YET IT IS AN HEAVY
AGGRAVATION. MY FATHER IS NOT OVERPOWERED. MORE CANNOT BE HOPED. HE IS
STILL ABLE TO THINK AND ACT; AND I WRITE, BY HIS DESIRE, TO PROPOSE YOUR
RETURNING HOME. HE IS ANXIOUS TO GET YOU THERE FOR MY MOTHER'S SAKE. I
SHALL BE AT PORTSMOUTH THE MORNING AFTER YOU RECEIVE THIS, AND HOPE TO
FIND YOU READY TO SET OFF FOR MANSFIELD. MY FATHER WISHES YOU TO INVITE
SUSAN TO GO WITH YOU FOR A FEW MONTHS. SETTLE IT AS YOU LIKE; SAY WHAT
IS PROPER; I AM SURE YOU WILL FEEL SUCH AN INSTANCE OF HIS KINDNESS AT
SUCH A MOMENT! DO JUSTICE TO HIS MEANING, HOWEVER I MAY CONFUSE IT. YOU
MAY IMAGINE SOMETHING OF MY PRESENT STATE. THERE IS NO END OF THE EVIL
LET LOOSE UPON US. YOU WILL SEE ME EARLY BY THE MAIL.--YOURS, ETC."

NEVER HAD FANNY MORE WANTED A CORDIAL. NEVER HAD SHE FELT SUCH A ONE
AS THIS LETTER CONTAINED. TO-MORROW! TO LEAVE PORTSMOUTH TO-MORROW!
SHE WAS, SHE FELT SHE WAS, IN THE GREATEST DANGER OF BEING EXQUISITELY
HAPPY, WHILE SO MANY WERE MISERABLE. THE EVIL WHICH BROUGHT SUCH GOOD
TO HER! SHE DREADED LEST SHE SHOULD LEARN TO BE INSENSIBLE OF IT. TO BE
GOING SO SOON, SENT FOR SO KINDLY, SENT FOR AS A COMFORT, AND WITH LEAVE
TO TAKE SUSAN, WAS ALTOGETHER SUCH A COMBINATION OF BLESSINGS AS SET HER
HEART IN A GLOW, AND FOR A TIME SEEMED TO DISTANCE EVERY PAIN, AND
MAKE HER INCAPABLE OF SUITABLY SHARING THE DISTRESS EVEN OF THOSE
WHOSE DISTRESS SHE THOUGHT OF MOST. JULIA'S ELOPEMENT COULD AFFECT HER
COMPARATIVELY BUT LITTLE; SHE WAS AMAZED AND SHOCKED; BUT IT COULD NOT
OCCUPY HER, COULD NOT DWELL ON HER MIND. SHE WAS OBLIGED TO CALL HERSELF
TO THINK OF IT, AND ACKNOWLEDGE IT TO BE TERRIBLE AND GRIEVOUS, OR IT
WAS ESCAPING HER, IN THE MIDST OF ALL THE AGITATING PRESSING JOYFUL
CARES ATTENDING THIS SUMMONS TO HERSELF.

THERE IS NOTHING LIKE EMPLOYMENT, ACTIVE INDISPENSABLE EMPLOYMENT, FOR
RELIEVING SORROW. EMPLOYMENT, EVEN MELANCHOLY, MAY DISPEL MELANCHOLY,
AND HER OCCUPATIONS WERE HOPEFUL. SHE HAD SO MUCH TO DO, THAT NOT EVEN
THE HORRIBLE STORY OF MRS. RUSHWORTH--NOW FIXED TO THE LAST POINT OF
CERTAINTY COULD AFFECT HER AS IT HAD DONE BEFORE. SHE HAD NOT TIME TO
BE MISERABLE. WITHIN TWENTY-FOUR HOURS SHE WAS HOPING TO BE GONE; HER
FATHER AND MOTHER MUST BE SPOKEN TO, SUSAN PREPARED, EVERYTHING GOT
READY. BUSINESS FOLLOWED BUSINESS; THE DAY WAS HARDLY LONG ENOUGH. THE
HAPPINESS SHE WAS IMPARTING, TOO, HAPPINESS VERY LITTLE ALLOYED BY THE
BLACK COMMUNICATION WHICH MUST BRIEFLY PRECEDE IT--THE JOYFUL CONSENT
OF HER FATHER AND MOTHER TO SUSAN'S GOING WITH HER--THE GENERAL
SATISFACTION WITH WHICH THE GOING OF BOTH SEEMED REGARDED, AND THE
ECSTASY OF SUSAN HERSELF, WAS ALL SERVING TO SUPPORT HER SPIRITS.

THE AFFLICTION OF THE BERTRAMS WAS LITTLE FELT IN THE FAMILY. MRS. PRICE
TALKED OF HER POOR SISTER FOR A FEW MINUTES, BUT HOW TO FIND ANYTHING TO
HOLD SUSAN'S CLOTHES, BECAUSE REBECCA TOOK AWAY ALL THE BOXES AND SPOILT
THEM, WAS MUCH MORE IN HER THOUGHTS: AND AS FOR SUSAN, NOW UNEXPECTEDLY
GRATIFIED IN THE FIRST WISH OF HER HEART, AND KNOWING NOTHING PERSONALLY
OF THOSE WHO HAD SINNED, OR OF THOSE WHO WERE SORROWING--IF SHE COULD
HELP REJOICING FROM BEGINNING TO END, IT WAS AS MUCH AS OUGHT TO BE
EXPECTED FROM HUMAN VIRTUE AT FOURTEEN.

AS NOTHING WAS REALLY LEFT FOR THE DECISION OF MRS. PRICE, OR THE GOOD
OFFICES OF REBECCA, EVERYTHING WAS RATIONALLY AND DULY ACCOMPLISHED,
AND THE GIRLS WERE READY FOR THE MORROW. THE ADVANTAGE OF MUCH SLEEP
TO PREPARE THEM FOR THEIR JOURNEY WAS IMPOSSIBLE. THE COUSIN WHO WAS
TRAVELLING TOWARDS THEM COULD HARDLY HAVE LESS THAN VISITED THEIR
AGITATED SPIRITS--ONE ALL HAPPINESS, THE OTHER ALL VARYING AND
INDESCRIBABLE PERTURBATION.

BY EIGHT IN THE MORNING EDMUND WAS IN THE HOUSE. THE GIRLS HEARD HIS
ENTRANCE FROM ABOVE, AND FANNY WENT DOWN. THE IDEA OF IMMEDIATELY SEEING
HIM, WITH THE KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT HE MUST BE SUFFERING, BROUGHT BACK ALL
HER OWN FIRST FEELINGS. HE SO NEAR HER, AND IN MISERY. SHE WAS READY TO
SINK AS SHE ENTERED THE PARLOUR. HE WAS ALONE, AND MET HER INSTANTLY;
AND SHE FOUND HERSELF PRESSED TO HIS HEART WITH ONLY THESE WORDS, JUST
ARTICULATE, "MY FANNY, MY ONLY SISTER; MY ONLY COMFORT NOW!" SHE COULD
SAY NOTHING; NOR FOR SOME MINUTES COULD HE SAY MORE.

HE TURNED AWAY TO RECOVER HIMSELF, AND WHEN HE SPOKE AGAIN, THOUGH HIS
VOICE STILL FALTERED, HIS MANNER SHEWED THE WISH OF SELF-COMMAND, AND
THE RESOLUTION OF AVOIDING ANY FARTHER ALLUSION. "HAVE YOU BREAKFASTED?
WHEN SHALL YOU BE READY? DOES SUSAN GO?" WERE QUESTIONS FOLLOWING EACH
OTHER RAPIDLY. HIS GREAT OBJECT WAS TO BE OFF AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. WHEN
MANSFIELD WAS CONSIDERED, TIME WAS PRECIOUS; AND THE STATE OF HIS OWN
MIND MADE HIM FIND RELIEF ONLY IN MOTION. IT WAS SETTLED THAT HE SHOULD
ORDER THE CARRIAGE TO THE DOOR IN HALF AN HOUR. FANNY ANSWERED FOR THEIR
HAVING BREAKFASTED AND BEING QUITE READY IN HALF AN HOUR. HE HAD ALREADY
ATE, AND DECLINED STAYING FOR THEIR MEAL. HE WOULD WALK ROUND THE
RAMPARTS, AND JOIN THEM WITH THE CARRIAGE. HE WAS GONE AGAIN; GLAD TO
GET AWAY EVEN FROM FANNY.

HE LOOKED VERY ILL; EVIDENTLY SUFFERING UNDER VIOLENT EMOTIONS, WHICH HE
WAS DETERMINED TO SUPPRESS. SHE KNEW IT MUST BE SO, BUT IT WAS TERRIBLE
TO HER.

THE CARRIAGE CAME; AND HE ENTERED THE HOUSE AGAIN AT THE SAME
MOMENT, JUST IN TIME TO SPEND A FEW MINUTES WITH THE FAMILY, AND BE A
WITNESS--BUT THAT HE SAW NOTHING--OF THE TRANQUIL MANNER IN WHICH THE
DAUGHTERS WERE PARTED WITH, AND JUST IN TIME TO PREVENT THEIR SITTING
DOWN TO THE BREAKFAST-TABLE, WHICH, BY DINT OF MUCH UNUSUAL ACTIVITY,
WAS QUITE AND COMPLETELY READY AS THE CARRIAGE DROVE FROM THE DOOR.
FANNY'S LAST MEAL IN HER FATHER'S HOUSE WAS IN CHARACTER WITH HER FIRST:
SHE WAS DISMISSED FROM IT AS HOSPITABLY AS SHE HAD BEEN WELCOMED.

HOW HER HEART SWELLED WITH JOY AND GRATITUDE AS SHE PASSED THE BARRIERS
OF PORTSMOUTH, AND HOW SUSAN'S FACE WORE ITS BROADEST SMILES, MAY BE
EASILY CONCEIVED. SITTING FORWARDS, HOWEVER, AND SCREENED BY HER BONNET,
THOSE SMILES WERE UNSEEN.

THE JOURNEY WAS LIKELY TO BE A SILENT ONE. EDMUND'S DEEP SIGHS OFTEN
REACHED FANNY. HAD HE BEEN ALONE WITH HER, HIS HEART MUST HAVE OPENED
IN SPITE OF EVERY RESOLUTION; BUT SUSAN'S PRESENCE DROVE HIM QUITE INTO
HIMSELF, AND HIS ATTEMPTS TO TALK ON INDIFFERENT SUBJECTS COULD NEVER BE
LONG SUPPORTED.

FANNY WATCHED HIM WITH NEVER-FAILING SOLICITUDE, AND SOMETIMES CATCHING
HIS EYE, REVIVED AN AFFECTIONATE SMILE, WHICH COMFORTED HER; BUT THE
FIRST DAY'S JOURNEY PASSED WITHOUT HER HEARING A WORD FROM HIM ON THE
SUBJECTS THAT WERE WEIGHING HIM DOWN. THE NEXT MORNING PRODUCED A
LITTLE MORE. JUST BEFORE THEIR SETTING OUT FROM OXFORD, WHILE SUSAN WAS
STATIONED AT A WINDOW, IN EAGER OBSERVATION OF THE DEPARTURE OF A
LARGE FAMILY FROM THE INN, THE OTHER TWO WERE STANDING BY THE FIRE; AND
EDMUND, PARTICULARLY STRUCK BY THE ALTERATION IN FANNY'S LOOKS, AND FROM
HIS IGNORANCE OF THE DAILY EVILS OF HER FATHER'S HOUSE, ATTRIBUTING AN
UNDUE SHARE OF THE CHANGE, ATTRIBUTING ALL TO THE RECENT EVENT, TOOK
HER HAND, AND SAID IN A LOW, BUT VERY EXPRESSIVE TONE, "NO WONDER--YOU
MUST FEEL IT--YOU MUST SUFFER. HOW A MAN WHO HAD ONCE LOVED, COULD
DESERT YOU! BUT YOURS--YOUR REGARD WAS NEW COMPARED WITH----FANNY,
THINK OF ME!"

THE FIRST DIVISION OF THEIR JOURNEY OCCUPIED A LONG DAY, AND BROUGHT
THEM, ALMOST KNOCKED UP, TO OXFORD; BUT THE SECOND WAS OVER AT A MUCH
EARLIER HOUR. THEY WERE IN THE ENVIRONS OF MANSFIELD LONG BEFORE THE
USUAL DINNER-TIME, AND AS THEY APPROACHED THE BELOVED PLACE, THE HEARTS
OF BOTH SISTERS SANK A LITTLE. FANNY BEGAN TO DREAD THE MEETING WITH HER
AUNTS AND TOM, UNDER SO DREADFUL A HUMILIATION; AND SUSAN TO FEEL
WITH SOME ANXIETY, THAT ALL HER BEST MANNERS, ALL HER LATELY ACQUIRED
KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT WAS PRACTISED HERE, WAS ON THE POINT OF BEING CALLED
INTO ACTION. VISIONS OF GOOD AND ILL BREEDING, OF OLD VULGARISMS AND NEW
GENTILITIES, WERE BEFORE HER; AND SHE WAS MEDITATING MUCH UPON SILVER
FORKS, NAPKINS, AND FINGER-GLASSES. FANNY HAD BEEN EVERYWHERE AWAKE TO
THE DIFFERENCE OF THE COUNTRY SINCE FEBRUARY; BUT WHEN THEY ENTERED THE
PARK HER PERCEPTIONS AND HER PLEASURES WERE OF THE KEENEST SORT. IT WAS
THREE MONTHS, FULL THREE MONTHS, SINCE HER QUITTING IT, AND THE
CHANGE WAS FROM WINTER TO SUMMER. HER EYE FELL EVERYWHERE ON LAWNS
AND PLANTATIONS OF THE FRESHEST GREEN; AND THE TREES, THOUGH NOT FULLY
CLOTHED, WERE IN THAT DELIGHTFUL STATE WHEN FARTHER BEAUTY IS KNOWN TO
BE AT HAND, AND WHEN, WHILE MUCH IS ACTUALLY GIVEN TO THE SIGHT, MORE
YET REMAINS FOR THE IMAGINATION. HER ENJOYMENT, HOWEVER, WAS FOR HERSELF
ALONE. EDMUND COULD NOT SHARE IT. SHE LOOKED AT HIM, BUT HE WAS LEANING
BACK, SUNK IN A DEEPER GLOOM THAN EVER, AND WITH EYES CLOSED, AS IF THE
VIEW OF CHEERFULNESS OPPRESSED HIM, AND THE LOVELY SCENES OF HOME MUST
BE SHUT OUT.

IT MADE HER MELANCHOLY AGAIN; AND THE KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT MUST BE ENDURING
THERE, INVESTED EVEN THE HOUSE, MODERN, AIRY, AND WELL SITUATED AS IT
WAS, WITH A MELANCHOLY ASPECT.

BY ONE OF THE SUFFERING PARTY WITHIN THEY WERE EXPECTED WITH SUCH
IMPATIENCE AS SHE HAD NEVER KNOWN BEFORE. FANNY HAD SCARCELY PASSED THE
SOLEMN-LOOKING SERVANTS, WHEN LADY BERTRAM CAME FROM THE DRAWING-ROOM
TO MEET HER; CAME WITH NO INDOLENT STEP; AND FALLING ON HER NECK, SAID,
"DEAR FANNY! NOW I SHALL BE COMFORTABLE."



CHAPTER XLVII

IT HAD BEEN A MISERABLE PARTY, EACH OF THE THREE BELIEVING THEMSELVES
MOST MISERABLE. MRS. NORRIS, HOWEVER, AS MOST ATTACHED TO MARIA, WAS
REALLY THE GREATEST SUFFERER. MARIA WAS HER FIRST FAVOURITE, THE DEAREST
OF ALL; THE MATCH HAD BEEN HER OWN CONTRIVING, AS SHE HAD BEEN WONT WITH
SUCH PRIDE OF HEART TO FEEL AND SAY, AND THIS CONCLUSION OF IT ALMOST
OVERPOWERED HER.

SHE WAS AN ALTERED CREATURE, QUIETED, STUPEFIED, INDIFFERENT TO
EVERYTHING THAT PASSED. THE BEING LEFT WITH HER SISTER AND NEPHEW, AND
ALL THE HOUSE UNDER HER CARE, HAD BEEN AN ADVANTAGE ENTIRELY THROWN
AWAY; SHE HAD BEEN UNABLE TO DIRECT OR DICTATE, OR EVEN FANCY HERSELF
USEFUL. WHEN REALLY TOUCHED BY AFFLICTION, HER ACTIVE POWERS HAD BEEN
ALL BENUMBED; AND NEITHER LADY BERTRAM NOR TOM HAD RECEIVED FROM HER THE
SMALLEST SUPPORT OR ATTEMPT AT SUPPORT. SHE HAD DONE NO MORE FOR THEM
THAN THEY HAD DONE FOR EACH OTHER. THEY HAD BEEN ALL SOLITARY, HELPLESS,
AND FORLORN ALIKE; AND NOW THE ARRIVAL OF THE OTHERS ONLY ESTABLISHED
HER SUPERIORITY IN WRETCHEDNESS. HER COMPANIONS WERE RELIEVED, BUT THERE
WAS NO GOOD FOR HER. EDMUND WAS ALMOST AS WELCOME TO HIS BROTHER
AS FANNY TO HER AUNT; BUT MRS. NORRIS, INSTEAD OF HAVING COMFORT FROM
EITHER, WAS BUT THE MORE IRRITATED BY THE SIGHT OF THE PERSON WHOM, IN
THE BLINDNESS OF HER ANGER, SHE COULD HAVE CHARGED AS THE DAEMON OF THE
PIECE. HAD FANNY ACCEPTED MR. CRAWFORD THIS COULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED.

SUSAN TOO WAS A GRIEVANCE. SHE HAD NOT SPIRITS TO NOTICE HER IN MORE
THAN A FEW REPULSIVE LOOKS, BUT SHE FELT HER AS A SPY, AND AN INTRUDER,
AND AN INDIGENT NIECE, AND EVERYTHING MOST ODIOUS. BY HER OTHER AUNT,
SUSAN WAS RECEIVED WITH QUIET KINDNESS. LADY BERTRAM COULD NOT GIVE HER
MUCH TIME, OR MANY WORDS, BUT SHE FELT HER, AS FANNY'S SISTER, TO HAVE
A CLAIM AT MANSFIELD, AND WAS READY TO KISS AND LIKE HER; AND SUSAN
WAS MORE THAN SATISFIED, FOR SHE CAME PERFECTLY AWARE THAT NOTHING BUT
ILL-HUMOUR WAS TO BE EXPECTED FROM AUNT NORRIS; AND WAS SO PROVIDED
WITH HAPPINESS, SO STRONG IN THAT BEST OF BLESSINGS, AN ESCAPE FROM
MANY CERTAIN EVILS, THAT SHE COULD HAVE STOOD AGAINST A GREAT DEAL MORE
INDIFFERENCE THAN SHE MET WITH FROM THE OTHERS.

SHE WAS NOW LEFT A GOOD DEAL TO HERSELF, TO GET ACQUAINTED WITH THE
HOUSE AND GROUNDS AS SHE COULD, AND SPENT HER DAYS VERY HAPPILY IN SO
DOING, WHILE THOSE WHO MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE ATTENDED TO HER WERE SHUT
UP, OR WHOLLY OCCUPIED EACH WITH THE PERSON QUITE DEPENDENT ON THEM, AT
THIS TIME, FOR EVERYTHING LIKE COMFORT; EDMUND TRYING TO BURY HIS OWN
FEELINGS IN EXERTIONS FOR THE RELIEF OF HIS BROTHER'S, AND FANNY DEVOTED
TO HER AUNT BERTRAM, RETURNING TO EVERY FORMER OFFICE WITH MORE THAN
FORMER ZEAL, AND THINKING SHE COULD NEVER DO ENOUGH FOR ONE WHO SEEMED
SO MUCH TO WANT HER.

TO TALK OVER THE DREADFUL BUSINESS WITH FANNY, TALK AND LAMENT, WAS ALL
LADY BERTRAM'S CONSOLATION. TO BE LISTENED TO AND BORNE WITH, AND HEAR
THE VOICE OF KINDNESS AND SYMPATHY IN RETURN, WAS EVERYTHING THAT COULD
BE DONE FOR HER. TO BE OTHERWISE COMFORTED WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION. THE
CASE ADMITTED OF NO COMFORT. LADY BERTRAM DID NOT THINK DEEPLY, BUT,
GUIDED BY SIR THOMAS, SHE THOUGHT JUSTLY ON ALL IMPORTANT POINTS; AND
SHE SAW, THEREFORE, IN ALL ITS ENORMITY, WHAT HAD HAPPENED, AND NEITHER
ENDEAVOURED HERSELF, NOR REQUIRED FANNY TO ADVISE HER, TO THINK LITTLE
OF GUILT AND INFAMY.

HER AFFECTIONS WERE NOT ACUTE, NOR WAS HER MIND TENACIOUS. AFTER A TIME,
FANNY FOUND IT NOT IMPOSSIBLE TO DIRECT HER THOUGHTS TO OTHER SUBJECTS,
AND REVIVE SOME INTEREST IN THE USUAL OCCUPATIONS; BUT WHENEVER LADY
BERTRAM WAS FIXED ON THE EVENT, SHE COULD SEE IT ONLY IN ONE LIGHT, AS
COMPREHENDING THE LOSS OF A DAUGHTER, AND A DISGRACE NEVER TO BE WIPED
OFF.

FANNY LEARNT FROM HER ALL THE PARTICULARS WHICH HAD YET TRANSPIRED. HER
AUNT WAS NO VERY METHODICAL NARRATOR, BUT WITH THE HELP OF SOME LETTERS
TO AND FROM SIR THOMAS, AND WHAT SHE ALREADY KNEW HERSELF, AND COULD
REASONABLY COMBINE, SHE WAS SOON ABLE TO UNDERSTAND QUITE AS MUCH AS SHE
WISHED OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES ATTENDING THE STORY.

MRS. RUSHWORTH HAD GONE, FOR THE EASTER HOLIDAYS, TO TWICKENHAM, WITH
A FAMILY WHOM SHE HAD JUST GROWN INTIMATE WITH: A FAMILY OF LIVELY,
AGREEABLE MANNERS, AND PROBABLY OF MORALS AND DISCRETION TO SUIT, FOR TO
THEIR HOUSE MR. CRAWFORD HAD CONSTANT ACCESS AT ALL TIMES. HIS HAVING
BEEN IN THE SAME NEIGHBOURHOOD FANNY ALREADY KNEW. MR. RUSHWORTH HAD
BEEN GONE AT THIS TIME TO BATH, TO PASS A FEW DAYS WITH HIS MOTHER, AND
BRING HER BACK TO TOWN, AND MARIA WAS WITH THESE FRIENDS WITHOUT ANY
RESTRAINT, WITHOUT EVEN JULIA; FOR JULIA HAD REMOVED FROM WIMPOLE STREET
TWO OR THREE WEEKS BEFORE, ON A VISIT TO SOME RELATIONS OF SIR THOMAS;
A REMOVAL WHICH HER FATHER AND MOTHER WERE NOW DISPOSED TO ATTRIBUTE
TO SOME VIEW OF CONVENIENCE ON MR. YATES'S ACCOUNT. VERY SOON AFTER THE
RUSHWORTHS' RETURN TO WIMPOLE STREET, SIR THOMAS HAD RECEIVED A LETTER
FROM AN OLD AND MOST PARTICULAR FRIEND IN LONDON, WHO HEARING AND
WITNESSING A GOOD DEAL TO ALARM HIM IN THAT QUARTER, WROTE TO RECOMMEND
SIR THOMAS'S COMING TO LONDON HIMSELF, AND USING HIS INFLUENCE WITH HIS
DAUGHTER TO PUT AN END TO THE INTIMACY WHICH WAS ALREADY EXPOSING HER TO
UNPLEASANT REMARKS, AND EVIDENTLY MAKING MR. RUSHWORTH UNEASY.

SIR THOMAS WAS PREPARING TO ACT UPON THIS LETTER, WITHOUT COMMUNICATING
ITS CONTENTS TO ANY CREATURE AT MANSFIELD, WHEN IT WAS FOLLOWED BY
ANOTHER, SENT EXPRESS FROM THE SAME FRIEND, TO BREAK TO HIM THE ALMOST
DESPERATE SITUATION IN WHICH AFFAIRS THEN STOOD WITH THE YOUNG PEOPLE.
MRS. RUSHWORTH HAD LEFT HER HUSBAND'S HOUSE: MR. RUSHWORTH HAD BEEN
IN GREAT ANGER AND DISTRESS TO HIM (MR. HARDING) FOR HIS ADVICE; MR.
HARDING FEARED THERE HAD BEEN AT LEAST VERY FLAGRANT INDISCRETION.
THE MAIDSERVANT OF MRS. RUSHWORTH, SENIOR, THREATENED ALARMINGLY. HE
WAS DOING ALL IN HIS POWER TO QUIET EVERYTHING, WITH THE HOPE OF MRS.
RUSHWORTH'S RETURN, BUT WAS SO MUCH COUNTERACTED IN WIMPOLE STREET BY
THE INFLUENCE OF MR. RUSHWORTH'S MOTHER, THAT THE WORST CONSEQUENCES
MIGHT BE APPREHENDED.

THIS DREADFUL COMMUNICATION COULD NOT BE KEPT FROM THE REST OF THE
FAMILY. SIR THOMAS SET OFF, EDMUND WOULD GO WITH HIM, AND THE OTHERS HAD
BEEN LEFT IN A STATE OF WRETCHEDNESS, INFERIOR ONLY TO WHAT FOLLOWED
THE RECEIPT OF THE NEXT LETTERS FROM LONDON. EVERYTHING WAS BY THAT TIME
PUBLIC BEYOND A HOPE. THE SERVANT OF MRS. RUSHWORTH, THE MOTHER, HAD
EXPOSURE IN HER POWER, AND SUPPORTED BY HER MISTRESS, WAS NOT TO BE
SILENCED. THE TWO LADIES, EVEN IN THE SHORT TIME THEY HAD BEEN
TOGETHER, HAD DISAGREED; AND THE BITTERNESS OF THE ELDER AGAINST HER
DAUGHTER-IN-LAW MIGHT PERHAPS ARISE ALMOST AS MUCH FROM THE PERSONAL
DISRESPECT WITH WHICH SHE HAD HERSELF BEEN TREATED AS FROM SENSIBILITY
FOR HER SON.

HOWEVER THAT MIGHT BE, SHE WAS UNMANAGEABLE. BUT HAD SHE BEEN LESS
OBSTINATE, OR OF LESS WEIGHT WITH HER SON, WHO WAS ALWAYS GUIDED BY THE
LAST SPEAKER, BY THE PERSON WHO COULD GET HOLD OF AND SHUT HIM UP, THE
CASE WOULD STILL HAVE BEEN HOPELESS, FOR MRS. RUSHWORTH DID NOT APPEAR
AGAIN, AND THERE WAS EVERY REASON TO CONCLUDE HER TO BE CONCEALED
SOMEWHERE WITH MR. CRAWFORD, WHO HAD QUITTED HIS UNCLE'S HOUSE, AS FOR A
JOURNEY, ON THE VERY DAY OF HER ABSENTING HERSELF.

SIR THOMAS, HOWEVER, REMAINED YET A LITTLE LONGER IN TOWN, IN THE HOPE
OF DISCOVERING AND SNATCHING HER FROM FARTHER VICE, THOUGH ALL WAS LOST
ON THE SIDE OF CHARACTER.

HIS PRESENT STATE FANNY COULD HARDLY BEAR TO THINK OF. THERE WAS BUT
ONE OF HIS CHILDREN WHO WAS NOT AT THIS TIME A SOURCE OF MISERY TO
HIM. TOM'S COMPLAINTS HAD BEEN GREATLY HEIGHTENED BY THE SHOCK OF HIS
SISTER'S CONDUCT, AND HIS RECOVERY SO MUCH THROWN BACK BY IT, THAT EVEN
LADY BERTRAM HAD BEEN STRUCK BY THE DIFFERENCE, AND ALL HER ALARMS WERE
REGULARLY SENT OFF TO HER HUSBAND; AND JULIA'S ELOPEMENT, THE ADDITIONAL
BLOW WHICH HAD MET HIM ON HIS ARRIVAL IN LONDON, THOUGH ITS FORCE HAD
BEEN DEADENED AT THE MOMENT, MUST, SHE KNEW, BE SORELY FELT. SHE SAW
THAT IT WAS. HIS LETTERS EXPRESSED HOW MUCH HE DEPLORED IT. UNDER ANY
CIRCUMSTANCES IT WOULD HAVE BEEN AN UNWELCOME ALLIANCE; BUT TO HAVE IT
SO CLANDESTINELY FORMED, AND SUCH A PERIOD CHOSEN FOR ITS COMPLETION,
PLACED JULIA'S FEELINGS IN A MOST UNFAVOURABLE LIGHT, AND SEVERELY
AGGRAVATED THE FOLLY OF HER CHOICE. HE CALLED IT A BAD THING, DONE IN
THE WORST MANNER, AND AT THE WORST TIME; AND THOUGH JULIA WAS YET AS
MORE PARDONABLE THAN MARIA AS FOLLY THAN VICE, HE COULD NOT BUT
REGARD THE STEP SHE HAD TAKEN AS OPENING THE WORST PROBABILITIES OF A
CONCLUSION HEREAFTER LIKE HER SISTER'S. SUCH WAS HIS OPINION OF THE SET
INTO WHICH SHE HAD THROWN HERSELF.

FANNY FELT FOR HIM MOST ACUTELY. HE COULD HAVE NO COMFORT BUT IN EDMUND.
EVERY OTHER CHILD MUST BE RACKING HIS HEART. HIS DISPLEASURE AGAINST
HERSELF SHE TRUSTED, REASONING DIFFERENTLY FROM MRS. NORRIS, WOULD NOW
BE DONE AWAY. SHE SHOULD BE JUSTIFIED. MR. CRAWFORD WOULD HAVE FULLY
ACQUITTED HER CONDUCT IN REFUSING HIM; BUT THIS, THOUGH MOST MATERIAL
TO HERSELF, WOULD BE POOR CONSOLATION TO SIR THOMAS. HER UNCLE'S
DISPLEASURE WAS TERRIBLE TO HER; BUT WHAT COULD HER JUSTIFICATION OR HER
GRATITUDE AND ATTACHMENT DO FOR HIM? HIS STAY MUST BE ON EDMUND ALONE.

SHE WAS MISTAKEN, HOWEVER, IN SUPPOSING THAT EDMUND GAVE HIS FATHER NO
PRESENT PAIN. IT WAS OF A MUCH LESS POIGNANT NATURE THAN WHAT THE OTHERS
EXCITED; BUT SIR THOMAS WAS CONSIDERING HIS HAPPINESS AS VERY DEEPLY
INVOLVED IN THE OFFENCE OF HIS SISTER AND FRIEND; CUT OFF BY IT, AS
HE MUST BE, FROM THE WOMAN WHOM HE HAD BEEN PURSUING WITH UNDOUBTED
ATTACHMENT AND STRONG PROBABILITY OF SUCCESS; AND WHO, IN EVERYTHING BUT
THIS DESPICABLE BROTHER, WOULD HAVE BEEN SO ELIGIBLE A CONNEXION. HE WAS
AWARE OF WHAT EDMUND MUST BE SUFFERING ON HIS OWN BEHALF, IN ADDITION
TO ALL THE REST, WHEN THEY WERE IN TOWN: HE HAD SEEN OR CONJECTURED
HIS FEELINGS; AND, HAVING REASON TO THINK THAT ONE INTERVIEW WITH MISS
CRAWFORD HAD TAKEN PLACE, FROM WHICH EDMUND DERIVED ONLY INCREASED
DISTRESS, HAD BEEN AS ANXIOUS ON THAT ACCOUNT AS ON OTHERS TO GET HIM
OUT OF TOWN, AND HAD ENGAGED HIM IN TAKING FANNY HOME TO HER AUNT, WITH
A VIEW TO HIS RELIEF AND BENEFIT, NO LESS THAN THEIRS. FANNY WAS NOT IN
THE SECRET OF HER UNCLE'S FEELINGS, SIR THOMAS NOT IN THE SECRET OF MISS
CRAWFORD'S CHARACTER. HAD HE BEEN PRIVY TO HER CONVERSATION WITH HIS
SON, HE WOULD NOT HAVE WISHED HER TO BELONG TO HIM, THOUGH HER TWENTY
THOUSAND POUNDS HAD BEEN FORTY.

THAT EDMUND MUST BE FOR EVER DIVIDED FROM MISS CRAWFORD DID NOT ADMIT
OF A DOUBT WITH FANNY; AND YET, TILL SHE KNEW THAT HE FELT THE SAME, HER
OWN CONVICTION WAS INSUFFICIENT. SHE THOUGHT HE DID, BUT SHE WANTED TO
BE ASSURED OF IT. IF HE WOULD NOW SPEAK TO HER WITH THE UNRESERVE WHICH
HAD SOMETIMES BEEN TOO MUCH FOR HER BEFORE, IT WOULD BE MOST CONSOLING;
BUT THAT SHE FOUND WAS NOT TO BE. SHE SELDOM SAW HIM: NEVER ALONE. HE
PROBABLY AVOIDED BEING ALONE WITH HER. WHAT WAS TO BE INFERRED? THAT
HIS JUDGMENT SUBMITTED TO ALL HIS OWN PECULIAR AND BITTER SHARE OF THIS
FAMILY AFFLICTION, BUT THAT IT WAS TOO KEENLY FELT TO BE A SUBJECT OF
THE SLIGHTEST COMMUNICATION. THIS MUST BE HIS STATE. HE YIELDED, BUT IT
WAS WITH AGONIES WHICH DID NOT ADMIT OF SPEECH. LONG, LONG WOULD IT BE
ERE MISS CRAWFORD'S NAME PASSED HIS LIPS AGAIN, OR SHE COULD HOPE FOR A
RENEWAL OF SUCH CONFIDENTIAL INTERCOURSE AS HAD BEEN.

IT WAS LONG. THEY REACHED MANSFIELD ON THURSDAY, AND IT WAS NOT TILL
SUNDAY EVENING THAT EDMUND BEGAN TO TALK TO HER ON THE SUBJECT. SITTING
WITH HER ON SUNDAY EVENING--A WET SUNDAY EVENING--THE VERY TIME OF
ALL OTHERS WHEN, IF A FRIEND IS AT HAND, THE HEART MUST BE OPENED, AND
EVERYTHING TOLD; NO ONE ELSE IN THE ROOM, EXCEPT HIS MOTHER, WHO,
AFTER HEARING AN AFFECTING SERMON, HAD CRIED HERSELF TO SLEEP, IT WAS
IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO SPEAK; AND SO, WITH THE USUAL BEGINNINGS, HARDLY TO
BE TRACED AS TO WHAT CAME FIRST, AND THE USUAL DECLARATION THAT IF SHE
WOULD LISTEN TO HIM FOR A FEW MINUTES, HE SHOULD BE VERY BRIEF, AND
CERTAINLY NEVER TAX HER KINDNESS IN THE SAME WAY AGAIN; SHE NEED NOT
FEAR A REPETITION; IT WOULD BE A SUBJECT PROHIBITED ENTIRELY: HE ENTERED
UPON THE LUXURY OF RELATING CIRCUMSTANCES AND SENSATIONS OF THE FIRST
INTEREST TO HIMSELF, TO ONE OF WHOSE AFFECTIONATE SYMPATHY HE WAS QUITE
CONVINCED.

HOW FANNY LISTENED, WITH WHAT CURIOSITY AND CONCERN, WHAT PAIN AND WHAT
DELIGHT, HOW THE AGITATION OF HIS VOICE WAS WATCHED, AND HOW CAREFULLY
HER OWN EYES WERE FIXED ON ANY OBJECT BUT HIMSELF, MAY BE IMAGINED. THE
OPENING WAS ALARMING. HE HAD SEEN MISS CRAWFORD. HE HAD BEEN INVITED TO
SEE HER. HE HAD RECEIVED A NOTE FROM LADY STORNAWAY TO BEG HIM TO CALL;
AND REGARDING IT AS WHAT WAS MEANT TO BE THE LAST, LAST INTERVIEW
OF FRIENDSHIP, AND INVESTING HER WITH ALL THE FEELINGS OF SHAME AND
WRETCHEDNESS WHICH CRAWFORD'S SISTER OUGHT TO HAVE KNOWN, HE HAD GONE TO
HER IN SUCH A STATE OF MIND, SO SOFTENED, SO DEVOTED, AS MADE IT FOR A
FEW MOMENTS IMPOSSIBLE TO FANNY'S FEARS THAT IT SHOULD BE THE LAST. BUT
AS HE PROCEEDED IN HIS STORY, THESE FEARS WERE OVER. SHE HAD MET HIM,
HE SAID, WITH A SERIOUS--CERTAINLY A SERIOUS--EVEN AN AGITATED AIR;
BUT BEFORE HE HAD BEEN ABLE TO SPEAK ONE INTELLIGIBLE SENTENCE, SHE HAD
INTRODUCED THE SUBJECT IN A MANNER WHICH HE OWNED HAD SHOCKED HIM. "'I
HEARD YOU WERE IN TOWN,' SAID SHE; 'I WANTED TO SEE YOU. LET US TALK
OVER THIS SAD BUSINESS. WHAT CAN EQUAL THE FOLLY OF OUR TWO RELATIONS?'
I COULD NOT ANSWER, BUT I BELIEVE MY LOOKS SPOKE. SHE FELT REPROVED.
SOMETIMES HOW QUICK TO FEEL! WITH A GRAVER LOOK AND VOICE SHE THEN
ADDED, 'I DO NOT MEAN TO DEFEND HENRY AT YOUR SISTER'S EXPENSE.' SO
SHE BEGAN, BUT HOW SHE WENT ON, FANNY, IS NOT FIT, IS HARDLY FIT TO BE
REPEATED TO YOU. I CANNOT RECALL ALL HER WORDS. I WOULD NOT DWELL UPON
THEM IF I COULD. THEIR SUBSTANCE WAS GREAT ANGER AT THE FOLLY OF EACH.
SHE REPROBATED HER BROTHER'S FOLLY IN BEING DRAWN ON BY A WOMAN WHOM HE
HAD NEVER CARED FOR, TO DO WHAT MUST LOSE HIM THE WOMAN HE ADORED; BUT
STILL MORE THE FOLLY OF POOR MARIA, IN SACRIFICING SUCH A SITUATION,
PLUNGING INTO SUCH DIFFICULTIES, UNDER THE IDEA OF BEING REALLY LOVED
BY A MAN WHO HAD LONG AGO MADE HIS INDIFFERENCE CLEAR. GUESS WHAT I MUST
HAVE FELT. TO HEAR THE WOMAN WHOM--NO HARSHER NAME THAN FOLLY GIVEN!
SO VOLUNTARILY, SO FREELY, SO COOLLY TO CANVASS IT! NO RELUCTANCE, NO
HORROR, NO FEMININE, SHALL I SAY, NO MODEST LOATHINGS? THIS IS WHAT THE
WORLD DOES. FOR WHERE, FANNY, SHALL WE FIND A WOMAN WHOM NATURE HAD SO
RICHLY ENDOWED? SPOILT, SPOILT!"

AFTER A LITTLE REFLECTION, HE WENT ON WITH A SORT OF DESPERATE CALMNESS.
"I WILL TELL YOU EVERYTHING, AND THEN HAVE DONE FOR EVER. SHE SAW IT
ONLY AS FOLLY, AND THAT FOLLY STAMPED ONLY BY EXPOSURE. THE WANT OF
COMMON DISCRETION, OF CAUTION: HIS GOING DOWN TO RICHMOND FOR THE WHOLE
TIME OF HER BEING AT TWICKENHAM; HER PUTTING HERSELF IN THE POWER OF
A SERVANT; IT WAS THE DETECTION, IN SHORT--OH, FANNY! IT WAS THE
DETECTION, NOT THE OFFENCE, WHICH SHE REPROBATED. IT WAS THE IMPRUDENCE
WHICH HAD BROUGHT THINGS TO EXTREMITY, AND OBLIGED HER BROTHER TO GIVE
UP EVERY DEARER PLAN IN ORDER TO FLY WITH HER."

HE STOPT. "AND WHAT," SAID FANNY (BELIEVING HERSELF REQUIRED TO SPEAK),
"WHAT COULD YOU SAY?"

"NOTHING, NOTHING TO BE UNDERSTOOD. I WAS LIKE A MAN STUNNED. SHE
WENT ON, BEGAN TO TALK OF YOU; YES, THEN SHE BEGAN TO TALK OF YOU,
REGRETTING, AS WELL SHE MIGHT, THE LOSS OF SUCH A--. THERE SHE SPOKE
VERY RATIONALLY. BUT SHE HAS ALWAYS DONE JUSTICE TO YOU. 'HE HAS THROWN
AWAY,' SAID SHE, 'SUCH A WOMAN AS HE WILL NEVER SEE AGAIN. SHE WOULD
HAVE FIXED HIM; SHE WOULD HAVE MADE HIM HAPPY FOR EVER.' MY DEAREST
FANNY, I AM GIVING YOU, I HOPE, MORE PLEASURE THAN PAIN BY THIS
RETROSPECT OF WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN--BUT WHAT NEVER CAN BE NOW. YOU DO
NOT WISH ME TO BE SILENT? IF YOU DO, GIVE ME BUT A LOOK, A WORD, AND I
HAVE DONE."

NO LOOK OR WORD WAS GIVEN.

"THANK GOD," SAID HE. "WE WERE ALL DISPOSED TO WONDER, BUT IT SEEMS TO
HAVE BEEN THE MERCIFUL APPOINTMENT OF PROVIDENCE THAT THE HEART WHICH
KNEW NO GUILE SHOULD NOT SUFFER. SHE SPOKE OF YOU WITH HIGH PRAISE AND
WARM AFFECTION; YET, EVEN HERE, THERE WAS ALLOY, A DASH OF EVIL; FOR IN
THE MIDST OF IT SHE COULD EXCLAIM, 'WHY WOULD NOT SHE HAVE HIM? IT IS
ALL HER FAULT. SIMPLE GIRL! I SHALL NEVER FORGIVE HER. HAD SHE ACCEPTED
HIM AS SHE OUGHT, THEY MIGHT NOW HAVE BEEN ON THE POINT OF MARRIAGE, AND
HENRY WOULD HAVE BEEN TOO HAPPY AND TOO BUSY TO WANT ANY OTHER OBJECT.
HE WOULD HAVE TAKEN NO PAINS TO BE ON TERMS WITH MRS. RUSHWORTH AGAIN.
IT WOULD HAVE ALL ENDED IN A REGULAR STANDING FLIRTATION, IN YEARLY
MEETINGS AT SOTHERTON AND EVERINGHAM.' COULD YOU HAVE BELIEVED IT
POSSIBLE? BUT THE CHARM IS BROKEN. MY EYES ARE OPENED."

"CRUEL!" SAID FANNY, "QUITE CRUEL. AT SUCH A MOMENT TO GIVE WAY TO
GAIETY, TO SPEAK WITH LIGHTNESS, AND TO YOU! ABSOLUTE CRUELTY."

"CRUELTY, DO YOU CALL IT? WE DIFFER THERE. NO, HERS IS NOT A CRUEL
NATURE. I DO NOT CONSIDER HER AS MEANING TO WOUND MY FEELINGS. THE EVIL
LIES YET DEEPER: IN HER TOTAL IGNORANCE, UNSUSPICIOUSNESS OF THERE BEING
SUCH FEELINGS; IN A PERVERSION OF MIND WHICH MADE IT NATURAL TO HER TO
TREAT THE SUBJECT AS SHE DID. SHE WAS SPEAKING ONLY AS SHE HAD BEEN USED
TO HEAR OTHERS SPEAK, AS SHE IMAGINED EVERYBODY ELSE WOULD SPEAK. HERS
ARE NOT FAULTS OF TEMPER. SHE WOULD NOT VOLUNTARILY GIVE UNNECESSARY
PAIN TO ANY ONE, AND THOUGH I MAY DECEIVE MYSELF, I CANNOT BUT THINK
THAT FOR ME, FOR MY FEELINGS, SHE WOULD--HERS ARE FAULTS OF PRINCIPLE,
FANNY; OF BLUNTED DELICACY AND A CORRUPTED, VITIATED MIND. PERHAPS IT
IS BEST FOR ME, SINCE IT LEAVES ME SO LITTLE TO REGRET. NOT SO, HOWEVER.
GLADLY WOULD I SUBMIT TO ALL THE INCREASED PAIN OF LOSING HER, RATHER
THAN HAVE TO THINK OF HER AS I DO. I TOLD HER SO."

"DID YOU?"

"YES; WHEN I LEFT HER I TOLD HER SO."

"HOW LONG WERE YOU TOGETHER?"

"FIVE-AND-TWENTY MINUTES. WELL, SHE WENT ON TO SAY THAT WHAT REMAINED
NOW TO BE DONE WAS TO BRING ABOUT A MARRIAGE BETWEEN THEM. SHE SPOKE OF
IT, FANNY, WITH A STEADIER VOICE THAN I CAN." HE WAS OBLIGED TO PAUSE
MORE THAN ONCE AS HE CONTINUED. "'WE MUST PERSUADE HENRY TO MARRY
HER,' SAID SHE; 'AND WHAT WITH HONOUR, AND THE CERTAINTY OF HAVING SHUT
HIMSELF OUT FOR EVER FROM FANNY, I DO NOT DESPAIR OF IT. FANNY HE MUST
GIVE UP. I DO NOT THINK THAT EVEN HE COULD NOW HOPE TO SUCCEED WITH
ONE OF HER STAMP, AND THEREFORE I HOPE WE MAY FIND NO INSUPERABLE
DIFFICULTY. MY INFLUENCE, WHICH IS NOT SMALL SHALL ALL GO THAT WAY; AND
WHEN ONCE MARRIED, AND PROPERLY SUPPORTED BY HER OWN FAMILY, PEOPLE OF
RESPECTABILITY AS THEY ARE, SHE MAY RECOVER HER FOOTING IN SOCIETY TO A
CERTAIN DEGREE. IN SOME CIRCLES, WE KNOW, SHE WOULD NEVER BE ADMITTED,
BUT WITH GOOD DINNERS, AND LARGE PARTIES, THERE WILL ALWAYS BE THOSE
WHO WILL BE GLAD OF HER ACQUAINTANCE; AND THERE IS, UNDOUBTEDLY, MORE
LIBERALITY AND CANDOUR ON THOSE POINTS THAN FORMERLY. WHAT I ADVISE
IS, THAT YOUR FATHER BE QUIET. DO NOT LET HIM INJURE HIS OWN CAUSE BY
INTERFERENCE. PERSUADE HIM TO LET THINGS TAKE THEIR COURSE. IF BY ANY
OFFICIOUS EXERTIONS OF HIS, SHE IS INDUCED TO LEAVE HENRY'S PROTECTION,
THERE WILL BE MUCH LESS CHANCE OF HIS MARRYING HER THAN IF SHE REMAIN
WITH HIM. I KNOW HOW HE IS LIKELY TO BE INFLUENCED. LET SIR THOMAS TRUST
TO HIS HONOUR AND COMPASSION, AND IT MAY ALL END WELL; BUT IF HE GET HIS
DAUGHTER AWAY, IT WILL BE DESTROYING THE CHIEF HOLD.'"

AFTER REPEATING THIS, EDMUND WAS SO MUCH AFFECTED THAT FANNY, WATCHING
HIM WITH SILENT, BUT MOST TENDER CONCERN, WAS ALMOST SORRY THAT THE
SUBJECT HAD BEEN ENTERED ON AT ALL. IT WAS LONG BEFORE HE COULD SPEAK
AGAIN. AT LAST, "NOW, FANNY," SAID HE, "I SHALL SOON HAVE DONE. I HAVE
TOLD YOU THE SUBSTANCE OF ALL THAT SHE SAID. AS SOON AS I COULD SPEAK,
I REPLIED THAT I HAD NOT SUPPOSED IT POSSIBLE, COMING IN SUCH A STATE OF
MIND INTO THAT HOUSE AS I HAD DONE, THAT ANYTHING COULD OCCUR TO MAKE
ME SUFFER MORE, BUT THAT SHE HAD BEEN INFLICTING DEEPER WOUNDS IN ALMOST
EVERY SENTENCE. THAT THOUGH I HAD, IN THE COURSE OF OUR ACQUAINTANCE,
BEEN OFTEN SENSIBLE OF SOME DIFFERENCE IN OUR OPINIONS, ON POINTS,
TOO, OF SOME MOMENT, IT HAD NOT ENTERED MY IMAGINATION TO CONCEIVE THE
DIFFERENCE COULD BE SUCH AS SHE HAD NOW PROVED IT. THAT THE MANNER IN
WHICH SHE TREATED THE DREADFUL CRIME COMMITTED BY HER BROTHER AND MY
SISTER (WITH WHOM LAY THE GREATER SEDUCTION I PRETENDED NOT TO SAY),
BUT THE MANNER IN WHICH SHE SPOKE OF THE CRIME ITSELF, GIVING IT EVERY
REPROACH BUT THE RIGHT; CONSIDERING ITS ILL CONSEQUENCES ONLY AS THEY
WERE TO BE BRAVED OR OVERBORNE BY A DEFIANCE OF DECENCY AND IMPUDENCE IN
WRONG; AND LAST OF ALL, AND ABOVE ALL, RECOMMENDING TO US A COMPLIANCE,
A COMPROMISE, AN ACQUIESCENCE IN THE CONTINUANCE OF THE SIN, ON THE
CHANCE OF A MARRIAGE WHICH, THINKING AS I NOW THOUGHT OF HER BROTHER,
SHOULD RATHER BE PREVENTED THAN SOUGHT; ALL THIS TOGETHER MOST
GRIEVOUSLY CONVINCED ME THAT I HAD NEVER UNDERSTOOD HER BEFORE, AND
THAT, AS FAR AS RELATED TO MIND, IT HAD BEEN THE CREATURE OF MY OWN
IMAGINATION, NOT MISS CRAWFORD, THAT I HAD BEEN TOO APT TO DWELL ON
FOR MANY MONTHS PAST. THAT, PERHAPS, IT WAS BEST FOR ME; I HAD LESS TO
REGRET IN SACRIFICING A FRIENDSHIP, FEELINGS, HOPES WHICH MUST, AT ANY
RATE, HAVE BEEN TORN FROM ME NOW. AND YET, THAT I MUST AND WOULD CONFESS
THAT, COULD I HAVE RESTORED HER TO WHAT SHE HAD APPEARED TO ME BEFORE,
I WOULD INFINITELY PREFER ANY INCREASE OF THE PAIN OF PARTING, FOR THE
SAKE OF CARRYING WITH ME THE RIGHT OF TENDERNESS AND ESTEEM. THIS IS
WHAT I SAID, THE PURPORT OF IT; BUT, AS YOU MAY IMAGINE, NOT SPOKEN
SO COLLECTEDLY OR METHODICALLY AS I HAVE REPEATED IT TO YOU. SHE WAS
ASTONISHED, EXCEEDINGLY ASTONISHED--MORE THAN ASTONISHED. I SAW HER
CHANGE COUNTENANCE. SHE TURNED EXTREMELY RED. I IMAGINED I SAW A
MIXTURE OF MANY FEELINGS: A GREAT, THOUGH SHORT STRUGGLE; HALF A WISH OF
YIELDING TO TRUTHS, HALF A SENSE OF SHAME, BUT HABIT, HABIT CARRIED
IT. SHE WOULD HAVE LAUGHED IF SHE COULD. IT WAS A SORT OF LAUGH, AS SHE
ANSWERED, 'A PRETTY GOOD LECTURE, UPON MY WORD. WAS IT PART OF YOUR LAST
SERMON? AT THIS RATE YOU WILL SOON REFORM EVERYBODY AT MANSFIELD AND
THORNTON LACEY; AND WHEN I HEAR OF YOU NEXT, IT MAY BE AS A CELEBRATED
PREACHER IN SOME GREAT SOCIETY OF METHODISTS, OR AS A MISSIONARY INTO
FOREIGN PARTS.' SHE TRIED TO SPEAK CARELESSLY, BUT SHE WAS NOT SO
CARELESS AS SHE WANTED TO APPEAR. I ONLY SAID IN REPLY, THAT FROM MY
HEART I WISHED HER WELL, AND EARNESTLY HOPED THAT SHE MIGHT SOON LEARN
TO THINK MORE JUSTLY, AND NOT OWE THE MOST VALUABLE KNOWLEDGE WE COULD
ANY OF US ACQUIRE, THE KNOWLEDGE OF OURSELVES AND OF OUR DUTY, TO THE
LESSONS OF AFFLICTION, AND IMMEDIATELY LEFT THE ROOM. I HAD GONE A FEW
STEPS, FANNY, WHEN I HEARD THE DOOR OPEN BEHIND ME. 'MR. BERTRAM,' SAID
SHE. I LOOKED BACK. 'MR. BERTRAM,' SAID SHE, WITH A SMILE; BUT IT WAS
A SMILE ILL-SUITED TO THE CONVERSATION THAT HAD PASSED, A SAUCY PLAYFUL
SMILE, SEEMING TO INVITE IN ORDER TO SUBDUE ME; AT LEAST IT APPEARED SO
TO ME. I RESISTED; IT WAS THE IMPULSE OF THE MOMENT TO RESIST, AND STILL
WALKED ON. I HAVE SINCE, SOMETIMES, FOR A MOMENT, REGRETTED THAT I DID
NOT GO BACK, BUT I KNOW I WAS RIGHT, AND SUCH HAS BEEN THE END OF OUR
ACQUAINTANCE. AND WHAT AN ACQUAINTANCE HAS IT BEEN! HOW HAVE I BEEN
DECEIVED! EQUALLY IN BROTHER AND SISTER DECEIVED! I THANK YOU FOR YOUR
PATIENCE, FANNY. THIS HAS BEEN THE GREATEST RELIEF, AND NOW WE WILL HAVE
DONE."

AND SUCH WAS FANNY'S DEPENDENCE ON HIS WORDS, THAT FOR FIVE MINUTES
SHE THOUGHT THEY HAD DONE. THEN, HOWEVER, IT ALL CAME ON AGAIN, OR
SOMETHING VERY LIKE IT, AND NOTHING LESS THAN LADY BERTRAM'S ROUSING
THOROUGHLY UP COULD REALLY CLOSE SUCH A CONVERSATION. TILL THAT
HAPPENED, THEY CONTINUED TO TALK OF MISS CRAWFORD ALONE, AND HOW SHE HAD
ATTACHED HIM, AND HOW DELIGHTFUL NATURE HAD MADE HER, AND HOW EXCELLENT
SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN, HAD SHE FALLEN INTO GOOD HANDS EARLIER. FANNY, NOW
AT LIBERTY TO SPEAK OPENLY, FELT MORE THAN JUSTIFIED IN ADDING TO
HIS KNOWLEDGE OF HER REAL CHARACTER, BY SOME HINT OF WHAT SHARE HIS
BROTHER'S STATE OF HEALTH MIGHT BE SUPPOSED TO HAVE IN HER WISH FOR A
COMPLETE RECONCILIATION. THIS WAS NOT AN AGREEABLE INTIMATION. NATURE
RESISTED IT FOR A WHILE. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A VAST DEAL PLEASANTER TO
HAVE HAD HER MORE DISINTERESTED IN HER ATTACHMENT; BUT HIS VANITY WAS
NOT OF A STRENGTH TO FIGHT LONG AGAINST REASON. HE SUBMITTED TO BELIEVE
THAT TOM'S ILLNESS HAD INFLUENCED HER, ONLY RESERVING FOR HIMSELF THIS
CONSOLING THOUGHT, THAT CONSIDERING THE MANY COUNTERACTIONS OF OPPOSING
HABITS, SHE HAD CERTAINLY BEEN MORE ATTACHED TO HIM THAN COULD HAVE
BEEN EXPECTED, AND FOR HIS SAKE BEEN MORE NEAR DOING RIGHT. FANNY
THOUGHT EXACTLY THE SAME; AND THEY WERE ALSO QUITE AGREED IN THEIR
OPINION OF THE LASTING EFFECT, THE INDELIBLE IMPRESSION, WHICH SUCH
A DISAPPOINTMENT MUST MAKE ON HIS MIND. TIME WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY ABATE
SOMEWHAT OF HIS SUFFERINGS, BUT STILL IT WAS A SORT OF THING WHICH HE
NEVER COULD GET ENTIRELY THE BETTER OF; AND AS TO HIS EVER MEETING WITH
ANY OTHER WOMAN WHO COULD--IT WAS TOO IMPOSSIBLE TO BE NAMED BUT WITH
INDIGNATION. FANNY'S FRIENDSHIP WAS ALL THAT HE HAD TO CLING TO.



CHAPTER XLVIII

LET OTHER PENS DWELL ON GUILT AND MISERY. I QUIT SUCH ODIOUS SUBJECTS
AS SOON AS I CAN, IMPATIENT TO RESTORE EVERYBODY, NOT GREATLY IN FAULT
THEMSELVES, TO TOLERABLE COMFORT, AND TO HAVE DONE WITH ALL THE REST.

MY FANNY, INDEED, AT THIS VERY TIME, I HAVE THE SATISFACTION OF KNOWING,
MUST HAVE BEEN HAPPY IN SPITE OF EVERYTHING. SHE MUST HAVE BEEN A HAPPY
CREATURE IN SPITE OF ALL THAT SHE FELT, OR THOUGHT SHE FELT, FOR THE
DISTRESS OF THOSE AROUND HER. SHE HAD SOURCES OF DELIGHT THAT MUST FORCE
THEIR WAY. SHE WAS RETURNED TO MANSFIELD PARK, SHE WAS USEFUL, SHE WAS
BELOVED; SHE WAS SAFE FROM MR. CRAWFORD; AND WHEN SIR THOMAS CAME BACK
SHE HAD EVERY PROOF THAT COULD BE GIVEN IN HIS THEN MELANCHOLY STATE OF
SPIRITS, OF HIS PERFECT APPROBATION AND INCREASED REGARD; AND HAPPY AS
ALL THIS MUST MAKE HER, SHE WOULD STILL HAVE BEEN HAPPY WITHOUT ANY OF
IT, FOR EDMUND WAS NO LONGER THE DUPE OF MISS CRAWFORD.

IT IS TRUE THAT EDMUND WAS VERY FAR FROM HAPPY HIMSELF. HE WAS SUFFERING
FROM DISAPPOINTMENT AND REGRET, GRIEVING OVER WHAT WAS, AND WISHING FOR
WHAT COULD NEVER BE. SHE KNEW IT WAS SO, AND WAS SORRY; BUT IT WAS WITH
A SORROW SO FOUNDED ON SATISFACTION, SO TENDING TO EASE, AND SO MUCH IN
HARMONY WITH EVERY DEAREST SENSATION, THAT THERE ARE FEW WHO MIGHT NOT
HAVE BEEN GLAD TO EXCHANGE THEIR GREATEST GAIETY FOR IT.

SIR THOMAS, POOR SIR THOMAS, A PARENT, AND CONSCIOUS OF ERRORS IN HIS
OWN CONDUCT AS A PARENT, WAS THE LONGEST TO SUFFER. HE FELT THAT HE
OUGHT NOT TO HAVE ALLOWED THE MARRIAGE; THAT HIS DAUGHTER'S SENTIMENTS
HAD BEEN SUFFICIENTLY KNOWN TO HIM TO RENDER HIM CULPABLE IN AUTHORISING
IT; THAT IN SO DOING HE HAD SACRIFICED THE RIGHT TO THE EXPEDIENT, AND
BEEN GOVERNED BY MOTIVES OF SELFISHNESS AND WORLDLY WISDOM. THESE WERE
REFLECTIONS THAT REQUIRED SOME TIME TO SOFTEN; BUT TIME WILL DO ALMOST
EVERYTHING; AND THOUGH LITTLE COMFORT AROSE ON MRS. RUSHWORTH'S SIDE FOR
THE MISERY SHE HAD OCCASIONED, COMFORT WAS TO BE FOUND GREATER THAN
HE HAD SUPPOSED IN HIS OTHER CHILDREN. JULIA'S MATCH BECAME A LESS
DESPERATE BUSINESS THAN HE HAD CONSIDERED IT AT FIRST. SHE WAS HUMBLE,
AND WISHING TO BE FORGIVEN; AND MR. YATES, DESIROUS OF BEING REALLY
RECEIVED INTO THE FAMILY, WAS DISPOSED TO LOOK UP TO HIM AND BE GUIDED.
HE WAS NOT VERY SOLID; BUT THERE WAS A HOPE OF HIS BECOMING LESS
TRIFLING, OF HIS BEING AT LEAST TOLERABLY DOMESTIC AND QUIET; AND AT ANY
RATE, THERE WAS COMFORT IN FINDING HIS ESTATE RATHER MORE, AND HIS DEBTS
MUCH LESS, THAN HE HAD FEARED, AND IN BEING CONSULTED AND TREATED AS
THE FRIEND BEST WORTH ATTENDING TO. THERE WAS COMFORT ALSO IN TOM, WHO
GRADUALLY REGAINED HIS HEALTH, WITHOUT REGAINING THE THOUGHTLESSNESS AND
SELFISHNESS OF HIS PREVIOUS HABITS. HE WAS THE BETTER FOR EVER FOR HIS
ILLNESS. HE HAD SUFFERED, AND HE HAD LEARNED TO THINK: TWO ADVANTAGES
THAT HE HAD NEVER KNOWN BEFORE; AND THE SELF-REPROACH ARISING FROM THE
DEPLORABLE EVENT IN WIMPOLE STREET, TO WHICH HE FELT HIMSELF ACCESSORY
BY ALL THE DANGEROUS INTIMACY OF HIS UNJUSTIFIABLE THEATRE, MADE AN
IMPRESSION ON HIS MIND WHICH, AT THE AGE OF SIX-AND-TWENTY, WITH NO WANT
OF SENSE OR GOOD COMPANIONS, WAS DURABLE IN ITS HAPPY EFFECTS. HE BECAME
WHAT HE OUGHT TO BE: USEFUL TO HIS FATHER, STEADY AND QUIET, AND NOT
LIVING MERELY FOR HIMSELF.

HERE WAS COMFORT INDEED! AND QUITE AS SOON AS SIR THOMAS COULD PLACE
DEPENDENCE ON SUCH SOURCES OF GOOD, EDMUND WAS CONTRIBUTING TO HIS
FATHER'S EASE BY IMPROVEMENT IN THE ONLY POINT IN WHICH HE HAD GIVEN
HIM PAIN BEFORE--IMPROVEMENT IN HIS SPIRITS. AFTER WANDERING ABOUT AND
SITTING UNDER TREES WITH FANNY ALL THE SUMMER EVENINGS, HE HAD SO WELL
TALKED HIS MIND INTO SUBMISSION AS TO BE VERY TOLERABLY CHEERFUL AGAIN.

THESE WERE THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND THE HOPES WHICH GRADUALLY BROUGHT THEIR
ALLEVIATION TO SIR THOMAS, DEADENING HIS SENSE OF WHAT WAS LOST, AND
IN PART RECONCILING HIM TO HIMSELF; THOUGH THE ANGUISH ARISING FROM THE
CONVICTION OF HIS OWN ERRORS IN THE EDUCATION OF HIS DAUGHTERS WAS NEVER
TO BE ENTIRELY DONE AWAY.

TOO LATE HE BECAME AWARE HOW UNFAVOURABLE TO THE CHARACTER OF ANY YOUNG
PEOPLE MUST BE THE TOTALLY OPPOSITE TREATMENT WHICH MARIA AND JULIA HAD
BEEN ALWAYS EXPERIENCING AT HOME, WHERE THE EXCESSIVE INDULGENCE AND
FLATTERY OF THEIR AUNT HAD BEEN CONTINUALLY CONTRASTED WITH HIS OWN
SEVERITY. HE SAW HOW ILL HE HAD JUDGED, IN EXPECTING TO COUNTERACT WHAT
WAS WRONG IN MRS. NORRIS BY ITS REVERSE IN HIMSELF; CLEARLY SAW THAT HE
HAD BUT INCREASED THE EVIL BY TEACHING THEM TO REPRESS THEIR SPIRITS IN
HIS PRESENCE SO AS TO MAKE THEIR REAL DISPOSITION UNKNOWN TO HIM, AND
SENDING THEM FOR ALL THEIR INDULGENCES TO A PERSON WHO HAD BEEN ABLE TO
ATTACH THEM ONLY BY THE BLINDNESS OF HER AFFECTION, AND THE EXCESS OF
HER PRAISE.

HERE HAD BEEN GRIEVOUS MISMANAGEMENT; BUT, BAD AS IT WAS, HE GRADUALLY
GREW TO FEEL THAT IT HAD NOT BEEN THE MOST DIREFUL MISTAKE IN HIS PLAN
OF EDUCATION. SOMETHING MUST HAVE BEEN WANTING WITHIN, OR TIME WOULD
HAVE WORN AWAY MUCH OF ITS ILL EFFECT. HE FEARED THAT PRINCIPLE, ACTIVE
PRINCIPLE, HAD BEEN WANTING; THAT THEY HAD NEVER BEEN PROPERLY TAUGHT
TO GOVERN THEIR INCLINATIONS AND TEMPERS BY THAT SENSE OF DUTY WHICH CAN
ALONE SUFFICE. THEY HAD BEEN INSTRUCTED THEORETICALLY IN THEIR RELIGION,
BUT NEVER REQUIRED TO BRING IT INTO DAILY PRACTICE. TO BE DISTINGUISHED
FOR ELEGANCE AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS, THE AUTHORISED OBJECT OF THEIR YOUTH,
COULD HAVE HAD NO USEFUL INFLUENCE THAT WAY, NO MORAL EFFECT ON THE
MIND. HE HAD MEANT THEM TO BE GOOD, BUT HIS CARES HAD BEEN DIRECTED TO
THE UNDERSTANDING AND MANNERS, NOT THE DISPOSITION; AND OF THE NECESSITY
OF SELF-DENIAL AND HUMILITY, HE FEARED THEY HAD NEVER HEARD FROM ANY
LIPS THAT COULD PROFIT THEM.

BITTERLY DID HE DEPLORE A DEFICIENCY WHICH NOW HE COULD SCARCELY
COMPREHEND TO HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE. WRETCHEDLY DID HE FEEL, THAT WITH ALL
THE COST AND CARE OF AN ANXIOUS AND EXPENSIVE EDUCATION, HE HAD BROUGHT
UP HIS DAUGHTERS WITHOUT THEIR UNDERSTANDING THEIR FIRST DUTIES, OR HIS
BEING ACQUAINTED WITH THEIR CHARACTER AND TEMPER.

THE HIGH SPIRIT AND STRONG PASSIONS OF MRS. RUSHWORTH, ESPECIALLY, WERE
MADE KNOWN TO HIM ONLY IN THEIR SAD RESULT. SHE WAS NOT TO BE PREVAILED
ON TO LEAVE MR. CRAWFORD. SHE HOPED TO MARRY HIM, AND THEY CONTINUED
TOGETHER TILL SHE WAS OBLIGED TO BE CONVINCED THAT SUCH HOPE WAS VAIN,
AND TILL THE DISAPPOINTMENT AND WRETCHEDNESS ARISING FROM THE CONVICTION
RENDERED HER TEMPER SO BAD, AND HER FEELINGS FOR HIM SO LIKE HATRED,
AS TO MAKE THEM FOR A WHILE EACH OTHER'S PUNISHMENT, AND THEN INDUCE A
VOLUNTARY SEPARATION.

SHE HAD LIVED WITH HIM TO BE REPROACHED AS THE RUIN OF ALL HIS HAPPINESS
IN FANNY, AND CARRIED AWAY NO BETTER CONSOLATION IN LEAVING HIM THAN
THAT SHE HAD DIVIDED THEM. WHAT CAN EXCEED THE MISERY OF SUCH A MIND
IN SUCH A SITUATION?

MR. RUSHWORTH HAD NO DIFFICULTY IN PROCURING A DIVORCE; AND SO ENDED A
MARRIAGE CONTRACTED UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES AS TO MAKE ANY BETTER END
THE EFFECT OF GOOD LUCK NOT TO BE RECKONED ON. SHE HAD DESPISED HIM,
AND LOVED ANOTHER; AND HE HAD BEEN VERY MUCH AWARE THAT IT WAS SO. THE
INDIGNITIES OF STUPIDITY, AND THE DISAPPOINTMENTS OF SELFISH PASSION,
CAN EXCITE LITTLE PITY. HIS PUNISHMENT FOLLOWED HIS CONDUCT, AS DID A
DEEPER PUNISHMENT THE DEEPER GUILT OF HIS WIFE. HE WAS RELEASED FROM
THE ENGAGEMENT TO BE MORTIFIED AND UNHAPPY, TILL SOME OTHER PRETTY GIRL
COULD ATTRACT HIM INTO MATRIMONY AGAIN, AND HE MIGHT SET FORWARD ON A
SECOND, AND, IT IS TO BE HOPED, MORE PROSPEROUS TRIAL OF THE STATE: IF
DUPED, TO BE DUPED AT LEAST WITH GOOD HUMOUR AND GOOD LUCK; WHILE SHE
MUST WITHDRAW WITH INFINITELY STRONGER FEELINGS TO A RETIREMENT AND
REPROACH WHICH COULD ALLOW NO SECOND SPRING OF HOPE OR CHARACTER.

WHERE SHE COULD BE PLACED BECAME A SUBJECT OF MOST MELANCHOLY AND
MOMENTOUS CONSULTATION. MRS. NORRIS, WHOSE ATTACHMENT SEEMED TO AUGMENT
WITH THE DEMERITS OF HER NIECE, WOULD HAVE HAD HER RECEIVED AT HOME
AND COUNTENANCED BY THEM ALL. SIR THOMAS WOULD NOT HEAR OF IT; AND MRS.
NORRIS'S ANGER AGAINST FANNY WAS SO MUCH THE GREATER, FROM CONSIDERING
HER RESIDENCE THERE AS THE MOTIVE. SHE PERSISTED IN PLACING HIS
SCRUPLES TO HER ACCOUNT, THOUGH SIR THOMAS VERY SOLEMNLY ASSURED HER
THAT, HAD THERE BEEN NO YOUNG WOMAN IN QUESTION, HAD THERE BEEN NO YOUNG
PERSON OF EITHER SEX BELONGING TO HIM, TO BE ENDANGERED BY THE SOCIETY
OR HURT BY THE CHARACTER OF MRS. RUSHWORTH, HE WOULD NEVER HAVE OFFERED
SO GREAT AN INSULT TO THE NEIGHBOURHOOD AS TO EXPECT IT TO NOTICE HER.
AS A DAUGHTER, HE HOPED A PENITENT ONE, SHE SHOULD BE PROTECTED BY HIM,
AND SECURED IN EVERY COMFORT, AND SUPPORTED BY EVERY ENCOURAGEMENT TO DO
RIGHT, WHICH THEIR RELATIVE SITUATIONS ADMITTED; BUT FARTHER THAN THAT
HE COULD NOT GO. MARIA HAD DESTROYED HER OWN CHARACTER, AND HE WOULD
NOT, BY A VAIN ATTEMPT TO RESTORE WHAT NEVER COULD BE RESTORED, BY
AFFORDING HIS SANCTION TO VICE, OR IN SEEKING TO LESSEN ITS DISGRACE, BE
ANYWISE ACCESSORY TO INTRODUCING SUCH MISERY IN ANOTHER MAN'S FAMILY AS
HE HAD KNOWN HIMSELF.

IT ENDED IN MRS. NORRIS'S RESOLVING TO QUIT MANSFIELD AND DEVOTE HERSELF
TO HER UNFORTUNATE MARIA, AND IN AN ESTABLISHMENT BEING FORMED FOR THEM
IN ANOTHER COUNTRY, REMOTE AND PRIVATE, WHERE, SHUT UP TOGETHER WITH
LITTLE SOCIETY, ON ONE SIDE NO AFFECTION, ON THE OTHER NO JUDGMENT,
IT MAY BE REASONABLY SUPPOSED THAT THEIR TEMPERS BECAME THEIR MUTUAL
PUNISHMENT.

MRS. NORRIS'S REMOVAL FROM MANSFIELD WAS THE GREAT SUPPLEMENTARY COMFORT
OF SIR THOMAS'S LIFE. HIS OPINION OF HER HAD BEEN SINKING FROM THE DAY
OF HIS RETURN FROM ANTIGUA: IN EVERY TRANSACTION TOGETHER FROM THAT
PERIOD, IN THEIR DAILY INTERCOURSE, IN BUSINESS, OR IN CHAT, SHE HAD
BEEN REGULARLY LOSING GROUND IN HIS ESTEEM, AND CONVINCING HIM THAT
EITHER TIME HAD DONE HER MUCH DISSERVICE, OR THAT HE HAD CONSIDERABLY
OVER-RATED HER SENSE, AND WONDERFULLY BORNE WITH HER MANNERS BEFORE. HE
HAD FELT HER AS AN HOURLY EVIL, WHICH WAS SO MUCH THE WORSE, AS THERE
SEEMED NO CHANCE OF ITS CEASING BUT WITH LIFE; SHE SEEMED A PART OF
HIMSELF THAT MUST BE BORNE FOR EVER. TO BE RELIEVED FROM HER, THEREFORE,
WAS SO GREAT A FELICITY THAT, HAD SHE NOT LEFT BITTER REMEMBRANCES
BEHIND HER, THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN DANGER OF HIS LEARNING ALMOST TO
APPROVE THE EVIL WHICH PRODUCED SUCH A GOOD.

SHE WAS REGRETTED BY NO ONE AT MANSFIELD. SHE HAD NEVER BEEN ABLE TO
ATTACH EVEN THOSE SHE LOVED BEST; AND SINCE MRS. RUSHWORTH'S ELOPEMENT,
HER TEMPER HAD BEEN IN A STATE OF SUCH IRRITATION AS TO MAKE HER
EVERYWHERE TORMENTING. NOT EVEN FANNY HAD TEARS FOR AUNT NORRIS, NOT
EVEN WHEN SHE WAS GONE FOR EVER.

THAT JULIA ESCAPED BETTER THAN MARIA WAS OWING, IN SOME MEASURE, TO A
FAVOURABLE DIFFERENCE OF DISPOSITION AND CIRCUMSTANCE, BUT IN A GREATER
TO HER HAVING BEEN LESS THE DARLING OF THAT VERY AUNT, LESS FLATTERED
AND LESS SPOILT. HER BEAUTY AND ACQUIREMENTS HAD HELD BUT A SECOND
PLACE. SHE HAD BEEN ALWAYS USED TO THINK HERSELF A LITTLE INFERIOR TO
MARIA. HER TEMPER WAS NATURALLY THE EASIEST OF THE TWO; HER FEELINGS,
THOUGH QUICK, WERE MORE CONTROLLABLE, AND EDUCATION HAD NOT GIVEN HER SO
VERY HURTFUL A DEGREE OF SELF-CONSEQUENCE.

SHE HAD SUBMITTED THE BEST TO THE DISAPPOINTMENT IN HENRY CRAWFORD.
AFTER THE FIRST BITTERNESS OF THE CONVICTION OF BEING SLIGHTED WAS OVER,
SHE HAD BEEN TOLERABLY SOON IN A FAIR WAY OF NOT THINKING OF HIM AGAIN;
AND WHEN THE ACQUAINTANCE WAS RENEWED IN TOWN, AND MR. RUSHWORTH'S HOUSE
BECAME CRAWFORD'S OBJECT, SHE HAD HAD THE MERIT OF WITHDRAWING HERSELF
FROM IT, AND OF CHUSING THAT TIME TO PAY A VISIT TO HER OTHER FRIENDS,
IN ORDER TO SECURE HERSELF FROM BEING AGAIN TOO MUCH ATTRACTED. THIS HAD
BEEN HER MOTIVE IN GOING TO HER COUSIN'S. MR. YATES'S CONVENIENCE HAD
HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. SHE HAD BEEN ALLOWING HIS ATTENTIONS SOME
TIME, BUT WITH VERY LITTLE IDEA OF EVER ACCEPTING HIM; AND HAD NOT HER
SISTER'S CONDUCT BURST FORTH AS IT DID, AND HER INCREASED DREAD OF HER
FATHER AND OF HOME, ON THAT EVENT, IMAGINING ITS CERTAIN CONSEQUENCE
TO HERSELF WOULD BE GREATER SEVERITY AND RESTRAINT, MADE HER HASTILY
RESOLVE ON AVOIDING SUCH IMMEDIATE HORRORS AT ALL RISKS, IT IS PROBABLE
THAT MR. YATES WOULD NEVER HAVE SUCCEEDED. SHE HAD NOT ELOPED WITH ANY
WORSE FEELINGS THAN THOSE OF SELFISH ALARM. IT HAD APPEARED TO HER THE
ONLY THING TO BE DONE. MARIA'S GUILT HAD INDUCED JULIA'S FOLLY.

HENRY CRAWFORD, RUINED BY EARLY INDEPENDENCE AND BAD DOMESTIC EXAMPLE,
INDULGED IN THE FREAKS OF A COLD-BLOODED VANITY A LITTLE TOO LONG. ONCE
IT HAD, BY AN OPENING UNDESIGNED AND UNMERITED, LED HIM INTO THE WAY OF
HAPPINESS. COULD HE HAVE BEEN SATISFIED WITH THE CONQUEST OF ONE
AMIABLE WOMAN'S AFFECTIONS, COULD HE HAVE FOUND SUFFICIENT EXULTATION
IN OVERCOMING THE RELUCTANCE, IN WORKING HIMSELF INTO THE ESTEEM AND
TENDERNESS OF FANNY PRICE, THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN EVERY PROBABILITY OF
SUCCESS AND FELICITY FOR HIM. HIS AFFECTION HAD ALREADY DONE SOMETHING.
HER INFLUENCE OVER HIM HAD ALREADY GIVEN HIM SOME INFLUENCE OVER HER.
WOULD HE HAVE DESERVED MORE, THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT MORE WOULD HAVE
BEEN OBTAINED, ESPECIALLY WHEN THAT MARRIAGE HAD TAKEN PLACE, WHICH
WOULD HAVE GIVEN HIM THE ASSISTANCE OF HER CONSCIENCE IN SUBDUING HER
FIRST INCLINATION, AND BROUGHT THEM VERY OFTEN TOGETHER. WOULD HE HAVE
PERSEVERED, AND UPRIGHTLY, FANNY MUST HAVE BEEN HIS REWARD, AND A REWARD
VERY VOLUNTARILY BESTOWED, WITHIN A REASONABLE PERIOD FROM EDMUND'S
MARRYING MARY.

HAD HE DONE AS HE INTENDED, AND AS HE KNEW HE OUGHT, BY GOING DOWN TO
EVERINGHAM AFTER HIS RETURN FROM PORTSMOUTH, HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN DECIDING
HIS OWN HAPPY DESTINY. BUT HE WAS PRESSED TO STAY FOR MRS. FRASER'S
PARTY; HIS STAYING WAS MADE OF FLATTERING CONSEQUENCE, AND HE WAS TO
MEET MRS. RUSHWORTH THERE. CURIOSITY AND VANITY WERE BOTH ENGAGED, AND
THE TEMPTATION OF IMMEDIATE PLEASURE WAS TOO STRONG FOR A MIND UNUSED TO
MAKE ANY SACRIFICE TO RIGHT: HE RESOLVED TO DEFER HIS NORFOLK JOURNEY,
RESOLVED THAT WRITING SHOULD ANSWER THE PURPOSE OF IT, OR THAT ITS
PURPOSE WAS UNIMPORTANT, AND STAID. HE SAW MRS. RUSHWORTH, WAS RECEIVED
BY HER WITH A COLDNESS WHICH OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN REPULSIVE, AND HAVE
ESTABLISHED APPARENT INDIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM FOR EVER; BUT HE WAS
MORTIFIED, HE COULD NOT BEAR TO BE THROWN OFF BY THE WOMAN WHOSE SMILES
HAD BEEN SO WHOLLY AT HIS COMMAND: HE MUST EXERT HIMSELF TO SUBDUE SO
PROUD A DISPLAY OF RESENTMENT; IT WAS ANGER ON FANNY'S ACCOUNT; HE MUST
GET THE BETTER OF IT, AND MAKE MRS. RUSHWORTH MARIA BERTRAM AGAIN IN HER
TREATMENT OF HIMSELF.

IN THIS SPIRIT HE BEGAN THE ATTACK, AND BY ANIMATED PERSEVERANCE HAD
SOON RE-ESTABLISHED THE SORT OF FAMILIAR INTERCOURSE, OF GALLANTRY,
OF FLIRTATION, WHICH BOUNDED HIS VIEWS; BUT IN TRIUMPHING OVER THE
DISCRETION WHICH, THOUGH BEGINNING IN ANGER, MIGHT HAVE SAVED THEM BOTH,
HE HAD PUT HIMSELF IN THE POWER OF FEELINGS ON HER SIDE MORE STRONG
THAN HE HAD SUPPOSED. SHE LOVED HIM; THERE WAS NO WITHDRAWING ATTENTIONS
AVOWEDLY DEAR TO HER. HE WAS ENTANGLED BY HIS OWN VANITY, WITH AS LITTLE
EXCUSE OF LOVE AS POSSIBLE, AND WITHOUT THE SMALLEST INCONSTANCY OF MIND
TOWARDS HER COUSIN. TO KEEP FANNY AND THE BERTRAMS FROM A KNOWLEDGE OF
WHAT WAS PASSING BECAME HIS FIRST OBJECT. SECRECY COULD NOT HAVE BEEN
MORE DESIRABLE FOR MRS. RUSHWORTH'S CREDIT THAN HE FELT IT FOR HIS OWN.
WHEN HE RETURNED FROM RICHMOND, HE WOULD HAVE BEEN GLAD TO SEE MRS.
RUSHWORTH NO MORE. ALL THAT FOLLOWED WAS THE RESULT OF HER IMPRUDENCE;
AND HE WENT OFF WITH HER AT LAST, BECAUSE HE COULD NOT HELP IT,
REGRETTING FANNY EVEN AT THE MOMENT, BUT REGRETTING HER INFINITELY MORE
WHEN ALL THE BUSTLE OF THE INTRIGUE WAS OVER, AND A VERY FEW MONTHS HAD
TAUGHT HIM, BY THE FORCE OF CONTRAST, TO PLACE A YET HIGHER VALUE ON THE
SWEETNESS OF HER TEMPER, THE PURITY OF HER MIND, AND THE EXCELLENCE OF
HER PRINCIPLES.

THAT PUNISHMENT, THE PUBLIC PUNISHMENT OF DISGRACE, SHOULD IN A JUST
MEASURE ATTEND HIS SHARE OF THE OFFENCE IS, WE KNOW, NOT ONE OF THE
BARRIERS WHICH SOCIETY GIVES TO VIRTUE. IN THIS WORLD THE PENALTY IS
LESS EQUAL THAN COULD BE WISHED; BUT WITHOUT PRESUMING TO LOOK FORWARD
TO A JUSTER APPOINTMENT HEREAFTER, WE MAY FAIRLY CONSIDER A MAN OF
SENSE, LIKE HENRY CRAWFORD, TO BE PROVIDING FOR HIMSELF NO SMALL
PORTION OF VEXATION AND REGRET: VEXATION THAT MUST RISE SOMETIMES
TO SELF-REPROACH, AND REGRET TO WRETCHEDNESS, IN HAVING SO REQUITED
HOSPITALITY, SO INJURED FAMILY PEACE, SO FORFEITED HIS BEST, MOST
ESTIMABLE, AND ENDEARED ACQUAINTANCE, AND SO LOST THE WOMAN WHOM HE HAD
RATIONALLY AS WELL AS PASSIONATELY LOVED.

AFTER WHAT HAD PASSED TO WOUND AND ALIENATE THE TWO FAMILIES, THE
CONTINUANCE OF THE BERTRAMS AND GRANTS IN SUCH CLOSE NEIGHBOURHOOD WOULD
HAVE BEEN MOST DISTRESSING; BUT THE ABSENCE OF THE LATTER, FOR SOME
MONTHS PURPOSELY LENGTHENED, ENDED VERY FORTUNATELY IN THE NECESSITY, OR
AT LEAST THE PRACTICABILITY, OF A PERMANENT REMOVAL. DR. GRANT, THROUGH
AN INTEREST ON WHICH HE HAD ALMOST CEASED TO FORM HOPES, SUCCEEDED TO
A STALL IN WESTMINSTER, WHICH, AS AFFORDING AN OCCASION FOR LEAVING
MANSFIELD, AN EXCUSE FOR RESIDENCE IN LONDON, AND AN INCREASE OF INCOME
TO ANSWER THE EXPENSES OF THE CHANGE, WAS HIGHLY ACCEPTABLE TO THOSE WHO
WENT AND THOSE WHO STAID.

MRS. GRANT, WITH A TEMPER TO LOVE AND BE LOVED, MUST HAVE GONE WITH SOME
REGRET FROM THE SCENES AND PEOPLE SHE HAD BEEN USED TO; BUT THE SAME
HAPPINESS OF DISPOSITION MUST IN ANY PLACE, AND ANY SOCIETY, SECURE HER
A GREAT DEAL TO ENJOY, AND SHE HAD AGAIN A HOME TO OFFER MARY; AND MARY
HAD HAD ENOUGH OF HER OWN FRIENDS, ENOUGH OF VANITY, AMBITION, LOVE, AND
DISAPPOINTMENT IN THE COURSE OF THE LAST HALF-YEAR, TO BE IN NEED OF THE
TRUE KINDNESS OF HER SISTER'S HEART, AND THE RATIONAL TRANQUILLITY
OF HER WAYS. THEY LIVED TOGETHER; AND WHEN DR. GRANT HAD BROUGHT ON
APOPLEXY AND DEATH, BY THREE GREAT INSTITUTIONARY DINNERS IN ONE WEEK,
THEY STILL LIVED TOGETHER; FOR MARY, THOUGH PERFECTLY RESOLVED AGAINST
EVER ATTACHING HERSELF TO A YOUNGER BROTHER AGAIN, WAS LONG IN FINDING
AMONG THE DASHING REPRESENTATIVES, OR IDLE HEIR-APPARENTS, WHO WERE AT
THE COMMAND OF HER BEAUTY, AND HER 20,000, ANY ONE WHO COULD SATISFY THE
BETTER TASTE SHE HAD ACQUIRED AT MANSFIELD, WHOSE CHARACTER AND MANNERS
COULD AUTHORISE A HOPE OF THE DOMESTIC HAPPINESS SHE HAD THERE LEARNED
TO ESTIMATE, OR PUT EDMUND BERTRAM SUFFICIENTLY OUT OF HER HEAD.

EDMUND HAD GREATLY THE ADVANTAGE OF HER IN THIS RESPECT. HE HAD NOT TO
WAIT AND WISH WITH VACANT AFFECTIONS FOR AN OBJECT WORTHY TO SUCCEED HER
IN THEM. SCARCELY HAD HE DONE REGRETTING MARY CRAWFORD, AND OBSERVING TO
FANNY HOW IMPOSSIBLE IT WAS THAT HE SHOULD EVER MEET WITH SUCH ANOTHER
WOMAN, BEFORE IT BEGAN TO STRIKE HIM WHETHER A VERY DIFFERENT KIND OF
WOMAN MIGHT NOT DO JUST AS WELL, OR A GREAT DEAL BETTER: WHETHER FANNY
HERSELF WERE NOT GROWING AS DEAR, AS IMPORTANT TO HIM IN ALL HER SMILES
AND ALL HER WAYS, AS MARY CRAWFORD HAD EVER BEEN; AND WHETHER IT MIGHT
NOT BE A POSSIBLE, AN HOPEFUL UNDERTAKING TO PERSUADE HER THAT HER WARM
AND SISTERLY REGARD FOR HIM WOULD BE FOUNDATION ENOUGH FOR WEDDED LOVE.

I PURPOSELY ABSTAIN FROM DATES ON THIS OCCASION, THAT EVERY ONE MAY
BE AT LIBERTY TO FIX THEIR OWN, AWARE THAT THE CURE OF UNCONQUERABLE
PASSIONS, AND THE TRANSFER OF UNCHANGING ATTACHMENTS, MUST VARY MUCH AS
TO TIME IN DIFFERENT PEOPLE. I ONLY ENTREAT EVERYBODY TO BELIEVE THAT
EXACTLY AT THE TIME WHEN IT WAS QUITE NATURAL THAT IT SHOULD BE SO, AND
NOT A WEEK EARLIER, EDMUND DID CEASE TO CARE ABOUT MISS CRAWFORD, AND
BECAME AS ANXIOUS TO MARRY FANNY AS FANNY HERSELF COULD DESIRE.

WITH SUCH A REGARD FOR HER, INDEED, AS HIS HAD LONG BEEN, A REGARD
FOUNDED ON THE MOST ENDEARING CLAIMS OF INNOCENCE AND HELPLESSNESS, AND
COMPLETED BY EVERY RECOMMENDATION OF GROWING WORTH, WHAT COULD BE MORE
NATURAL THAN THE CHANGE? LOVING, GUIDING, PROTECTING HER, AS HE HAD BEEN
DOING EVER SINCE HER BEING TEN YEARS OLD, HER MIND IN SO GREAT A DEGREE
FORMED BY HIS CARE, AND HER COMFORT DEPENDING ON HIS KINDNESS, AN
OBJECT TO HIM OF SUCH CLOSE AND PECULIAR INTEREST, DEARER BY ALL HIS OWN
IMPORTANCE WITH HER THAN ANY ONE ELSE AT MANSFIELD, WHAT WAS THERE NOW
TO ADD, BUT THAT HE SHOULD LEARN TO PREFER SOFT LIGHT EYES TO SPARKLING
DARK ONES. AND BEING ALWAYS WITH HER, AND ALWAYS TALKING CONFIDENTIALLY,
AND HIS FEELINGS EXACTLY IN THAT FAVOURABLE STATE WHICH A RECENT
DISAPPOINTMENT GIVES, THOSE SOFT LIGHT EYES COULD NOT BE VERY LONG IN
OBTAINING THE PRE-EMINENCE.

HAVING ONCE SET OUT, AND FELT THAT HE HAD DONE SO ON THIS ROAD TO
HAPPINESS, THERE WAS NOTHING ON THE SIDE OF PRUDENCE TO STOP HIM OR MAKE
HIS PROGRESS SLOW; NO DOUBTS OF HER DESERVING, NO FEARS OF OPPOSITION OF
TASTE, NO NEED OF DRAWING NEW HOPES OF HAPPINESS FROM DISSIMILARITY
OF TEMPER. HER MIND, DISPOSITION, OPINIONS, AND HABITS WANTED NO
HALF-CONCEALMENT, NO SELF-DECEPTION ON THE PRESENT, NO RELIANCE ON
FUTURE IMPROVEMENT. EVEN IN THE MIDST OF HIS LATE INFATUATION, HE HAD
ACKNOWLEDGED FANNY'S MENTAL SUPERIORITY. WHAT MUST BE HIS SENSE OF IT
NOW, THEREFORE? SHE WAS OF COURSE ONLY TOO GOOD FOR HIM; BUT AS NOBODY
MINDS HAVING WHAT IS TOO GOOD FOR THEM, HE WAS VERY STEADILY EARNEST IN
THE PURSUIT OF THE BLESSING, AND IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE THAT ENCOURAGEMENT
FROM HER SHOULD BE LONG WANTING. TIMID, ANXIOUS, DOUBTING AS SHE WAS, IT
WAS STILL IMPOSSIBLE THAT SUCH TENDERNESS AS HERS SHOULD NOT, AT TIMES,
HOLD OUT THE STRONGEST HOPE OF SUCCESS, THOUGH IT REMAINED FOR A LATER
PERIOD TO TELL HIM THE WHOLE DELIGHTFUL AND ASTONISHING TRUTH. HIS
HAPPINESS IN KNOWING HIMSELF TO HAVE BEEN SO LONG THE BELOVED OF SUCH A
HEART, MUST HAVE BEEN GREAT ENOUGH TO WARRANT ANY STRENGTH OF LANGUAGE
IN WHICH HE COULD CLOTHE IT TO HER OR TO HIMSELF; IT MUST HAVE BEEN
A DELIGHTFUL HAPPINESS. BUT THERE WAS HAPPINESS ELSEWHERE WHICH NO
DESCRIPTION CAN REACH. LET NO ONE PRESUME TO GIVE THE FEELINGS OF A
YOUNG WOMAN ON RECEIVING THE ASSURANCE OF THAT AFFECTION OF WHICH SHE
HAS SCARCELY ALLOWED HERSELF TO ENTERTAIN A HOPE.

THEIR OWN INCLINATIONS ASCERTAINED, THERE WERE NO DIFFICULTIES BEHIND,
NO DRAWBACK OF POVERTY OR PARENT. IT WAS A MATCH WHICH SIR THOMAS'S
WISHES HAD EVEN FORESTALLED. SICK OF AMBITIOUS AND MERCENARY CONNEXIONS,
PRIZING MORE AND MORE THE STERLING GOOD OF PRINCIPLE AND TEMPER, AND
CHIEFLY ANXIOUS TO BIND BY THE STRONGEST SECURITIES ALL THAT REMAINED TO
HIM OF DOMESTIC FELICITY, HE HAD PONDERED WITH GENUINE SATISFACTION ON
THE MORE THAN POSSIBILITY OF THE TWO YOUNG FRIENDS FINDING THEIR NATURAL
CONSOLATION IN EACH OTHER FOR ALL THAT HAD OCCURRED OF DISAPPOINTMENT TO
EITHER; AND THE JOYFUL CONSENT WHICH MET EDMUND'S APPLICATION, THE HIGH
SENSE OF HAVING REALISED A GREAT ACQUISITION IN THE PROMISE OF FANNY FOR
A DAUGHTER, FORMED JUST SUCH A CONTRAST WITH HIS EARLY OPINION ON THE
SUBJECT WHEN THE POOR LITTLE GIRL'S COMING HAD BEEN FIRST AGITATED, AS
TIME IS FOR EVER PRODUCING BETWEEN THE PLANS AND DECISIONS OF MORTALS,
FOR THEIR OWN INSTRUCTION, AND THEIR NEIGHBOURS' ENTERTAINMENT.

FANNY WAS INDEED THE DAUGHTER THAT HE WANTED. HIS CHARITABLE KINDNESS
HAD BEEN REARING A PRIME COMFORT FOR HIMSELF. HIS LIBERALITY HAD A RICH
REPAYMENT, AND THE GENERAL GOODNESS OF HIS INTENTIONS BY HER DESERVED
IT. HE MIGHT HAVE MADE HER CHILDHOOD HAPPIER; BUT IT HAD BEEN AN ERROR
OF JUDGMENT ONLY WHICH HAD GIVEN HIM THE APPEARANCE OF HARSHNESS, AND
DEPRIVED HIM OF HER EARLY LOVE; AND NOW, ON REALLY KNOWING EACH OTHER,
THEIR MUTUAL ATTACHMENT BECAME VERY STRONG. AFTER SETTLING HER AT
THORNTON LACEY WITH EVERY KIND ATTENTION TO HER COMFORT, THE OBJECT OF
ALMOST EVERY DAY WAS TO SEE HER THERE, OR TO GET HER AWAY FROM IT.

SELFISHLY DEAR AS SHE HAD LONG BEEN TO LADY BERTRAM, SHE COULD NOT BE
PARTED WITH WILLINGLY BY HER. NO HAPPINESS OF SON OR NIECE COULD MAKE
HER WISH THE MARRIAGE. BUT IT WAS POSSIBLE TO PART WITH HER, BECAUSE
SUSAN REMAINED TO SUPPLY HER PLACE. SUSAN BECAME THE STATIONARY NIECE,
DELIGHTED TO BE SO; AND EQUALLY WELL ADAPTED FOR IT BY A READINESS OF
MIND, AND AN INCLINATION FOR USEFULNESS, AS FANNY HAD BEEN BY SWEETNESS
OF TEMPER, AND STRONG FEELINGS OF GRATITUDE. SUSAN COULD NEVER BE
SPARED. FIRST AS A COMFORT TO FANNY, THEN AS AN AUXILIARY, AND LAST AS
HER SUBSTITUTE, SHE WAS ESTABLISHED AT MANSFIELD, WITH EVERY APPEARANCE
OF EQUAL PERMANENCY. HER MORE FEARLESS DISPOSITION AND HAPPIER NERVES
MADE EVERYTHING EASY TO HER THERE. WITH QUICKNESS IN UNDERSTANDING
THE TEMPERS OF THOSE SHE HAD TO DEAL WITH, AND NO NATURAL TIMIDITY TO
RESTRAIN ANY CONSEQUENT WISHES, SHE WAS SOON WELCOME AND USEFUL TO ALL;
AND AFTER FANNY'S REMOVAL SUCCEEDED SO NATURALLY TO HER INFLUENCE OVER
THE HOURLY COMFORT OF HER AUNT, AS GRADUALLY TO BECOME, PERHAPS, THE
MOST BELOVED OF THE TWO. IN HER USEFULNESS, IN FANNY'S EXCELLENCE,
IN WILLIAM'S CONTINUED GOOD CONDUCT AND RISING FAME, AND IN THE GENERAL
WELL-DOING AND SUCCESS OF THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY, ALL ASSISTING
TO ADVANCE EACH OTHER, AND DOING CREDIT TO HIS COUNTENANCE AND AID, SIR
THOMAS SAW REPEATED, AND FOR EVER REPEATED, REASON TO REJOICE IN WHAT HE
HAD DONE FOR THEM ALL, AND ACKNOWLEDGE THE ADVANTAGES OF EARLY HARDSHIP
AND DISCIPLINE, AND THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF BEING BORN TO STRUGGLE AND
ENDURE.

WITH SO MUCH TRUE MERIT AND TRUE LOVE, AND NO WANT OF FORTUNE AND
FRIENDS, THE HAPPINESS OF THE MARRIED COUSINS MUST APPEAR AS SECURE AS
EARTHLY HAPPINESS CAN BE. EQUALLY FORMED FOR DOMESTIC LIFE, AND ATTACHED
TO COUNTRY PLEASURES, THEIR HOME WAS THE HOME OF AFFECTION AND COMFORT;
AND TO COMPLETE THE PICTURE OF GOOD, THE ACQUISITION OF MANSFIELD
LIVING, BY THE DEATH OF DR. GRANT, OCCURRED JUST AFTER THEY HAD BEEN
MARRIED LONG ENOUGH TO BEGIN TO WANT AN INCREASE OF INCOME, AND FEEL
THEIR DISTANCE FROM THE PATERNAL ABODE AN INCONVENIENCE.

ON THAT EVENT THEY REMOVED TO MANSFIELD; AND THE PARSONAGE THERE,
WHICH, UNDER EACH OF ITS TWO FORMER OWNERS, FANNY HAD NEVER BEEN ABLE
TO APPROACH BUT WITH SOME PAINFUL SENSATION OF RESTRAINT OR ALARM, SOON
GREW AS DEAR TO HER HEART, AND AS THOROUGHLY PERFECT IN HER EYES, AS
EVERYTHING ELSE WITHIN THE VIEW AND PATRONAGE OF MANSFIELD PARK HAD LONG
BEEN.


THE END








EMMA

BY JANE AUSTEN




VOLUME I



CHAPTER I


EMMA WOODHOUSE, HANDSOME, CLEVER, AND RICH, WITH A COMFORTABLE HOME
AND HAPPY DISPOSITION, SEEMED TO UNITE SOME OF THE BEST BLESSINGS OF
EXISTENCE; AND HAD LIVED NEARLY TWENTY-ONE YEARS IN THE WORLD WITH VERY
LITTLE TO DISTRESS OR VEX HER.

SHE WAS THE YOUNGEST OF THE TWO DAUGHTERS OF A MOST AFFECTIONATE,
INDULGENT FATHER; AND HAD, IN CONSEQUENCE OF HER SISTER'S MARRIAGE, BEEN
MISTRESS OF HIS HOUSE FROM A VERY EARLY PERIOD. HER MOTHER HAD DIED
TOO LONG AGO FOR HER TO HAVE MORE THAN AN INDISTINCT REMEMBRANCE OF
HER CARESSES; AND HER PLACE HAD BEEN SUPPLIED BY AN EXCELLENT WOMAN AS
GOVERNESS, WHO HAD FALLEN LITTLE SHORT OF A MOTHER IN AFFECTION.

SIXTEEN YEARS HAD MISS TAYLOR BEEN IN MR. WOODHOUSE'S FAMILY, LESS AS A
GOVERNESS THAN A FRIEND, VERY FOND OF BOTH DAUGHTERS, BUT PARTICULARLY
OF EMMA. BETWEEN THEM IT WAS MORE THE INTIMACY OF SISTERS. EVEN BEFORE
MISS TAYLOR HAD CEASED TO HOLD THE NOMINAL OFFICE OF GOVERNESS, THE
MILDNESS OF HER TEMPER HAD HARDLY ALLOWED HER TO IMPOSE ANY RESTRAINT;
AND THE SHADOW OF AUTHORITY BEING NOW LONG PASSED AWAY, THEY HAD BEEN
LIVING TOGETHER AS FRIEND AND FRIEND VERY MUTUALLY ATTACHED, AND EMMA
DOING JUST WHAT SHE LIKED; HIGHLY ESTEEMING MISS TAYLOR'S JUDGMENT, BUT
DIRECTED CHIEFLY BY HER OWN.

THE REAL EVILS, INDEED, OF EMMA'S SITUATION WERE THE POWER OF HAVING
RATHER TOO MUCH HER OWN WAY, AND A DISPOSITION TO THINK A LITTLE TOO
WELL OF HERSELF; THESE WERE THE DISADVANTAGES WHICH THREATENED ALLOY TO
HER MANY ENJOYMENTS. THE DANGER, HOWEVER, WAS AT PRESENT SO UNPERCEIVED,
THAT THEY DID NOT BY ANY MEANS RANK AS MISFORTUNES WITH HER.

SORROW CAME--A GENTLE SORROW--BUT NOT AT ALL IN THE SHAPE OF ANY
DISAGREEABLE CONSCIOUSNESS.--MISS TAYLOR MARRIED. IT WAS MISS TAYLOR'S
LOSS WHICH FIRST BROUGHT GRIEF. IT WAS ON THE WEDDING-DAY OF THIS
BELOVED FRIEND THAT EMMA FIRST SAT IN MOURNFUL THOUGHT OF ANY
CONTINUANCE. THE WEDDING OVER, AND THE BRIDE-PEOPLE GONE, HER FATHER AND
HERSELF WERE LEFT TO DINE TOGETHER, WITH NO PROSPECT OF A THIRD TO CHEER
A LONG EVENING. HER FATHER COMPOSED HIMSELF TO SLEEP AFTER DINNER, AS
USUAL, AND SHE HAD THEN ONLY TO SIT AND THINK OF WHAT SHE HAD LOST.

THE EVENT HAD EVERY PROMISE OF HAPPINESS FOR HER FRIEND. MR. WESTON
WAS A MAN OF UNEXCEPTIONABLE CHARACTER, EASY FORTUNE, SUITABLE AGE, AND
PLEASANT MANNERS; AND THERE WAS SOME SATISFACTION IN CONSIDERING
WITH WHAT SELF-DENYING, GENEROUS FRIENDSHIP SHE HAD ALWAYS WISHED AND
PROMOTED THE MATCH; BUT IT WAS A BLACK MORNING'S WORK FOR HER. THE WANT
OF MISS TAYLOR WOULD BE FELT EVERY HOUR OF EVERY DAY. SHE RECALLED HER
PAST KINDNESS--THE KINDNESS, THE AFFECTION OF SIXTEEN YEARS--HOW SHE HAD
TAUGHT AND HOW SHE HAD PLAYED WITH HER FROM FIVE YEARS OLD--HOW SHE HAD
DEVOTED ALL HER POWERS TO ATTACH AND AMUSE HER IN HEALTH--AND HOW
NURSED HER THROUGH THE VARIOUS ILLNESSES OF CHILDHOOD. A LARGE DEBT OF
GRATITUDE WAS OWING HERE; BUT THE INTERCOURSE OF THE LAST SEVEN
YEARS, THE EQUAL FOOTING AND PERFECT UNRESERVE WHICH HAD SOON FOLLOWED
ISABELLA'S MARRIAGE, ON THEIR BEING LEFT TO EACH OTHER, WAS YET A
DEARER, TENDERER RECOLLECTION. SHE HAD BEEN A FRIEND AND COMPANION SUCH
AS FEW POSSESSED: INTELLIGENT, WELL-INFORMED, USEFUL, GENTLE, KNOWING
ALL THE WAYS OF THE FAMILY, INTERESTED IN ALL ITS CONCERNS, AND
PECULIARLY INTERESTED IN HERSELF, IN EVERY PLEASURE, EVERY SCHEME OF
HERS--ONE TO WHOM SHE COULD SPEAK EVERY THOUGHT AS IT AROSE, AND WHO HAD
SUCH AN AFFECTION FOR HER AS COULD NEVER FIND FAULT.

HOW WAS SHE TO BEAR THE CHANGE?--IT WAS TRUE THAT HER FRIEND WAS GOING
ONLY HALF A MILE FROM THEM; BUT EMMA WAS AWARE THAT GREAT MUST BE THE
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A MRS. WESTON, ONLY HALF A MILE FROM THEM, AND A MISS
TAYLOR IN THE HOUSE; AND WITH ALL HER ADVANTAGES, NATURAL AND DOMESTIC,
SHE WAS NOW IN GREAT DANGER OF SUFFERING FROM INTELLECTUAL SOLITUDE. SHE
DEARLY LOVED HER FATHER, BUT HE WAS NO COMPANION FOR HER. HE COULD NOT
MEET HER IN CONVERSATION, RATIONAL OR PLAYFUL.

THE EVIL OF THE ACTUAL DISPARITY IN THEIR AGES (AND MR. WOODHOUSE HAD
NOT MARRIED EARLY) WAS MUCH INCREASED BY HIS CONSTITUTION AND HABITS;
FOR HAVING BEEN A VALETUDINARIAN ALL HIS LIFE, WITHOUT ACTIVITY OF
MIND OR BODY, HE WAS A MUCH OLDER MAN IN WAYS THAN IN YEARS; AND THOUGH
EVERYWHERE BELOVED FOR THE FRIENDLINESS OF HIS HEART AND HIS AMIABLE
TEMPER, HIS TALENTS COULD NOT HAVE RECOMMENDED HIM AT ANY TIME.

HER SISTER, THOUGH COMPARATIVELY BUT LITTLE REMOVED BY MATRIMONY, BEING
SETTLED IN LONDON, ONLY SIXTEEN MILES OFF, WAS MUCH BEYOND HER DAILY
REACH; AND MANY A LONG OCTOBER AND NOVEMBER EVENING MUST BE STRUGGLED
THROUGH AT HARTFIELD, BEFORE CHRISTMAS BROUGHT THE NEXT VISIT FROM
ISABELLA AND HER HUSBAND, AND THEIR LITTLE CHILDREN, TO FILL THE HOUSE,
AND GIVE HER PLEASANT SOCIETY AGAIN.

HIGHBURY, THE LARGE AND POPULOUS VILLAGE, ALMOST AMOUNTING TO A TOWN,
TO WHICH HARTFIELD, IN SPITE OF ITS SEPARATE LAWN, AND SHRUBBERIES, AND
NAME, DID REALLY BELONG, AFFORDED HER NO EQUALS. THE WOODHOUSES
WERE FIRST IN CONSEQUENCE THERE. ALL LOOKED UP TO THEM. SHE HAD MANY
ACQUAINTANCE IN THE PLACE, FOR HER FATHER WAS UNIVERSALLY CIVIL, BUT
NOT ONE AMONG THEM WHO COULD BE ACCEPTED IN LIEU OF MISS TAYLOR FOR EVEN
HALF A DAY. IT WAS A MELANCHOLY CHANGE; AND EMMA COULD NOT BUT SIGH OVER
IT, AND WISH FOR IMPOSSIBLE THINGS, TILL HER FATHER AWOKE, AND MADE IT
NECESSARY TO BE CHEERFUL. HIS SPIRITS REQUIRED SUPPORT. HE WAS A NERVOUS
MAN, EASILY DEPRESSED; FOND OF EVERY BODY THAT HE WAS USED TO, AND
HATING TO PART WITH THEM; HATING CHANGE OF EVERY KIND. MATRIMONY, AS THE
ORIGIN OF CHANGE, WAS ALWAYS DISAGREEABLE; AND HE WAS BY NO MEANS YET
RECONCILED TO HIS OWN DAUGHTER'S MARRYING, NOR COULD EVER SPEAK OF HER
BUT WITH COMPASSION, THOUGH IT HAD BEEN ENTIRELY A MATCH OF AFFECTION,
WHEN HE WAS NOW OBLIGED TO PART WITH MISS TAYLOR TOO; AND FROM HIS
HABITS OF GENTLE SELFISHNESS, AND OF BEING NEVER ABLE TO SUPPOSE THAT
OTHER PEOPLE COULD FEEL DIFFERENTLY FROM HIMSELF, HE WAS VERY MUCH
DISPOSED TO THINK MISS TAYLOR HAD DONE AS SAD A THING FOR HERSELF AS FOR
THEM, AND WOULD HAVE BEEN A GREAT DEAL HAPPIER IF SHE HAD SPENT ALL THE
REST OF HER LIFE AT HARTFIELD. EMMA SMILED AND CHATTED AS CHEERFULLY
AS SHE COULD, TO KEEP HIM FROM SUCH THOUGHTS; BUT WHEN TEA CAME, IT WAS
IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM NOT TO SAY EXACTLY AS HE HAD SAID AT DINNER,

"POOR MISS TAYLOR!--I WISH SHE WERE HERE AGAIN. WHAT A PITY IT IS THAT
MR. WESTON EVER THOUGHT OF HER!"

"I CANNOT AGREE WITH YOU, PAPA; YOU KNOW I CANNOT. MR. WESTON IS SUCH
A GOOD-HUMOURED, PLEASANT, EXCELLENT MAN, THAT HE THOROUGHLY DESERVES
A GOOD WIFE;--AND YOU WOULD NOT HAVE HAD MISS TAYLOR LIVE WITH US FOR
EVER, AND BEAR ALL MY ODD HUMOURS, WHEN SHE MIGHT HAVE A HOUSE OF HER
OWN?"

"A HOUSE OF HER OWN!--BUT WHERE IS THE ADVANTAGE OF A HOUSE OF HER OWN?
THIS IS THREE TIMES AS LARGE.--AND YOU HAVE NEVER ANY ODD HUMOURS, MY
DEAR."

"HOW OFTEN WE SHALL BE GOING TO SEE THEM, AND THEY COMING TO SEE US!--WE
SHALL BE ALWAYS MEETING! WE MUST BEGIN; WE MUST GO AND PAY WEDDING
VISIT VERY SOON."

"MY DEAR, HOW AM I TO GET SO FAR? RANDALLS IS SUCH A DISTANCE. I COULD
NOT WALK HALF SO FAR."

"NO, PAPA, NOBODY THOUGHT OF YOUR WALKING. WE MUST GO IN THE CARRIAGE,
TO BE SURE."

"THE CARRIAGE! BUT JAMES WILL NOT LIKE TO PUT THE HORSES TO FOR SUCH A
LITTLE WAY;--AND WHERE ARE THE POOR HORSES TO BE WHILE WE ARE PAYING OUR
VISIT?"

"THEY ARE TO BE PUT INTO MR. WESTON'S STABLE, PAPA. YOU KNOW WE HAVE
SETTLED ALL THAT ALREADY. WE TALKED IT ALL OVER WITH MR. WESTON LAST
NIGHT. AND AS FOR JAMES, YOU MAY BE VERY SURE HE WILL ALWAYS LIKE GOING
TO RANDALLS, BECAUSE OF HIS DAUGHTER'S BEING HOUSEMAID THERE. I ONLY
DOUBT WHETHER HE WILL EVER TAKE US ANYWHERE ELSE. THAT WAS YOUR DOING,
PAPA. YOU GOT HANNAH THAT GOOD PLACE. NOBODY THOUGHT OF HANNAH TILL YOU
MENTIONED HER--JAMES IS SO OBLIGED TO YOU!"

"I AM VERY GLAD I DID THINK OF HER. IT WAS VERY LUCKY, FOR I WOULD NOT
HAVE HAD POOR JAMES THINK HIMSELF SLIGHTED UPON ANY ACCOUNT; AND I AM
SURE SHE WILL MAKE A VERY GOOD SERVANT: SHE IS A CIVIL, PRETTY-SPOKEN
GIRL; I HAVE A GREAT OPINION OF HER. WHENEVER I SEE HER, SHE ALWAYS
CURTSEYS AND ASKS ME HOW I DO, IN A VERY PRETTY MANNER; AND WHEN YOU
HAVE HAD HER HERE TO DO NEEDLEWORK, I OBSERVE SHE ALWAYS TURNS THE LOCK
OF THE DOOR THE RIGHT WAY AND NEVER BANGS IT. I AM SURE SHE WILL BE AN
EXCELLENT SERVANT; AND IT WILL BE A GREAT COMFORT TO POOR MISS TAYLOR
TO HAVE SOMEBODY ABOUT HER THAT SHE IS USED TO SEE. WHENEVER JAMES GOES
OVER TO SEE HIS DAUGHTER, YOU KNOW, SHE WILL BE HEARING OF US. HE WILL
BE ABLE TO TELL HER HOW WE ALL ARE."

EMMA SPARED NO EXERTIONS TO MAINTAIN THIS HAPPIER FLOW OF IDEAS, AND
HOPED, BY THE HELP OF BACKGAMMON, TO GET HER FATHER TOLERABLY
THROUGH THE EVENING, AND BE ATTACKED BY NO REGRETS BUT HER OWN. THE
BACKGAMMON-TABLE WAS PLACED; BUT A VISITOR IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS WALKED
IN AND MADE IT UNNECESSARY.

MR. KNIGHTLEY, A SENSIBLE MAN ABOUT SEVEN OR EIGHT-AND-THIRTY, WAS NOT
ONLY A VERY OLD AND INTIMATE FRIEND OF THE FAMILY, BUT PARTICULARLY
CONNECTED WITH IT, AS THE ELDER BROTHER OF ISABELLA'S HUSBAND. HE LIVED
ABOUT A MILE FROM HIGHBURY, WAS A FREQUENT VISITOR, AND ALWAYS WELCOME,
AND AT THIS TIME MORE WELCOME THAN USUAL, AS COMING DIRECTLY FROM THEIR
MUTUAL CONNEXIONS IN LONDON. HE HAD RETURNED TO A LATE DINNER, AFTER
SOME DAYS' ABSENCE, AND NOW WALKED UP TO HARTFIELD TO SAY THAT ALL WERE
WELL IN BRUNSWICK SQUARE. IT WAS A HAPPY CIRCUMSTANCE, AND ANIMATED
MR. WOODHOUSE FOR SOME TIME. MR. KNIGHTLEY HAD A CHEERFUL MANNER, WHICH
ALWAYS DID HIM GOOD; AND HIS MANY INQUIRIES AFTER "POOR ISABELLA" AND
HER CHILDREN WERE ANSWERED MOST SATISFACTORILY. WHEN THIS WAS OVER, MR.
WOODHOUSE GRATEFULLY OBSERVED, "IT IS VERY KIND OF YOU, MR. KNIGHTLEY,
TO COME OUT AT THIS LATE HOUR TO CALL UPON US. I AM AFRAID YOU MUST HAVE
HAD A SHOCKING WALK."

"NOT AT ALL, SIR. IT IS A BEAUTIFUL MOONLIGHT NIGHT; AND SO MILD THAT I
MUST DRAW BACK FROM YOUR GREAT FIRE."

"BUT YOU MUST HAVE FOUND IT VERY DAMP AND DIRTY. I WISH YOU MAY NOT
CATCH COLD."

"DIRTY, SIR! LOOK AT MY SHOES. NOT A SPECK ON THEM."

"WELL! THAT IS QUITE SURPRISING, FOR WE HAVE HAD A VAST DEAL OF RAIN
HERE. IT RAINED DREADFULLY HARD FOR HALF AN HOUR WHILE WE WERE AT
BREAKFAST. I WANTED THEM TO PUT OFF THE WEDDING."

"BY THE BYE--I HAVE NOT WISHED YOU JOY. BEING PRETTY WELL AWARE OF WHAT
SORT OF JOY YOU MUST BOTH BE FEELING, I HAVE BEEN IN NO HURRY WITH MY
CONGRATULATIONS; BUT I HOPE IT ALL WENT OFF TOLERABLY WELL. HOW DID YOU
ALL BEHAVE? WHO CRIED MOST?"

"AH! POOR MISS TAYLOR! 'TIS A SAD BUSINESS."

"POOR MR. AND MISS WOODHOUSE, IF YOU PLEASE; BUT I CANNOT POSSIBLY SAY
'POOR MISS TAYLOR.' I HAVE A GREAT REGARD FOR YOU AND EMMA; BUT WHEN IT
COMES TO THE QUESTION OF DEPENDENCE OR INDEPENDENCE!--AT ANY RATE, IT
MUST BE BETTER TO HAVE ONLY ONE TO PLEASE THAN TWO."

"ESPECIALLY WHEN ONE OF THOSE TWO IS SUCH A FANCIFUL, TROUBLESOME
CREATURE!" SAID EMMA PLAYFULLY. "THAT IS WHAT YOU HAVE IN YOUR HEAD, I
KNOW--AND WHAT YOU WOULD CERTAINLY SAY IF MY FATHER WERE NOT BY."

"I BELIEVE IT IS VERY TRUE, MY DEAR, INDEED," SAID MR. WOODHOUSE, WITH A
SIGH. "I AM AFRAID I AM SOMETIMES VERY FANCIFUL AND TROUBLESOME."

"MY DEAREST PAPA! YOU DO NOT THINK I COULD MEAN YOU, OR SUPPOSE MR.
KNIGHTLEY TO MEAN YOU. WHAT A HORRIBLE IDEA! OH NO! I MEANT ONLY
MYSELF. MR. KNIGHTLEY LOVES TO FIND FAULT WITH ME, YOU KNOW--IN A
JOKE--IT IS ALL A JOKE. WE ALWAYS SAY WHAT WE LIKE TO ONE ANOTHER."

MR. KNIGHTLEY, IN FACT, WAS ONE OF THE FEW PEOPLE WHO COULD SEE FAULTS
IN EMMA WOODHOUSE, AND THE ONLY ONE WHO EVER TOLD HER OF THEM: AND
THOUGH THIS WAS NOT PARTICULARLY AGREEABLE TO EMMA HERSELF, SHE KNEW
IT WOULD BE SO MUCH LESS SO TO HER FATHER, THAT SHE WOULD NOT HAVE HIM
REALLY SUSPECT SUCH A CIRCUMSTANCE AS HER NOT BEING THOUGHT PERFECT BY
EVERY BODY.

"EMMA KNOWS I NEVER FLATTER HER," SAID MR. KNIGHTLEY, "BUT I MEANT NO
REFLECTION ON ANY BODY. MISS TAYLOR HAS BEEN USED TO HAVE TWO PERSONS
TO PLEASE; SHE WILL NOW HAVE BUT ONE. THE CHANCES ARE THAT SHE MUST BE A
GAINER."

"WELL," SAID EMMA, WILLING TO LET IT PASS--"YOU WANT TO HEAR ABOUT
THE WEDDING; AND I SHALL BE HAPPY TO TELL YOU, FOR WE ALL BEHAVED
CHARMINGLY. EVERY BODY WAS PUNCTUAL, EVERY BODY IN THEIR BEST LOOKS: NOT
A TEAR, AND HARDLY A LONG FACE TO BE SEEN. OH NO; WE ALL FELT THAT WE
WERE GOING TO BE ONLY HALF A MILE APART, AND WERE SURE OF MEETING EVERY
DAY."

"DEAR EMMA BEARS EVERY THING SO WELL," SAID HER FATHER. "BUT, MR.
KNIGHTLEY, SHE IS REALLY VERY SORRY TO LOSE POOR MISS TAYLOR, AND I AM
SURE SHE WILL MISS HER MORE THAN SHE THINKS FOR."

EMMA TURNED AWAY HER HEAD, DIVIDED BETWEEN TEARS AND SMILES. "IT
IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT EMMA SHOULD NOT MISS SUCH A COMPANION," SAID MR.
KNIGHTLEY. "WE SHOULD NOT LIKE HER SO WELL AS WE DO, SIR, IF WE COULD
SUPPOSE IT; BUT SHE KNOWS HOW MUCH THE MARRIAGE IS TO MISS TAYLOR'S
ADVANTAGE; SHE KNOWS HOW VERY ACCEPTABLE IT MUST BE, AT MISS TAYLOR'S
TIME OF LIFE, TO BE SETTLED IN A HOME OF HER OWN, AND HOW IMPORTANT TO
HER TO BE SECURE OF A COMFORTABLE PROVISION, AND THEREFORE CANNOT ALLOW
HERSELF TO FEEL SO MUCH PAIN AS PLEASURE. EVERY FRIEND OF MISS TAYLOR
MUST BE GLAD TO HAVE HER SO HAPPILY MARRIED."

"AND YOU HAVE FORGOTTEN ONE MATTER OF JOY TO ME," SAID EMMA, "AND A VERY
CONSIDERABLE ONE--THAT I MADE THE MATCH MYSELF. I MADE THE MATCH, YOU
KNOW, FOUR YEARS AGO; AND TO HAVE IT TAKE PLACE, AND BE PROVED IN THE
RIGHT, WHEN SO MANY PEOPLE SAID MR. WESTON WOULD NEVER MARRY AGAIN, MAY
COMFORT ME FOR ANY THING."

MR. KNIGHTLEY SHOOK HIS HEAD AT HER. HER FATHER FONDLY REPLIED, "AH!
MY DEAR, I WISH YOU WOULD NOT MAKE MATCHES AND FORETELL THINGS, FOR
WHATEVER YOU SAY ALWAYS COMES TO PASS. PRAY DO NOT MAKE ANY MORE
MATCHES."

"I PROMISE YOU TO MAKE NONE FOR MYSELF, PAPA; BUT I MUST, INDEED, FOR
OTHER PEOPLE. IT IS THE GREATEST AMUSEMENT IN THE WORLD! AND AFTER SUCH
SUCCESS, YOU KNOW!--EVERY BODY SAID THAT MR. WESTON WOULD NEVER MARRY
AGAIN. OH DEAR, NO! MR. WESTON, WHO HAD BEEN A WIDOWER SO LONG, AND WHO
SEEMED SO PERFECTLY COMFORTABLE WITHOUT A WIFE, SO CONSTANTLY OCCUPIED
EITHER IN HIS BUSINESS IN TOWN OR AMONG HIS FRIENDS HERE, ALWAYS
ACCEPTABLE WHEREVER HE WENT, ALWAYS CHEERFUL--MR. WESTON NEED NOT SPEND
A SINGLE EVENING IN THE YEAR ALONE IF HE DID NOT LIKE IT. OH NO! MR.
WESTON CERTAINLY WOULD NEVER MARRY AGAIN. SOME PEOPLE EVEN TALKED OF A
PROMISE TO HIS WIFE ON HER DEATHBED, AND OTHERS OF THE SON AND THE
UNCLE NOT LETTING HIM. ALL MANNER OF SOLEMN NONSENSE WAS TALKED ON THE
SUBJECT, BUT I BELIEVED NONE OF IT.

"EVER SINCE THE DAY--ABOUT FOUR YEARS AGO--THAT MISS TAYLOR AND I MET
WITH HIM IN BROADWAY LANE, WHEN, BECAUSE IT BEGAN TO DRIZZLE, HE DARTED
AWAY WITH SO MUCH GALLANTRY, AND BORROWED TWO UMBRELLAS FOR US FROM
FARMER MITCHELL'S, I MADE UP MY MIND ON THE SUBJECT. I PLANNED THE MATCH
FROM THAT HOUR; AND WHEN SUCH SUCCESS HAS BLESSED ME IN THIS INSTANCE,
DEAR PAPA, YOU CANNOT THINK THAT I SHALL LEAVE OFF MATCH-MAKING."

"I DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU MEAN BY 'SUCCESS,'" SAID MR. KNIGHTLEY.
"SUCCESS SUPPOSES ENDEAVOUR. YOUR TIME HAS BEEN PROPERLY AND DELICATELY
SPENT, IF YOU HAVE BEEN ENDEAVOURING FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS TO BRING
ABOUT THIS MARRIAGE. A WORTHY EMPLOYMENT FOR A YOUNG LADY'S MIND! BUT
IF, WHICH I RATHER IMAGINE, YOUR MAKING THE MATCH, AS YOU CALL IT, MEANS
ONLY YOUR PLANNING IT, YOUR SAYING TO YOURSELF ONE IDLE DAY, 'I THINK IT
WOULD BE A VERY GOOD THING FOR MISS TAYLOR IF MR. WESTON WERE TO MARRY
HER,' AND SAYING IT AGAIN TO YOURSELF EVERY NOW AND THEN AFTERWARDS, WHY
DO YOU TALK OF SUCCESS? WHERE IS YOUR MERIT? WHAT ARE YOU PROUD OF? YOU
MADE A LUCKY GUESS; AND THAT IS ALL THAT CAN BE SAID."

"AND HAVE YOU NEVER KNOWN THE PLEASURE AND TRIUMPH OF A LUCKY GUESS?--I
PITY YOU.--I THOUGHT YOU CLEVERER--FOR, DEPEND UPON IT A LUCKY GUESS IS
NEVER MERELY LUCK. THERE IS ALWAYS SOME TALENT IN IT. AND AS TO MY
POOR WORD 'SUCCESS,' WHICH YOU QUARREL WITH, I DO NOT KNOW THAT I AM SO
ENTIRELY WITHOUT ANY CLAIM TO IT. YOU HAVE DRAWN TWO PRETTY PICTURES;
BUT I THINK THERE MAY BE A THIRD--A SOMETHING BETWEEN THE DO-NOTHING AND
THE DO-ALL. IF I HAD NOT PROMOTED MR. WESTON'S VISITS HERE, AND GIVEN
MANY LITTLE ENCOURAGEMENTS, AND SMOOTHED MANY LITTLE MATTERS, IT MIGHT
NOT HAVE COME TO ANY THING AFTER ALL. I THINK YOU MUST KNOW HARTFIELD
ENOUGH TO COMPREHEND THAT."

"A STRAIGHTFORWARD, OPEN-HEARTED MAN LIKE WESTON, AND A RATIONAL,
UNAFFECTED WOMAN LIKE MISS TAYLOR, MAY BE SAFELY LEFT TO MANAGE THEIR
OWN CONCERNS. YOU ARE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE DONE HARM TO YOURSELF, THAN
GOOD TO THEM, BY INTERFERENCE."

"EMMA NEVER THINKS OF HERSELF, IF SHE CAN DO GOOD TO OTHERS," REJOINED
MR. WOODHOUSE, UNDERSTANDING BUT IN PART. "BUT, MY DEAR, PRAY DO NOT
MAKE ANY MORE MATCHES; THEY ARE SILLY THINGS, AND BREAK UP ONE'S FAMILY
CIRCLE GRIEVOUSLY."

"ONLY ONE MORE, PAPA; ONLY FOR MR. ELTON. POOR MR. ELTON! YOU LIKE MR.
ELTON, PAPA,--I MUST LOOK ABOUT FOR A WIFE FOR HIM. THERE IS NOBODY IN
HIGHBURY WHO DESERVES HIM--AND HE HAS BEEN HERE A WHOLE YEAR, AND HAS
FITTED UP HIS HOUSE SO COMFORTABLY, THAT IT WOULD BE A SHAME TO HAVE HIM
SINGLE ANY LONGER--AND I THOUGHT WHEN HE WAS JOINING THEIR HANDS TO-DAY,
HE LOOKED SO VERY MUCH AS IF HE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THE SAME KIND OFFICE
DONE FOR HIM! I THINK VERY WELL OF MR. ELTON, AND THIS IS THE ONLY WAY I
HAVE OF DOING HIM A SERVICE."

"MR. ELTON IS A VERY PRETTY YOUNG MAN, TO BE SURE, AND A VERY GOOD YOUNG
MAN, AND I HAVE A GREAT REGARD FOR HIM. BUT IF YOU WANT TO SHEW HIM ANY
ATTENTION, MY DEAR, ASK HIM TO COME AND DINE WITH US SOME DAY. THAT WILL
BE A MUCH BETTER THING. I DARE SAY MR. KNIGHTLEY WILL BE SO KIND AS TO
MEET HIM."

"WITH A GREAT DEAL OF PLEASURE, SIR, AT ANY TIME," SAID MR. KNIGHTLEY,
LAUGHING, "AND I AGREE WITH YOU ENTIRELY, THAT IT WILL BE A MUCH BETTER
THING. INVITE HIM TO DINNER, EMMA, AND HELP HIM TO THE BEST OF THE FISH
AND THE CHICKEN, BUT LEAVE HIM TO CHUSE HIS OWN WIFE. DEPEND UPON IT, A
MAN OF SIX OR SEVEN-AND-TWENTY CAN TAKE CARE OF HIMSELF."



CHAPTER II


MR. WESTON WAS A NATIVE OF HIGHBURY, AND BORN OF A RESPECTABLE FAMILY,
WHICH FOR THE LAST TWO OR THREE GENERATIONS HAD BEEN RISING INTO
GENTILITY AND PROPERTY. HE HAD RECEIVED A GOOD EDUCATION, BUT, ON
SUCCEEDING EARLY IN LIFE TO A SMALL INDEPENDENCE, HAD BECOME INDISPOSED
FOR ANY OF THE MORE HOMELY PURSUITS IN WHICH HIS BROTHERS WERE ENGAGED,
AND HAD SATISFIED AN ACTIVE, CHEERFUL MIND AND SOCIAL TEMPER BY ENTERING
INTO THE MILITIA OF HIS COUNTY, THEN EMBODIED.

CAPTAIN WESTON WAS A GENERAL FAVOURITE; AND WHEN THE CHANCES OF HIS
MILITARY LIFE HAD INTRODUCED HIM TO MISS CHURCHILL, OF A GREAT YORKSHIRE
FAMILY, AND MISS CHURCHILL FELL IN LOVE WITH HIM, NOBODY WAS SURPRIZED,
EXCEPT HER BROTHER AND HIS WIFE, WHO HAD NEVER SEEN HIM, AND WHO WERE
FULL OF PRIDE AND IMPORTANCE, WHICH THE CONNEXION WOULD OFFEND.

MISS CHURCHILL, HOWEVER, BEING OF AGE, AND WITH THE FULL COMMAND OF HER
FORTUNE--THOUGH HER FORTUNE BORE NO PROPORTION TO THE FAMILY-ESTATE--WAS
NOT TO BE DISSUADED FROM THE MARRIAGE, AND IT TOOK PLACE, TO THE
INFINITE MORTIFICATION OF MR. AND MRS. CHURCHILL, WHO THREW HER OFF WITH
DUE DECORUM. IT WAS AN UNSUITABLE CONNEXION, AND DID NOT PRODUCE MUCH
HAPPINESS. MRS. WESTON OUGHT TO HAVE FOUND MORE IN IT, FOR SHE HAD A
HUSBAND WHOSE WARM HEART AND SWEET TEMPER MADE HIM THINK EVERY THING DUE
TO HER IN RETURN FOR THE GREAT GOODNESS OF BEING IN LOVE WITH HIM;
BUT THOUGH SHE HAD ONE SORT OF SPIRIT, SHE HAD NOT THE BEST. SHE HAD
RESOLUTION ENOUGH TO PURSUE HER OWN WILL IN SPITE OF HER BROTHER,
BUT NOT ENOUGH TO REFRAIN FROM UNREASONABLE REGRETS AT THAT BROTHER'S
UNREASONABLE ANGER, NOR FROM MISSING THE LUXURIES OF HER FORMER HOME.
THEY LIVED BEYOND THEIR INCOME, BUT STILL IT WAS NOTHING IN COMPARISON
OF ENSCOMBE: SHE DID NOT CEASE TO LOVE HER HUSBAND, BUT SHE WANTED AT
ONCE TO BE THE WIFE OF CAPTAIN WESTON, AND MISS CHURCHILL OF ENSCOMBE.

CAPTAIN WESTON, WHO HAD BEEN CONSIDERED, ESPECIALLY BY THE CHURCHILLS,
AS MAKING SUCH AN AMAZING MATCH, WAS PROVED TO HAVE MUCH THE WORST OF
THE BARGAIN; FOR WHEN HIS WIFE DIED, AFTER A THREE YEARS' MARRIAGE, HE
WAS RATHER A POORER MAN THAN AT FIRST, AND WITH A CHILD TO MAINTAIN.
FROM THE EXPENSE OF THE CHILD, HOWEVER, HE WAS SOON RELIEVED. THE BOY
HAD, WITH THE ADDITIONAL SOFTENING CLAIM OF A LINGERING ILLNESS OF HIS
MOTHER'S, BEEN THE MEANS OF A SORT OF RECONCILIATION; AND MR. AND MRS.
CHURCHILL, HAVING NO CHILDREN OF THEIR OWN, NOR ANY OTHER YOUNG CREATURE
OF EQUAL KINDRED TO CARE FOR, OFFERED TO TAKE THE WHOLE CHARGE OF THE
LITTLE FRANK SOON AFTER HER DECEASE. SOME SCRUPLES AND SOME RELUCTANCE
THE WIDOWER-FATHER MAY BE SUPPOSED TO HAVE FELT; BUT AS THEY WERE
OVERCOME BY OTHER CONSIDERATIONS, THE CHILD WAS GIVEN UP TO THE CARE AND
THE WEALTH OF THE CHURCHILLS, AND HE HAD ONLY HIS OWN COMFORT TO SEEK,
AND HIS OWN SITUATION TO IMPROVE AS HE COULD.

A COMPLETE CHANGE OF LIFE BECAME DESIRABLE. HE QUITTED THE MILITIA AND
ENGAGED IN TRADE, HAVING BROTHERS ALREADY ESTABLISHED IN A GOOD WAY IN
LONDON, WHICH AFFORDED HIM A FAVOURABLE OPENING. IT WAS A CONCERN WHICH
BROUGHT JUST EMPLOYMENT ENOUGH. HE HAD STILL A SMALL HOUSE IN HIGHBURY,
WHERE MOST OF HIS LEISURE DAYS WERE SPENT; AND BETWEEN USEFUL OCCUPATION
AND THE PLEASURES OF SOCIETY, THE NEXT EIGHTEEN OR TWENTY YEARS OF HIS
LIFE PASSED CHEERFULLY AWAY. HE HAD, BY THAT TIME, REALISED AN EASY
COMPETENCE--ENOUGH TO SECURE THE PURCHASE OF A LITTLE ESTATE ADJOINING
HIGHBURY, WHICH HE HAD ALWAYS LONGED FOR--ENOUGH TO MARRY A WOMAN AS
PORTIONLESS EVEN AS MISS TAYLOR, AND TO LIVE ACCORDING TO THE WISHES OF
HIS OWN FRIENDLY AND SOCIAL DISPOSITION.

IT WAS NOW SOME TIME SINCE MISS TAYLOR HAD BEGUN TO INFLUENCE HIS
SCHEMES; BUT AS IT WAS NOT THE TYRANNIC INFLUENCE OF YOUTH ON YOUTH,
IT HAD NOT SHAKEN HIS DETERMINATION OF NEVER SETTLING TILL HE COULD
PURCHASE RANDALLS, AND THE SALE OF RANDALLS WAS LONG LOOKED FORWARD TO;
BUT HE HAD GONE STEADILY ON, WITH THESE OBJECTS IN VIEW, TILL THEY WERE
ACCOMPLISHED. HE HAD MADE HIS FORTUNE, BOUGHT HIS HOUSE, AND OBTAINED
HIS WIFE; AND WAS BEGINNING A NEW PERIOD OF EXISTENCE, WITH EVERY
PROBABILITY OF GREATER HAPPINESS THAN IN ANY YET PASSED THROUGH. HE HAD
NEVER BEEN AN UNHAPPY MAN; HIS OWN TEMPER HAD SECURED HIM FROM THAT,
EVEN IN HIS FIRST MARRIAGE; BUT HIS SECOND MUST SHEW HIM HOW DELIGHTFUL
A WELL-JUDGING AND TRULY AMIABLE WOMAN COULD BE, AND MUST GIVE HIM THE
PLEASANTEST PROOF OF ITS BEING A GREAT DEAL BETTER TO CHOOSE THAN TO BE
CHOSEN, TO EXCITE GRATITUDE THAN TO FEEL IT.

HE HAD ONLY HIMSELF TO PLEASE IN HIS CHOICE: HIS FORTUNE WAS HIS OWN;
FOR AS TO FRANK, IT WAS MORE THAN BEING TACITLY BROUGHT UP AS HIS
UNCLE'S HEIR, IT HAD BECOME SO AVOWED AN ADOPTION AS TO HAVE HIM ASSUME
THE NAME OF CHURCHILL ON COMING OF AGE. IT WAS MOST UNLIKELY, THEREFORE,
THAT HE SHOULD EVER WANT HIS FATHER'S ASSISTANCE. HIS FATHER HAD NO
APPREHENSION OF IT. THE AUNT WAS A CAPRICIOUS WOMAN, AND GOVERNED HER
HUSBAND ENTIRELY; BUT IT WAS NOT IN MR. WESTON'S NATURE TO IMAGINE THAT
ANY CAPRICE COULD BE STRONG ENOUGH TO AFFECT ONE SO DEAR, AND, AS HE
BELIEVED, SO DESERVEDLY DEAR. HE SAW HIS SON EVERY YEAR IN LONDON, AND
WAS PROUD OF HIM; AND HIS FOND REPORT OF HIM AS A VERY FINE YOUNG MAN
HAD MADE HIGHBURY FEEL A SORT OF PRIDE IN HIM TOO. HE WAS LOOKED ON AS
SUFFICIENTLY BELONGING TO THE PLACE TO MAKE HIS MERITS AND PROSPECTS A
KIND OF COMMON CONCERN.

MR. FRANK CHURCHILL WAS ONE OF THE BOASTS OF HIGHBURY, AND A LIVELY
CURIOSITY TO SEE HIM PREVAILED, THOUGH THE COMPLIMENT WAS SO LITTLE
RETURNED THAT HE HAD NEVER BEEN THERE IN HIS LIFE. HIS COMING TO VISIT
HIS FATHER HAD BEEN OFTEN TALKED OF BUT NEVER ACHIEVED.

NOW, UPON HIS FATHER'S MARRIAGE, IT WAS VERY GENERALLY PROPOSED, AS A
MOST PROPER ATTENTION, THAT THE VISIT SHOULD TAKE PLACE. THERE WAS NOT A
DISSENTIENT VOICE ON THE SUBJECT, EITHER WHEN MRS. PERRY DRANK TEA WITH
MRS. AND MISS BATES, OR WHEN MRS. AND MISS BATES RETURNED THE VISIT. NOW
WAS THE TIME FOR MR. FRANK CHURCHILL TO COME AMONG THEM; AND THE HOPE
STRENGTHENED WHEN IT WAS UNDERSTOOD THAT HE HAD WRITTEN TO HIS NEW
MOTHER ON THE OCCASION. FOR A FEW DAYS, EVERY MORNING VISIT IN HIGHBURY
INCLUDED SOME MENTION OF THE HANDSOME LETTER MRS. WESTON HAD RECEIVED.
"I SUPPOSE YOU HAVE HEARD OF THE HANDSOME LETTER MR. FRANK CHURCHILL
HAS WRITTEN TO MRS. WESTON? I UNDERSTAND IT WAS A VERY HANDSOME LETTER,
INDEED. MR. WOODHOUSE TOLD ME OF IT. MR. WOODHOUSE SAW THE LETTER, AND
HE SAYS HE NEVER SAW SUCH A HANDSOME LETTER IN HIS LIFE."

IT WAS, INDEED, A HIGHLY PRIZED LETTER. MRS. WESTON HAD, OF COURSE,
FORMED A VERY FAVOURABLE IDEA OF THE YOUNG MAN; AND SUCH A PLEASING
ATTENTION WAS AN IRRESISTIBLE PROOF OF HIS GREAT GOOD SENSE, AND A MOST
WELCOME ADDITION TO EVERY SOURCE AND EVERY EXPRESSION OF CONGRATULATION
WHICH HER MARRIAGE HAD ALREADY SECURED. SHE FELT HERSELF A MOST
FORTUNATE WOMAN; AND SHE HAD LIVED LONG ENOUGH TO KNOW HOW FORTUNATE
SHE MIGHT WELL BE THOUGHT, WHERE THE ONLY REGRET WAS FOR A PARTIAL
SEPARATION FROM FRIENDS WHOSE FRIENDSHIP FOR HER HAD NEVER COOLED, AND
WHO COULD ILL BEAR TO PART WITH HER.

SHE KNEW THAT AT TIMES SHE MUST BE MISSED; AND COULD NOT THINK, WITHOUT
PAIN, OF EMMA'S LOSING A SINGLE PLEASURE, OR SUFFERING AN HOUR'S ENNUI,
FROM THE WANT OF HER COMPANIONABLENESS: BUT DEAR EMMA WAS OF NO FEEBLE
CHARACTER; SHE WAS MORE EQUAL TO HER SITUATION THAN MOST GIRLS WOULD
HAVE BEEN, AND HAD SENSE, AND ENERGY, AND SPIRITS THAT MIGHT BE HOPED
WOULD BEAR HER WELL AND HAPPILY THROUGH ITS LITTLE DIFFICULTIES AND
PRIVATIONS. AND THEN THERE WAS SUCH COMFORT IN THE VERY EASY DISTANCE OF
RANDALLS FROM HARTFIELD, SO CONVENIENT FOR EVEN SOLITARY FEMALE WALKING,
AND IN MR. WESTON'S DISPOSITION AND CIRCUMSTANCES, WHICH WOULD MAKE THE
APPROACHING SEASON NO HINDRANCE TO THEIR SPENDING HALF THE EVENINGS IN
THE WEEK TOGETHER.

HER SITUATION WAS ALTOGETHER THE SUBJECT OF HOURS OF GRATITUDE TO MRS.
WESTON, AND OF MOMENTS ONLY OF REGRET; AND HER SATISFACTION--HER MORE
THAN SATISFACTION--HER CHEERFUL ENJOYMENT, WAS SO JUST AND SO APPARENT,
THAT EMMA, WELL AS SHE KNEW HER FATHER, WAS SOMETIMES TAKEN BY SURPRIZE
AT HIS BEING STILL ABLE TO PITY 'POOR MISS TAYLOR,' WHEN THEY LEFT HER
AT RANDALLS IN THE CENTRE OF EVERY DOMESTIC COMFORT, OR SAW HER GO AWAY
IN THE EVENING ATTENDED BY HER PLEASANT HUSBAND TO A CARRIAGE OF HER
OWN. BUT NEVER DID SHE GO WITHOUT MR. WOODHOUSE'S GIVING A GENTLE SIGH,
AND SAYING, "AH, POOR MISS TAYLOR! SHE WOULD BE VERY GLAD TO STAY."

THERE WAS NO RECOVERING MISS TAYLOR--NOR MUCH LIKELIHOOD OF CEASING TO
PITY HER; BUT A FEW WEEKS BROUGHT SOME ALLEVIATION TO MR. WOODHOUSE.
THE COMPLIMENTS OF HIS NEIGHBOURS WERE OVER; HE WAS NO LONGER TEASED BY
BEING WISHED JOY OF SO SORROWFUL AN EVENT; AND THE WEDDING-CAKE, WHICH
HAD BEEN A GREAT DISTRESS TO HIM, WAS ALL EAT UP. HIS OWN STOMACH
COULD BEAR NOTHING RICH, AND HE COULD NEVER BELIEVE OTHER PEOPLE TO BE
DIFFERENT FROM HIMSELF. WHAT WAS UNWHOLESOME TO HIM HE REGARDED AS UNFIT
FOR ANY BODY; AND HE HAD, THEREFORE, EARNESTLY TRIED TO DISSUADE THEM
FROM HAVING ANY WEDDING-CAKE AT ALL, AND WHEN THAT PROVED VAIN, AS
EARNESTLY TRIED TO PREVENT ANY BODY'S EATING IT. HE HAD BEEN AT THE
PAINS OF CONSULTING MR. PERRY, THE APOTHECARY, ON THE SUBJECT. MR. PERRY
WAS AN INTELLIGENT, GENTLEMANLIKE MAN, WHOSE FREQUENT VISITS WERE ONE
OF THE COMFORTS OF MR. WOODHOUSE'S LIFE; AND UPON BEING APPLIED TO, HE
COULD NOT BUT ACKNOWLEDGE (THOUGH IT SEEMED RATHER AGAINST THE BIAS
OF INCLINATION) THAT WEDDING-CAKE MIGHT CERTAINLY DISAGREE WITH
MANY--PERHAPS WITH MOST PEOPLE, UNLESS TAKEN MODERATELY. WITH SUCH AN
OPINION, IN CONFIRMATION OF HIS OWN, MR. WOODHOUSE HOPED TO INFLUENCE
EVERY VISITOR OF THE NEWLY MARRIED PAIR; BUT STILL THE CAKE WAS EATEN;
AND THERE WAS NO REST FOR HIS BENEVOLENT NERVES TILL IT WAS ALL GONE.

THERE WAS A STRANGE RUMOUR IN HIGHBURY OF ALL THE LITTLE PERRYS BEING
SEEN WITH A SLICE OF MRS. WESTON'S WEDDING-CAKE IN THEIR HANDS: BUT MR.
WOODHOUSE WOULD NEVER BELIEVE IT.



CHAPTER III


MR. WOODHOUSE WAS FOND OF SOCIETY IN HIS OWN WAY. HE LIKED VERY MUCH TO
HAVE HIS FRIENDS COME AND SEE HIM; AND FROM VARIOUS UNITED CAUSES, FROM
HIS LONG RESIDENCE AT HARTFIELD, AND HIS GOOD NATURE, FROM HIS FORTUNE,
HIS HOUSE, AND HIS DAUGHTER, HE COULD COMMAND THE VISITS OF HIS
OWN LITTLE CIRCLE, IN A GREAT MEASURE, AS HE LIKED. HE HAD NOT MUCH
INTERCOURSE WITH ANY FAMILIES BEYOND THAT CIRCLE; HIS HORROR OF LATE
HOURS, AND LARGE DINNER-PARTIES, MADE HIM UNFIT FOR ANY ACQUAINTANCE BUT
SUCH AS WOULD VISIT HIM ON HIS OWN TERMS. FORTUNATELY FOR HIM, HIGHBURY,
INCLUDING RANDALLS IN THE SAME PARISH, AND DONWELL ABBEY IN THE PARISH
ADJOINING, THE SEAT OF MR. KNIGHTLEY, COMPREHENDED MANY SUCH. NOT
UNFREQUENTLY, THROUGH EMMA'S PERSUASION, HE HAD SOME OF THE CHOSEN AND
THE BEST TO DINE WITH HIM: BUT EVENING PARTIES WERE WHAT HE PREFERRED;
AND, UNLESS HE FANCIED HIMSELF AT ANY TIME UNEQUAL TO COMPANY, THERE
WAS SCARCELY AN EVENING IN THE WEEK IN WHICH EMMA COULD NOT MAKE UP A
CARD-TABLE FOR HIM.

REAL, LONG-STANDING REGARD BROUGHT THE WESTONS AND MR. KNIGHTLEY; AND BY
MR. ELTON, A YOUNG MAN LIVING ALONE WITHOUT LIKING IT, THE PRIVILEGE
OF EXCHANGING ANY VACANT EVENING OF HIS OWN BLANK SOLITUDE FOR THE
ELEGANCIES AND SOCIETY OF MR. WOODHOUSE'S DRAWING-ROOM, AND THE SMILES
OF HIS LOVELY DAUGHTER, WAS IN NO DANGER OF BEING THROWN AWAY.

AFTER THESE CAME A SECOND SET; AMONG THE MOST COME-AT-ABLE OF WHOM WERE
MRS. AND MISS BATES, AND MRS. GODDARD, THREE LADIES ALMOST ALWAYS AT
THE SERVICE OF AN INVITATION FROM HARTFIELD, AND WHO WERE FETCHED AND
CARRIED HOME SO OFTEN, THAT MR. WOODHOUSE THOUGHT IT NO HARDSHIP FOR
EITHER JAMES OR THE HORSES. HAD IT TAKEN PLACE ONLY ONCE A YEAR, IT
WOULD HAVE BEEN A GRIEVANCE.

MRS. BATES, THE WIDOW OF A FORMER VICAR OF HIGHBURY, WAS A VERY OLD
LADY, ALMOST PAST EVERY THING BUT TEA AND QUADRILLE. SHE LIVED WITH HER
SINGLE DAUGHTER IN A VERY SMALL WAY, AND WAS CONSIDERED WITH ALL THE
REGARD AND RESPECT WHICH A HARMLESS OLD LADY, UNDER SUCH UNTOWARD
CIRCUMSTANCES, CAN EXCITE. HER DAUGHTER ENJOYED A MOST UNCOMMON DEGREE
OF POPULARITY FOR A WOMAN NEITHER YOUNG, HANDSOME, RICH, NOR MARRIED.
MISS BATES STOOD IN THE VERY WORST PREDICAMENT IN THE WORLD FOR HAVING
MUCH OF THE PUBLIC FAVOUR; AND SHE HAD NO INTELLECTUAL SUPERIORITY TO
MAKE ATONEMENT TO HERSELF, OR FRIGHTEN THOSE WHO MIGHT HATE HER INTO
OUTWARD RESPECT. SHE HAD NEVER BOASTED EITHER BEAUTY OR CLEVERNESS. HER
YOUTH HAD PASSED WITHOUT DISTINCTION, AND HER MIDDLE OF LIFE WAS DEVOTED
TO THE CARE OF A FAILING MOTHER, AND THE ENDEAVOUR TO MAKE A SMALL
INCOME GO AS FAR AS POSSIBLE. AND YET SHE WAS A HAPPY WOMAN, AND A WOMAN
WHOM NO ONE NAMED WITHOUT GOOD-WILL. IT WAS HER OWN UNIVERSAL GOOD-WILL
AND CONTENTED TEMPER WHICH WORKED SUCH WONDERS. SHE LOVED EVERY BODY,
WAS INTERESTED IN EVERY BODY'S HAPPINESS, QUICKSIGHTED TO EVERY BODY'S
MERITS; THOUGHT HERSELF A MOST FORTUNATE CREATURE, AND SURROUNDED WITH
BLESSINGS IN SUCH AN EXCELLENT MOTHER, AND SO MANY GOOD NEIGHBOURS
AND FRIENDS, AND A HOME THAT WANTED FOR NOTHING. THE SIMPLICITY AND
CHEERFULNESS OF HER NATURE, HER CONTENTED AND GRATEFUL SPIRIT, WERE A
RECOMMENDATION TO EVERY BODY, AND A MINE OF FELICITY TO HERSELF. SHE WAS
A GREAT TALKER UPON LITTLE MATTERS, WHICH EXACTLY SUITED MR. WOODHOUSE,
FULL OF TRIVIAL COMMUNICATIONS AND HARMLESS GOSSIP.

MRS. GODDARD WAS THE MISTRESS OF A SCHOOL--NOT OF A SEMINARY, OR AN
ESTABLISHMENT, OR ANY THING WHICH PROFESSED, IN LONG SENTENCES OF
REFINED NONSENSE, TO COMBINE LIBERAL ACQUIREMENTS WITH ELEGANT MORALITY,
UPON NEW PRINCIPLES AND NEW SYSTEMS--AND WHERE YOUNG LADIES FOR ENORMOUS
PAY MIGHT BE SCREWED OUT OF HEALTH AND INTO VANITY--BUT A REAL,
HONEST, OLD-FASHIONED BOARDING-SCHOOL, WHERE A REASONABLE QUANTITY OF
ACCOMPLISHMENTS WERE SOLD AT A REASONABLE PRICE, AND WHERE GIRLS MIGHT
BE SENT TO BE OUT OF THE WAY, AND SCRAMBLE THEMSELVES INTO A LITTLE
EDUCATION, WITHOUT ANY DANGER OF COMING BACK PRODIGIES. MRS. GODDARD'S
SCHOOL WAS IN HIGH REPUTE--AND VERY DESERVEDLY; FOR HIGHBURY WAS
RECKONED A PARTICULARLY HEALTHY SPOT: SHE HAD AN AMPLE HOUSE AND GARDEN,
GAVE THE CHILDREN PLENTY OF WHOLESOME FOOD, LET THEM RUN ABOUT A GREAT
DEAL IN THE SUMMER, AND IN WINTER DRESSED THEIR CHILBLAINS WITH HER OWN
HANDS. IT WAS NO WONDER THAT A TRAIN OF TWENTY YOUNG COUPLE NOW WALKED
AFTER HER TO CHURCH. SHE WAS A PLAIN, MOTHERLY KIND OF WOMAN, WHO
HAD WORKED HARD IN HER YOUTH, AND NOW THOUGHT HERSELF ENTITLED TO THE
OCCASIONAL HOLIDAY OF A TEA-VISIT; AND HAVING FORMERLY OWED MUCH TO MR.
WOODHOUSE'S KINDNESS, FELT HIS PARTICULAR CLAIM ON HER TO LEAVE HER NEAT
PARLOUR, HUNG ROUND WITH FANCY-WORK, WHENEVER SHE COULD, AND WIN OR LOSE
A FEW SIXPENCES BY HIS FIRESIDE.

THESE WERE THE LADIES WHOM EMMA FOUND HERSELF VERY FREQUENTLY ABLE TO
COLLECT; AND HAPPY WAS SHE, FOR HER FATHER'S SAKE, IN THE POWER; THOUGH,
AS FAR AS SHE WAS HERSELF CONCERNED, IT WAS NO REMEDY FOR THE ABSENCE OF
MRS. WESTON. SHE WAS DELIGHTED TO SEE HER FATHER LOOK COMFORTABLE, AND
VERY MUCH PLEASED WITH HERSELF FOR CONTRIVING THINGS SO WELL; BUT THE
QUIET PROSINGS OF THREE SUCH WOMEN MADE HER FEEL THAT EVERY EVENING SO
SPENT WAS INDEED ONE OF THE LONG EVENINGS SHE HAD FEARFULLY ANTICIPATED.

AS SHE SAT ONE MORNING, LOOKING FORWARD TO EXACTLY SUCH A CLOSE OF THE
PRESENT DAY, A NOTE WAS BROUGHT FROM MRS. GODDARD, REQUESTING, IN MOST
RESPECTFUL TERMS, TO BE ALLOWED TO BRING MISS SMITH WITH HER; A MOST
WELCOME REQUEST: FOR MISS SMITH WAS A GIRL OF SEVENTEEN, WHOM EMMA KNEW
VERY WELL BY SIGHT, AND HAD LONG FELT AN INTEREST IN, ON ACCOUNT OF
HER BEAUTY. A VERY GRACIOUS INVITATION WAS RETURNED, AND THE EVENING NO
LONGER DREADED BY THE FAIR MISTRESS OF THE MANSION.

HARRIET SMITH WAS THE NATURAL DAUGHTER OF SOMEBODY. SOMEBODY HAD PLACED
HER, SEVERAL YEARS BACK, AT MRS. GODDARD'S SCHOOL, AND SOMEBODY
HAD LATELY RAISED HER FROM THE CONDITION OF SCHOLAR TO THAT OF
PARLOUR-BOARDER. THIS WAS ALL THAT WAS GENERALLY KNOWN OF HER HISTORY.
SHE HAD NO VISIBLE FRIENDS BUT WHAT HAD BEEN ACQUIRED AT HIGHBURY, AND
WAS NOW JUST RETURNED FROM A LONG VISIT IN THE COUNTRY TO SOME YOUNG
LADIES WHO HAD BEEN AT SCHOOL THERE WITH HER.

SHE WAS A VERY PRETTY GIRL, AND HER BEAUTY HAPPENED TO BE OF A SORT
WHICH EMMA PARTICULARLY ADMIRED. SHE WAS SHORT, PLUMP, AND FAIR, WITH A
FINE BLOOM, BLUE EYES, LIGHT HAIR, REGULAR FEATURES, AND A LOOK OF GREAT
SWEETNESS, AND, BEFORE THE END OF THE EVENING, EMMA WAS AS MUCH PLEASED
WITH HER MANNERS AS HER PERSON, AND QUITE DETERMINED TO CONTINUE THE
ACQUAINTANCE.

SHE WAS NOT STRUCK BY ANY THING REMARKABLY CLEVER IN MISS SMITH'S
CONVERSATION, BUT SHE FOUND HER ALTOGETHER VERY ENGAGING--NOT
INCONVENIENTLY SHY, NOT UNWILLING TO TALK--AND YET SO FAR FROM PUSHING,
SHEWING SO PROPER AND BECOMING A DEFERENCE, SEEMING SO PLEASANTLY
GRATEFUL FOR BEING ADMITTED TO HARTFIELD, AND SO ARTLESSLY IMPRESSED
BY THE APPEARANCE OF EVERY THING IN SO SUPERIOR A STYLE TO WHAT SHE HAD
BEEN USED TO, THAT SHE MUST HAVE GOOD SENSE, AND DESERVE ENCOURAGEMENT.
ENCOURAGEMENT SHOULD BE GIVEN. THOSE SOFT BLUE EYES, AND ALL THOSE
NATURAL GRACES, SHOULD NOT BE WASTED ON THE INFERIOR SOCIETY OF HIGHBURY
AND ITS CONNEXIONS. THE ACQUAINTANCE SHE HAD ALREADY FORMED WERE
UNWORTHY OF HER. THE FRIENDS FROM WHOM SHE HAD JUST PARTED, THOUGH VERY
GOOD SORT OF PEOPLE, MUST BE DOING HER HARM. THEY WERE A FAMILY OF THE
NAME OF MARTIN, WHOM EMMA WELL KNEW BY CHARACTER, AS RENTING A LARGE
FARM OF MR. KNIGHTLEY, AND RESIDING IN THE PARISH OF DONWELL--VERY
CREDITABLY, SHE BELIEVED--SHE KNEW MR. KNIGHTLEY THOUGHT HIGHLY OF
THEM--BUT THEY MUST BE COARSE AND UNPOLISHED, AND VERY UNFIT TO BE THE
INTIMATES OF A GIRL WHO WANTED ONLY A LITTLE MORE KNOWLEDGE AND ELEGANCE
TO BE QUITE PERFECT. SHE WOULD NOTICE HER; SHE WOULD IMPROVE HER; SHE
WOULD DETACH HER FROM HER BAD ACQUAINTANCE, AND INTRODUCE HER INTO GOOD
SOCIETY; SHE WOULD FORM HER OPINIONS AND HER MANNERS. IT WOULD BE AN
INTERESTING, AND CERTAINLY A VERY KIND UNDERTAKING; HIGHLY BECOMING HER
OWN SITUATION IN LIFE, HER LEISURE, AND POWERS.

SHE WAS SO BUSY IN ADMIRING THOSE SOFT BLUE EYES, IN TALKING AND
LISTENING, AND FORMING ALL THESE SCHEMES IN THE IN-BETWEENS, THAT THE
EVENING FLEW AWAY AT A VERY UNUSUAL RATE; AND THE SUPPER-TABLE, WHICH
ALWAYS CLOSED SUCH PARTIES, AND FOR WHICH SHE HAD BEEN USED TO SIT AND
WATCH THE DUE TIME, WAS ALL SET OUT AND READY, AND MOVED FORWARDS TO THE
FIRE, BEFORE SHE WAS AWARE. WITH AN ALACRITY BEYOND THE COMMON IMPULSE
OF A SPIRIT WHICH YET WAS NEVER INDIFFERENT TO THE CREDIT OF DOING EVERY
THING WELL AND ATTENTIVELY, WITH THE REAL GOOD-WILL OF A MIND DELIGHTED
WITH ITS OWN IDEAS, DID SHE THEN DO ALL THE HONOURS OF THE MEAL, AND
HELP AND RECOMMEND THE MINCED CHICKEN AND SCALLOPED OYSTERS, WITH AN
URGENCY WHICH SHE KNEW WOULD BE ACCEPTABLE TO THE EARLY HOURS AND CIVIL
SCRUPLES OF THEIR GUESTS.

UPON SUCH OCCASIONS POOR MR. WOODHOUSES FEELINGS WERE IN SAD WARFARE.
HE LOVED TO HAVE THE CLOTH LAID, BECAUSE IT HAD BEEN THE FASHION OF HIS
YOUTH, BUT HIS CONVICTION OF SUPPERS BEING VERY UNWHOLESOME MADE HIM
RATHER SORRY TO SEE ANY THING PUT ON IT; AND WHILE HIS HOSPITALITY WOULD
HAVE WELCOMED HIS VISITORS TO EVERY THING, HIS CARE FOR THEIR HEALTH
MADE HIM GRIEVE THAT THEY WOULD EAT.

SUCH ANOTHER SMALL BASIN OF THIN GRUEL AS HIS OWN WAS ALL THAT HE COULD,
WITH THOROUGH SELF-APPROBATION, RECOMMEND; THOUGH HE MIGHT CONSTRAIN
HIMSELF, WHILE THE LADIES WERE COMFORTABLY CLEARING THE NICER THINGS, TO
SAY:

"MRS. BATES, LET ME PROPOSE YOUR VENTURING ON ONE OF THESE EGGS. AN EGG
BOILED VERY SOFT IS NOT UNWHOLESOME. SERLE UNDERSTANDS BOILING AN EGG
BETTER THAN ANY BODY. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND AN EGG BOILED BY ANY BODY
ELSE; BUT YOU NEED NOT BE AFRAID, THEY ARE VERY SMALL, YOU SEE--ONE OF
OUR SMALL EGGS WILL NOT HURT YOU. MISS BATES, LET EMMA HELP YOU TO A
LITTLE BIT OF TART--A VERY LITTLE BIT. OURS ARE ALL APPLE-TARTS. YOU
NEED NOT BE AFRAID OF UNWHOLESOME PRESERVES HERE. I DO NOT ADVISE THE
CUSTARD. MRS. GODDARD, WHAT SAY YOU TO HALF A GLASS OF WINE? A
SMALL HALF-GLASS, PUT INTO A TUMBLER OF WATER? I DO NOT THINK IT COULD
DISAGREE WITH YOU."

EMMA ALLOWED HER FATHER TO TALK--BUT SUPPLIED HER VISITORS IN A MUCH
MORE SATISFACTORY STYLE, AND ON THE PRESENT EVENING HAD PARTICULAR
PLEASURE IN SENDING THEM AWAY HAPPY. THE HAPPINESS OF MISS SMITH WAS
QUITE EQUAL TO HER INTENTIONS. MISS WOODHOUSE WAS SO GREAT A PERSONAGE
IN HIGHBURY, THAT THE PROSPECT OF THE INTRODUCTION HAD GIVEN AS MUCH
PANIC AS PLEASURE; BUT THE HUMBLE, GRATEFUL LITTLE GIRL WENT OFF WITH
HIGHLY GRATIFIED FEELINGS, DELIGHTED WITH THE AFFABILITY WITH WHICH MISS
WOODHOUSE HAD TREATED HER ALL THE EVENING, AND ACTUALLY SHAKEN HANDS
WITH HER AT LAST!



CHAPTER IV


HARRIET SMITH'S INTIMACY AT HARTFIELD WAS SOON A SETTLED THING. QUICK
AND DECIDED IN HER WAYS, EMMA LOST NO TIME IN INVITING, ENCOURAGING, AND
TELLING HER TO COME VERY OFTEN; AND AS THEIR ACQUAINTANCE INCREASED, SO
DID THEIR SATISFACTION IN EACH OTHER. AS A WALKING COMPANION, EMMA HAD
VERY EARLY FORESEEN HOW USEFUL SHE MIGHT FIND HER. IN THAT RESPECT
MRS. WESTON'S LOSS HAD BEEN IMPORTANT. HER FATHER NEVER WENT BEYOND THE
SHRUBBERY, WHERE TWO DIVISIONS OF THE GROUND SUFFICED HIM FOR HIS LONG
WALK, OR HIS SHORT, AS THE YEAR VARIED; AND SINCE MRS. WESTON'S MARRIAGE
HER EXERCISE HAD BEEN TOO MUCH CONFINED. SHE HAD VENTURED ONCE ALONE TO
RANDALLS, BUT IT WAS NOT PLEASANT; AND A HARRIET SMITH, THEREFORE,
ONE WHOM SHE COULD SUMMON AT ANY TIME TO A WALK, WOULD BE A VALUABLE
ADDITION TO HER PRIVILEGES. BUT IN EVERY RESPECT, AS SHE SAW MORE OF
HER, SHE APPROVED HER, AND WAS CONFIRMED IN ALL HER KIND DESIGNS.

HARRIET CERTAINLY WAS NOT CLEVER, BUT SHE HAD A SWEET, DOCILE, GRATEFUL
DISPOSITION, WAS TOTALLY FREE FROM CONCEIT, AND ONLY DESIRING TO BE
GUIDED BY ANY ONE SHE LOOKED UP TO. HER EARLY ATTACHMENT TO HERSELF
WAS VERY AMIABLE; AND HER INCLINATION FOR GOOD COMPANY, AND POWER OF
APPRECIATING WHAT WAS ELEGANT AND CLEVER, SHEWED THAT THERE WAS NO
WANT OF TASTE, THOUGH STRENGTH OF UNDERSTANDING MUST NOT BE EXPECTED.
ALTOGETHER SHE WAS QUITE CONVINCED OF HARRIET SMITH'S BEING EXACTLY THE
YOUNG FRIEND SHE WANTED--EXACTLY THE SOMETHING WHICH HER HOME REQUIRED.
SUCH A FRIEND AS MRS. WESTON WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION. TWO SUCH COULD
NEVER BE GRANTED. TWO SUCH SHE DID NOT WANT. IT WAS QUITE A DIFFERENT
SORT OF THING, A SENTIMENT DISTINCT AND INDEPENDENT. MRS. WESTON WAS THE
OBJECT OF A REGARD WHICH HAD ITS BASIS IN GRATITUDE AND ESTEEM. HARRIET
WOULD BE LOVED AS ONE TO WHOM SHE COULD BE USEFUL. FOR MRS. WESTON THERE
WAS NOTHING TO BE DONE; FOR HARRIET EVERY THING.

HER FIRST ATTEMPTS AT USEFULNESS WERE IN AN ENDEAVOUR TO FIND OUT WHO
WERE THE PARENTS, BUT HARRIET COULD NOT TELL. SHE WAS READY TO TELL
EVERY THING IN HER POWER, BUT ON THIS SUBJECT QUESTIONS WERE VAIN. EMMA
WAS OBLIGED TO FANCY WHAT SHE LIKED--BUT SHE COULD NEVER BELIEVE THAT IN
THE SAME SITUATION SHE SHOULD NOT HAVE DISCOVERED THE TRUTH. HARRIET
HAD NO PENETRATION. SHE HAD BEEN SATISFIED TO HEAR AND BELIEVE JUST WHAT
MRS. GODDARD CHOSE TO TELL HER; AND LOOKED NO FARTHER.

MRS. GODDARD, AND THE TEACHERS, AND THE GIRLS AND THE AFFAIRS OF
THE SCHOOL IN GENERAL, FORMED NATURALLY A GREAT PART OF THE
CONVERSATION--AND BUT FOR HER ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE MARTINS OF
ABBEY-MILL FARM, IT MUST HAVE BEEN THE WHOLE. BUT THE MARTINS OCCUPIED
HER THOUGHTS A GOOD DEAL; SHE HAD SPENT TWO VERY HAPPY MONTHS WITH THEM,
AND NOW LOVED TO TALK OF THE PLEASURES OF HER VISIT, AND DESCRIBE
THE MANY COMFORTS AND WONDERS OF THE PLACE. EMMA ENCOURAGED HER
TALKATIVENESS--AMUSED BY SUCH A PICTURE OF ANOTHER SET OF BEINGS,
AND ENJOYING THE YOUTHFUL SIMPLICITY WHICH COULD SPEAK WITH SO MUCH
EXULTATION OF MRS. MARTIN'S HAVING "TWO PARLOURS, TWO VERY GOOD
PARLOURS, INDEED; ONE OF THEM QUITE AS LARGE AS MRS. GODDARD'S
DRAWING-ROOM; AND OF HER HAVING AN UPPER MAID WHO HAD LIVED
FIVE-AND-TWENTY YEARS WITH HER; AND OF THEIR HAVING EIGHT COWS, TWO OF
THEM ALDERNEYS, AND ONE A LITTLE WELCH COW, A VERY PRETTY LITTLE WELCH
COW INDEED; AND OF MRS. MARTIN'S SAYING AS SHE WAS SO FOND OF IT,
IT SHOULD BE CALLED HER COW; AND OF THEIR HAVING A VERY HANDSOME
SUMMER-HOUSE IN THEIR GARDEN, WHERE SOME DAY NEXT YEAR THEY WERE ALL TO
DRINK TEA:--A VERY HANDSOME SUMMER-HOUSE, LARGE ENOUGH TO HOLD A DOZEN
PEOPLE."

FOR SOME TIME SHE WAS AMUSED, WITHOUT THINKING BEYOND THE IMMEDIATE
CAUSE; BUT AS SHE CAME TO UNDERSTAND THE FAMILY BETTER, OTHER FEELINGS
AROSE. SHE HAD TAKEN UP A WRONG IDEA, FANCYING IT WAS A MOTHER AND
DAUGHTER, A SON AND SON'S WIFE, WHO ALL LIVED TOGETHER; BUT WHEN IT
APPEARED THAT THE MR. MARTIN, WHO BORE A PART IN THE NARRATIVE, AND WAS
ALWAYS MENTIONED WITH APPROBATION FOR HIS GREAT GOOD-NATURE IN DOING
SOMETHING OR OTHER, WAS A SINGLE MAN; THAT THERE WAS NO YOUNG MRS.
MARTIN, NO WIFE IN THE CASE; SHE DID SUSPECT DANGER TO HER POOR LITTLE
FRIEND FROM ALL THIS HOSPITALITY AND KINDNESS, AND THAT, IF SHE WERE NOT
TAKEN CARE OF, SHE MIGHT BE REQUIRED TO SINK HERSELF FOREVER.

WITH THIS INSPIRITING NOTION, HER QUESTIONS INCREASED IN NUMBER AND
MEANING; AND SHE PARTICULARLY LED HARRIET TO TALK MORE OF MR. MARTIN,
AND THERE WAS EVIDENTLY NO DISLIKE TO IT. HARRIET WAS VERY READY TO
SPEAK OF THE SHARE HE HAD HAD IN THEIR MOONLIGHT WALKS AND MERRY EVENING
GAMES; AND DWELT A GOOD DEAL UPON HIS BEING SO VERY GOOD-HUMOURED AND
OBLIGING. HE HAD GONE THREE MILES ROUND ONE DAY IN ORDER TO BRING HER
SOME WALNUTS, BECAUSE SHE HAD SAID HOW FOND SHE WAS OF THEM, AND IN
EVERY THING ELSE HE WAS SO VERY OBLIGING. HE HAD HIS SHEPHERD'S SON INTO
THE PARLOUR ONE NIGHT ON PURPOSE TO SING TO HER. SHE WAS VERY FOND
OF SINGING. HE COULD SING A LITTLE HIMSELF. SHE BELIEVED HE WAS VERY
CLEVER, AND UNDERSTOOD EVERY THING. HE HAD A VERY FINE FLOCK, AND, WHILE
SHE WAS WITH THEM, HE HAD BEEN BID MORE FOR HIS WOOL THAN ANY BODY IN
THE COUNTRY. SHE BELIEVED EVERY BODY SPOKE WELL OF HIM. HIS MOTHER AND
SISTERS WERE VERY FOND OF HIM. MRS. MARTIN HAD TOLD HER ONE DAY (AND
THERE WAS A BLUSH AS SHE SAID IT,) THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ANY BODY
TO BE A BETTER SON, AND THEREFORE SHE WAS SURE, WHENEVER HE MARRIED, HE
WOULD MAKE A GOOD HUSBAND. NOT THAT SHE WANTED HIM TO MARRY. SHE WAS
IN NO HURRY AT ALL.

"WELL DONE, MRS. MARTIN!" THOUGHT EMMA. "YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE ABOUT."

"AND WHEN SHE HAD COME AWAY, MRS. MARTIN WAS SO VERY KIND AS TO SEND
MRS. GODDARD A BEAUTIFUL GOOSE--THE FINEST GOOSE MRS. GODDARD HAD EVER
SEEN. MRS. GODDARD HAD DRESSED IT ON A SUNDAY, AND ASKED ALL THE THREE
TEACHERS, MISS NASH, AND MISS PRINCE, AND MISS RICHARDSON, TO SUP WITH
HER."

"MR. MARTIN, I SUPPOSE, IS NOT A MAN OF INFORMATION BEYOND THE LINE OF
HIS OWN BUSINESS? HE DOES NOT READ?"

"OH YES!--THAT IS, NO--I DO NOT KNOW--BUT I BELIEVE HE HAS READ A
GOOD DEAL--BUT NOT WHAT YOU WOULD THINK ANY THING OF. HE READS THE
AGRICULTURAL REPORTS, AND SOME OTHER BOOKS THAT LAY IN ONE OF THE WINDOW
SEATS--BUT HE READS ALL THEM TO HIMSELF. BUT SOMETIMES OF AN EVENING,
BEFORE WE WENT TO CARDS, HE WOULD READ SOMETHING ALOUD OUT OF THE
ELEGANT EXTRACTS, VERY ENTERTAINING. AND I KNOW HE HAS READ THE VICAR OF
WAKEFIELD. HE NEVER READ THE ROMANCE OF THE FOREST, NOR THE CHILDREN OF
THE ABBEY. HE HAD NEVER HEARD OF SUCH BOOKS BEFORE I MENTIONED THEM, BUT
HE IS DETERMINED TO GET THEM NOW AS SOON AS EVER HE CAN."

THE NEXT QUESTION WAS--

"WHAT SORT OF LOOKING MAN IS MR. MARTIN?"

"OH! NOT HANDSOME--NOT AT ALL HANDSOME. I THOUGHT HIM VERY PLAIN AT
FIRST, BUT I DO NOT THINK HIM SO PLAIN NOW. ONE DOES NOT, YOU KNOW,
AFTER A TIME. BUT DID YOU NEVER SEE HIM? HE IS IN HIGHBURY EVERY NOW AND
THEN, AND HE IS SURE TO RIDE THROUGH EVERY WEEK IN HIS WAY TO KINGSTON.
HE HAS PASSED YOU VERY OFTEN."

"THAT MAY BE, AND I MAY HAVE SEEN HIM FIFTY TIMES, BUT WITHOUT HAVING
ANY IDEA OF HIS NAME. A YOUNG FARMER, WHETHER ON HORSEBACK OR ON FOOT,
IS THE VERY LAST SORT OF PERSON TO RAISE MY CURIOSITY. THE YEOMANRY ARE
PRECISELY THE ORDER OF PEOPLE WITH WHOM I FEEL I CAN HAVE NOTHING TO DO.
A DEGREE OR TWO LOWER, AND A CREDITABLE APPEARANCE MIGHT INTEREST ME;
I MIGHT HOPE TO BE USEFUL TO THEIR FAMILIES IN SOME WAY OR OTHER. BUT
A FARMER CAN NEED NONE OF MY HELP, AND IS, THEREFORE, IN ONE SENSE, AS
MUCH ABOVE MY NOTICE AS IN EVERY OTHER HE IS BELOW IT."

"TO BE SURE. OH YES! IT IS NOT LIKELY YOU SHOULD EVER HAVE OBSERVED HIM;
BUT HE KNOWS YOU VERY WELL INDEED--I MEAN BY SIGHT."

"I HAVE NO DOUBT OF HIS BEING A VERY RESPECTABLE YOUNG MAN. I KNOW,
INDEED, THAT HE IS SO, AND, AS SUCH, WISH HIM WELL. WHAT DO YOU IMAGINE
HIS AGE TO BE?"

"HE WAS FOUR-AND-TWENTY THE 8TH OF LAST JUNE, AND MY BIRTHDAY IS THE
23RD JUST A FORTNIGHT AND A DAY'S DIFFERENCE--WHICH IS VERY ODD."

"ONLY FOUR-AND-TWENTY. THAT IS TOO YOUNG TO SETTLE. HIS MOTHER IS
PERFECTLY RIGHT NOT TO BE IN A HURRY. THEY SEEM VERY COMFORTABLE AS THEY
ARE, AND IF SHE WERE TO TAKE ANY PAINS TO MARRY HIM, SHE WOULD PROBABLY
REPENT IT. SIX YEARS HENCE, IF HE COULD MEET WITH A GOOD SORT OF YOUNG
WOMAN IN THE SAME RANK AS HIS OWN, WITH A LITTLE MONEY, IT MIGHT BE VERY
DESIRABLE."

"SIX YEARS HENCE! DEAR MISS WOODHOUSE, HE WOULD BE THIRTY YEARS OLD!"

"WELL, AND THAT IS AS EARLY AS MOST MEN CAN AFFORD TO MARRY, WHO ARE NOT
BORN TO AN INDEPENDENCE. MR. MARTIN, I IMAGINE, HAS HIS FORTUNE ENTIRELY
TO MAKE--CANNOT BE AT ALL BEFOREHAND WITH THE WORLD. WHATEVER MONEY HE
MIGHT COME INTO WHEN HIS FATHER DIED, WHATEVER HIS SHARE OF THE FAMILY
PROPERTY, IT IS, I DARE SAY, ALL AFLOAT, ALL EMPLOYED IN HIS STOCK, AND
SO FORTH; AND THOUGH, WITH DILIGENCE AND GOOD LUCK, HE MAY BE RICH IN
TIME, IT IS NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE THAT HE SHOULD HAVE REALISED ANY THING
YET."

"TO BE SURE, SO IT IS. BUT THEY LIVE VERY COMFORTABLY. THEY HAVE NO
INDOORS MAN, ELSE THEY DO NOT WANT FOR ANY THING; AND MRS. MARTIN TALKS
OF TAKING A BOY ANOTHER YEAR."

"I WISH YOU MAY NOT GET INTO A SCRAPE, HARRIET, WHENEVER HE DOES
MARRY;--I MEAN, AS TO BEING ACQUAINTED WITH HIS WIFE--FOR THOUGH HIS
SISTERS, FROM A SUPERIOR EDUCATION, ARE NOT TO BE ALTOGETHER OBJECTED
TO, IT DOES NOT FOLLOW THAT HE MIGHT MARRY ANY BODY AT ALL FIT FOR YOU
TO NOTICE. THE MISFORTUNE OF YOUR BIRTH OUGHT TO MAKE YOU PARTICULARLY
CAREFUL AS TO YOUR ASSOCIATES. THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT OF YOUR BEING A
GENTLEMAN'S DAUGHTER, AND YOU MUST SUPPORT YOUR CLAIM TO THAT STATION BY
EVERY THING WITHIN YOUR OWN POWER, OR THERE WILL BE PLENTY OF PEOPLE WHO
WOULD TAKE PLEASURE IN DEGRADING YOU."

"YES, TO BE SURE, I SUPPOSE THERE ARE. BUT WHILE I VISIT AT HARTFIELD,
AND YOU ARE SO KIND TO ME, MISS WOODHOUSE, I AM NOT AFRAID OF WHAT ANY
BODY CAN DO."

"YOU UNDERSTAND THE FORCE OF INFLUENCE PRETTY WELL, HARRIET; BUT I WOULD
HAVE YOU SO FIRMLY ESTABLISHED IN GOOD SOCIETY, AS TO BE INDEPENDENT
EVEN OF HARTFIELD AND MISS WOODHOUSE. I WANT TO SEE YOU PERMANENTLY
WELL CONNECTED, AND TO THAT END IT WILL BE ADVISABLE TO HAVE AS FEW ODD
ACQUAINTANCE AS MAY BE; AND, THEREFORE, I SAY THAT IF YOU SHOULD STILL
BE IN THIS COUNTRY WHEN MR. MARTIN MARRIES, I WISH YOU MAY NOT BE DRAWN
IN BY YOUR INTIMACY WITH THE SISTERS, TO BE ACQUAINTED WITH THE WIFE,
WHO WILL PROBABLY BE SOME MERE FARMER'S DAUGHTER, WITHOUT EDUCATION."

"TO BE SURE. YES. NOT THAT I THINK MR. MARTIN WOULD EVER MARRY ANY BODY
BUT WHAT HAD HAD SOME EDUCATION--AND BEEN VERY WELL BROUGHT UP. HOWEVER,
I DO NOT MEAN TO SET UP MY OPINION AGAINST YOURS--AND I AM SURE I SHALL
NOT WISH FOR THE ACQUAINTANCE OF HIS WIFE. I SHALL ALWAYS HAVE A GREAT
REGARD FOR THE MISS MARTINS, ESPECIALLY ELIZABETH, AND SHOULD BE VERY
SORRY TO GIVE THEM UP, FOR THEY ARE QUITE AS WELL EDUCATED AS ME. BUT
IF HE MARRIES A VERY IGNORANT, VULGAR WOMAN, CERTAINLY I HAD BETTER NOT
VISIT HER, IF I CAN HELP IT."

EMMA WATCHED HER THROUGH THE FLUCTUATIONS OF THIS SPEECH, AND SAW NO
ALARMING SYMPTOMS OF LOVE. THE YOUNG MAN HAD BEEN THE FIRST ADMIRER, BUT
SHE TRUSTED THERE WAS NO OTHER HOLD, AND THAT THERE WOULD BE NO SERIOUS
DIFFICULTY, ON HARRIET'S SIDE, TO OPPOSE ANY FRIENDLY ARRANGEMENT OF HER
OWN.

THEY MET MR. MARTIN THE VERY NEXT DAY, AS THEY WERE WALKING ON THE
DONWELL ROAD. HE WAS ON FOOT, AND AFTER LOOKING VERY RESPECTFULLY AT
HER, LOOKED WITH MOST UNFEIGNED SATISFACTION AT HER COMPANION. EMMA WAS
NOT SORRY TO HAVE SUCH AN OPPORTUNITY OF SURVEY; AND WALKING A FEW
YARDS FORWARD, WHILE THEY TALKED TOGETHER, SOON MADE HER QUICK EYE
SUFFICIENTLY ACQUAINTED WITH MR. ROBERT MARTIN. HIS APPEARANCE WAS VERY
NEAT, AND HE LOOKED LIKE A SENSIBLE YOUNG MAN, BUT HIS PERSON HAD NO
OTHER ADVANTAGE; AND WHEN HE CAME TO BE CONTRASTED WITH GENTLEMEN,
SHE THOUGHT HE MUST LOSE ALL THE GROUND HE HAD GAINED IN HARRIET'S
INCLINATION. HARRIET WAS NOT INSENSIBLE OF MANNER; SHE HAD VOLUNTARILY
NOTICED HER FATHER'S GENTLENESS WITH ADMIRATION AS WELL AS WONDER. MR.
MARTIN LOOKED AS IF HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT MANNER WAS.

THEY REMAINED BUT A FEW MINUTES TOGETHER, AS MISS WOODHOUSE MUST NOT BE
KEPT WAITING; AND HARRIET THEN CAME RUNNING TO HER WITH A SMILING FACE,
AND IN A FLUTTER OF SPIRITS, WHICH MISS WOODHOUSE HOPED VERY SOON TO
COMPOSE.

"ONLY THINK OF OUR HAPPENING TO MEET HIM!--HOW VERY ODD! IT WAS QUITE
A CHANCE, HE SAID, THAT HE HAD NOT GONE ROUND BY RANDALLS. HE DID NOT
THINK WE EVER WALKED THIS ROAD. HE THOUGHT WE WALKED TOWARDS RANDALLS
MOST DAYS. HE HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET THE ROMANCE OF THE FOREST YET.
HE WAS SO BUSY THE LAST TIME HE WAS AT KINGSTON THAT HE QUITE FORGOT IT,
BUT HE GOES AGAIN TO-MORROW. SO VERY ODD WE SHOULD HAPPEN TO MEET! WELL,
MISS WOODHOUSE, IS HE LIKE WHAT YOU EXPECTED? WHAT DO YOU THINK OF HIM?
DO YOU THINK HIM SO VERY PLAIN?"

"HE IS VERY PLAIN, UNDOUBTEDLY--REMARKABLY PLAIN:--BUT THAT IS NOTHING
COMPARED WITH HIS ENTIRE WANT OF GENTILITY. I HAD NO RIGHT TO EXPECT
MUCH, AND I DID NOT EXPECT MUCH; BUT I HAD NO IDEA THAT HE COULD BE SO
VERY CLOWNISH, SO TOTALLY WITHOUT AIR. I HAD IMAGINED HIM, I CONFESS, A
DEGREE OR TWO NEARER GENTILITY."

"TO BE SURE," SAID HARRIET, IN A MORTIFIED VOICE, "HE IS NOT SO GENTEEL
AS REAL GENTLEMEN."

"I THINK, HARRIET, SINCE YOUR ACQUAINTANCE WITH US, YOU HAVE BEEN
REPEATEDLY IN THE COMPANY OF SOME SUCH VERY REAL GENTLEMEN, THAT YOU
MUST YOURSELF BE STRUCK WITH THE DIFFERENCE IN MR. MARTIN. AT HARTFIELD,
YOU HAVE HAD VERY GOOD SPECIMENS OF WELL EDUCATED, WELL BRED MEN. I
SHOULD BE SURPRIZED IF, AFTER SEEING THEM, YOU COULD BE IN COMPANY
WITH MR. MARTIN AGAIN WITHOUT PERCEIVING HIM TO BE A VERY INFERIOR
CREATURE--AND RATHER WONDERING AT YOURSELF FOR HAVING EVER THOUGHT HIM
AT ALL AGREEABLE BEFORE. DO NOT YOU BEGIN TO FEEL THAT NOW? WERE NOT
YOU STRUCK? I AM SURE YOU MUST HAVE BEEN STRUCK BY HIS AWKWARD LOOK AND
ABRUPT MANNER, AND THE UNCOUTHNESS OF A VOICE WHICH I HEARD TO BE WHOLLY
UNMODULATED AS I STOOD HERE."

"CERTAINLY, HE IS NOT LIKE MR. KNIGHTLEY. HE HAS NOT SUCH A FINE AIR AND
WAY OF WALKING AS MR. KNIGHTLEY. I SEE THE DIFFERENCE PLAIN ENOUGH. BUT
MR. KNIGHTLEY IS SO VERY FINE A MAN!"

"MR. KNIGHTLEY'S AIR IS SO REMARKABLY GOOD THAT IT IS NOT FAIR TO
COMPARE MR. MARTIN WITH HIM. YOU MIGHT NOT SEE ONE IN A HUNDRED WITH
GENTLEMAN SO PLAINLY WRITTEN AS IN MR. KNIGHTLEY. BUT HE IS NOT THE
ONLY GENTLEMAN YOU HAVE BEEN LATELY USED TO. WHAT SAY YOU TO MR. WESTON
AND MR. ELTON? COMPARE MR. MARTIN WITH EITHER OF THEM. COMPARE THEIR
MANNER OF CARRYING THEMSELVES; OF WALKING; OF SPEAKING; OF BEING SILENT.
YOU MUST SEE THE DIFFERENCE."

"OH YES!--THERE IS A GREAT DIFFERENCE. BUT MR. WESTON IS ALMOST AN OLD
MAN. MR. WESTON MUST BE BETWEEN FORTY AND FIFTY."

"WHICH MAKES HIS GOOD MANNERS THE MORE VALUABLE. THE OLDER A PERSON
GROWS, HARRIET, THE MORE IMPORTANT IT IS THAT THEIR MANNERS SHOULD NOT
BE BAD; THE MORE GLARING AND DISGUSTING ANY LOUDNESS, OR COARSENESS, OR
AWKWARDNESS BECOMES. WHAT IS PASSABLE IN YOUTH IS DETESTABLE IN LATER
AGE. MR. MARTIN IS NOW AWKWARD AND ABRUPT; WHAT WILL HE BE AT MR.
WESTON'S TIME OF LIFE?"

"THERE IS NO SAYING, INDEED," REPLIED HARRIET RATHER SOLEMNLY.

"BUT THERE MAY BE PRETTY GOOD GUESSING. HE WILL BE A COMPLETELY GROSS,
VULGAR FARMER, TOTALLY INATTENTIVE TO APPEARANCES, AND THINKING OF
NOTHING BUT PROFIT AND LOSS."

"WILL HE, INDEED? THAT WILL BE VERY BAD."

"HOW MUCH HIS BUSINESS ENGROSSES HIM ALREADY IS VERY PLAIN FROM THE
CIRCUMSTANCE OF HIS FORGETTING TO INQUIRE FOR THE BOOK YOU RECOMMENDED.
HE WAS A GREAT DEAL TOO FULL OF THE MARKET TO THINK OF ANY THING
ELSE--WHICH IS JUST AS IT SHOULD BE, FOR A THRIVING MAN. WHAT HAS HE TO
DO WITH BOOKS? AND I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT HE WILL THRIVE, AND BE A VERY
RICH MAN IN TIME--AND HIS BEING ILLITERATE AND COARSE NEED NOT DISTURB
US."

"I WONDER HE DID NOT REMEMBER THE BOOK"--WAS ALL HARRIET'S ANSWER, AND
SPOKEN WITH A DEGREE OF GRAVE DISPLEASURE WHICH EMMA THOUGHT MIGHT BE
SAFELY LEFT TO ITSELF. SHE, THEREFORE, SAID NO MORE FOR SOME TIME. HER
NEXT BEGINNING WAS,

"IN ONE RESPECT, PERHAPS, MR. ELTON'S MANNERS ARE SUPERIOR TO MR.
KNIGHTLEY'S OR MR. WESTON'S. THEY HAVE MORE GENTLENESS. THEY MIGHT BE
MORE SAFELY HELD UP AS A PATTERN. THERE IS AN OPENNESS, A QUICKNESS,
ALMOST A BLUNTNESS IN MR. WESTON, WHICH EVERY BODY LIKES IN HIM,
BECAUSE THERE IS SO MUCH GOOD-HUMOUR WITH IT--BUT THAT WOULD NOT DO TO
BE COPIED. NEITHER WOULD MR. KNIGHTLEY'S DOWNRIGHT, DECIDED, COMMANDING
SORT OF MANNER, THOUGH IT SUITS HIM VERY WELL; HIS FIGURE, AND LOOK,
AND SITUATION IN LIFE SEEM TO ALLOW IT; BUT IF ANY YOUNG MAN WERE TO SET
ABOUT COPYING HIM, HE WOULD NOT BE SUFFERABLE. ON THE CONTRARY, I THINK
A YOUNG MAN MIGHT BE VERY SAFELY RECOMMENDED TO TAKE MR. ELTON AS A
MODEL. MR. ELTON IS GOOD-HUMOURED, CHEERFUL, OBLIGING, AND GENTLE.
HE SEEMS TO ME TO BE GROWN PARTICULARLY GENTLE OF LATE. I DO NOT KNOW
WHETHER HE HAS ANY DESIGN OF INGRATIATING HIMSELF WITH EITHER OF US,
HARRIET, BY ADDITIONAL SOFTNESS, BUT IT STRIKES ME THAT HIS MANNERS ARE
SOFTER THAN THEY USED TO BE. IF HE MEANS ANY THING, IT MUST BE TO PLEASE
YOU. DID NOT I TELL YOU WHAT HE SAID OF YOU THE OTHER DAY?"

SHE THEN REPEATED SOME WARM PERSONAL PRAISE WHICH SHE HAD DRAWN FROM MR.
ELTON, AND NOW DID FULL JUSTICE TO; AND HARRIET BLUSHED AND SMILED, AND
SAID SHE HAD ALWAYS THOUGHT MR. ELTON VERY AGREEABLE.

MR. ELTON WAS THE VERY PERSON FIXED ON BY EMMA FOR DRIVING THE YOUNG
FARMER OUT OF HARRIET'S HEAD. SHE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE AN EXCELLENT
MATCH; AND ONLY TOO PALPABLY DESIRABLE, NATURAL, AND PROBABLE, FOR HER
TO HAVE MUCH MERIT IN PLANNING IT. SHE FEARED IT WAS WHAT EVERY BODY
ELSE MUST THINK OF AND PREDICT. IT WAS NOT LIKELY, HOWEVER, THAT ANY
BODY SHOULD HAVE EQUALLED HER IN THE DATE OF THE PLAN, AS IT HAD
ENTERED HER BRAIN DURING THE VERY FIRST EVENING OF HARRIET'S COMING TO
HARTFIELD. THE LONGER SHE CONSIDERED IT, THE GREATER WAS HER SENSE
OF ITS EXPEDIENCY. MR. ELTON'S SITUATION WAS MOST SUITABLE, QUITE THE
GENTLEMAN HIMSELF, AND WITHOUT LOW CONNEXIONS; AT THE SAME TIME, NOT OF
ANY FAMILY THAT COULD FAIRLY OBJECT TO THE DOUBTFUL BIRTH OF HARRIET.
HE HAD A COMFORTABLE HOME FOR HER, AND EMMA IMAGINED A VERY SUFFICIENT
INCOME; FOR THOUGH THE VICARAGE OF HIGHBURY WAS NOT LARGE, HE WAS KNOWN
TO HAVE SOME INDEPENDENT PROPERTY; AND SHE THOUGHT VERY HIGHLY OF HIM
AS A GOOD-HUMOURED, WELL-MEANING, RESPECTABLE YOUNG MAN, WITHOUT ANY
DEFICIENCY OF USEFUL UNDERSTANDING OR KNOWLEDGE OF THE WORLD.

SHE HAD ALREADY SATISFIED HERSELF THAT HE THOUGHT HARRIET A BEAUTIFUL
GIRL, WHICH SHE TRUSTED, WITH SUCH FREQUENT MEETINGS AT HARTFIELD, WAS
FOUNDATION ENOUGH ON HIS SIDE; AND ON HARRIET'S THERE COULD BE LITTLE
DOUBT THAT THE IDEA OF BEING PREFERRED BY HIM WOULD HAVE ALL THE USUAL
WEIGHT AND EFFICACY. AND HE WAS REALLY A VERY PLEASING YOUNG MAN, A
YOUNG MAN WHOM ANY WOMAN NOT FASTIDIOUS MIGHT LIKE. HE WAS RECKONED VERY
HANDSOME; HIS PERSON MUCH ADMIRED IN GENERAL, THOUGH NOT BY HER,
THERE BEING A WANT OF ELEGANCE OF FEATURE WHICH SHE COULD NOT DISPENSE
WITH:--BUT THE GIRL WHO COULD BE GRATIFIED BY A ROBERT MARTIN'S RIDING
ABOUT THE COUNTRY TO GET WALNUTS FOR HER MIGHT VERY WELL BE CONQUERED BY
MR. ELTON'S ADMIRATION.



CHAPTER V


"I DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOUR OPINION MAY BE, MRS. WESTON," SAID MR.
KNIGHTLEY, "OF THIS GREAT INTIMACY BETWEEN EMMA AND HARRIET SMITH, BUT I
THINK IT A BAD THING."

"A BAD THING! DO YOU REALLY THINK IT A BAD THING?--WHY SO?"

"I THINK THEY WILL NEITHER OF THEM DO THE OTHER ANY GOOD."

"YOU SURPRIZE ME! EMMA MUST DO HARRIET GOOD: AND BY SUPPLYING HER WITH A
NEW OBJECT OF INTEREST, HARRIET MAY BE SAID TO DO EMMA GOOD. I HAVE BEEN
SEEING THEIR INTIMACY WITH THE GREATEST PLEASURE. HOW VERY DIFFERENTLY
WE FEEL!--NOT THINK THEY WILL DO EACH OTHER ANY GOOD! THIS WILL
CERTAINLY BE THE BEGINNING OF ONE OF OUR QUARRELS ABOUT EMMA, MR.
KNIGHTLEY."

"PERHAPS YOU THINK I AM COME ON PURPOSE TO QUARREL WITH YOU, KNOWING
WESTON TO BE OUT, AND THAT YOU MUST STILL FIGHT YOUR OWN BATTLE."

"MR. WESTON WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY SUPPORT ME, IF HE WERE HERE, FOR HE THINKS
EXACTLY AS I DO ON THE SUBJECT. WE WERE SPEAKING OF IT ONLY YESTERDAY,
AND AGREEING HOW FORTUNATE IT WAS FOR EMMA, THAT THERE SHOULD BE SUCH A
GIRL IN HIGHBURY FOR HER TO ASSOCIATE WITH. MR. KNIGHTLEY, I SHALL NOT
ALLOW YOU TO BE A FAIR JUDGE IN THIS CASE. YOU ARE SO MUCH USED TO LIVE
ALONE, THAT YOU DO NOT KNOW THE VALUE OF A COMPANION; AND, PERHAPS NO
MAN CAN BE A GOOD JUDGE OF THE COMFORT A WOMAN FEELS IN THE SOCIETY OF
ONE OF HER OWN SEX, AFTER BEING USED TO IT ALL HER LIFE. I CAN IMAGINE
YOUR OBJECTION TO HARRIET SMITH. SHE IS NOT THE SUPERIOR YOUNG WOMAN
WHICH EMMA'S FRIEND OUGHT TO BE. BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, AS EMMA WANTS
TO SEE HER BETTER INFORMED, IT WILL BE AN INDUCEMENT TO HER TO READ MORE
HERSELF. THEY WILL READ TOGETHER. SHE MEANS IT, I KNOW."

"EMMA HAS BEEN MEANING TO READ MORE EVER SINCE SHE WAS TWELVE YEARS OLD.
I HAVE SEEN A GREAT MANY LISTS OF HER DRAWING-UP AT VARIOUS TIMES OF
BOOKS THAT SHE MEANT TO READ REGULARLY THROUGH--AND VERY GOOD LISTS
THEY WERE--VERY WELL CHOSEN, AND VERY NEATLY ARRANGED--SOMETIMES
ALPHABETICALLY, AND SOMETIMES BY SOME OTHER RULE. THE LIST SHE DREW
UP WHEN ONLY FOURTEEN--I REMEMBER THINKING IT DID HER JUDGMENT SO MUCH
CREDIT, THAT I PRESERVED IT SOME TIME; AND I DARE SAY SHE MAY HAVE MADE
OUT A VERY GOOD LIST NOW. BUT I HAVE DONE WITH EXPECTING ANY COURSE OF
STEADY READING FROM EMMA. SHE WILL NEVER SUBMIT TO ANY THING
REQUIRING INDUSTRY AND PATIENCE, AND A SUBJECTION OF THE FANCY TO THE
UNDERSTANDING. WHERE MISS TAYLOR FAILED TO STIMULATE, I MAY SAFELY
AFFIRM THAT HARRIET SMITH WILL DO NOTHING.--YOU NEVER COULD PERSUADE HER
TO READ HALF SO MUCH AS YOU WISHED.--YOU KNOW YOU COULD NOT."

"I DARE SAY," REPLIED MRS. WESTON, SMILING, "THAT I THOUGHT SO
THEN;--BUT SINCE WE HAVE PARTED, I CAN NEVER REMEMBER EMMA'S OMITTING
TO DO ANY THING I WISHED."

"THERE IS HARDLY ANY DESIRING TO REFRESH SUCH A MEMORY AS THAT,"--SAID
MR. KNIGHTLEY, FEELINGLY; AND FOR A MOMENT OR TWO HE HAD DONE. "BUT I,"
HE SOON ADDED, "WHO HAVE HAD NO SUCH CHARM THROWN OVER MY SENSES, MUST
STILL SEE, HEAR, AND REMEMBER. EMMA IS SPOILED BY BEING THE CLEVEREST
OF HER FAMILY. AT TEN YEARS OLD, SHE HAD THE MISFORTUNE OF BEING ABLE TO
ANSWER QUESTIONS WHICH PUZZLED HER SISTER AT SEVENTEEN. SHE WAS ALWAYS
QUICK AND ASSURED: ISABELLA SLOW AND DIFFIDENT. AND EVER SINCE SHE
WAS TWELVE, EMMA HAS BEEN MISTRESS OF THE HOUSE AND OF YOU ALL. IN HER
MOTHER SHE LOST THE ONLY PERSON ABLE TO COPE WITH HER. SHE INHERITS HER
MOTHER'S TALENTS, AND MUST HAVE BEEN UNDER SUBJECTION TO HER."

"I SHOULD HAVE BEEN SORRY, MR. KNIGHTLEY, TO BE DEPENDENT ON YOUR
RECOMMENDATION, HAD I QUITTED MR. WOODHOUSE'S FAMILY AND WANTED ANOTHER
SITUATION; I DO NOT THINK YOU WOULD HAVE SPOKEN A GOOD WORD FOR ME TO
ANY BODY. I AM SURE YOU ALWAYS THOUGHT ME UNFIT FOR THE OFFICE I HELD."

"YES," SAID HE, SMILING. "YOU ARE BETTER PLACED HERE; VERY FIT FOR A
WIFE, BUT NOT AT ALL FOR A GOVERNESS. BUT YOU WERE PREPARING YOURSELF TO
BE AN EXCELLENT WIFE ALL THE TIME YOU WERE AT HARTFIELD. YOU MIGHT
NOT GIVE EMMA SUCH A COMPLETE EDUCATION AS YOUR POWERS WOULD SEEM TO
PROMISE; BUT YOU WERE RECEIVING A VERY GOOD EDUCATION FROM HER, ON THE
VERY MATERIAL MATRIMONIAL POINT OF SUBMITTING YOUR OWN WILL, AND DOING
AS YOU WERE BID; AND IF WESTON HAD ASKED ME TO RECOMMEND HIM A WIFE, I
SHOULD CERTAINLY HAVE NAMED MISS TAYLOR."

"THANK YOU. THERE WILL BE VERY LITTLE MERIT IN MAKING A GOOD WIFE TO
SUCH A MAN AS MR. WESTON."

"WHY, TO OWN THE TRUTH, I AM AFRAID YOU ARE RATHER THROWN AWAY, AND THAT
WITH EVERY DISPOSITION TO BEAR, THERE WILL BE NOTHING TO BE BORNE. WE
WILL NOT DESPAIR, HOWEVER. WESTON MAY GROW CROSS FROM THE WANTONNESS OF
COMFORT, OR HIS SON MAY PLAGUE HIM."

"I HOPE NOT THAT.--IT IS NOT LIKELY. NO, MR. KNIGHTLEY, DO NOT
FORETELL VEXATION FROM THAT QUARTER."

"NOT I, INDEED. I ONLY NAME POSSIBILITIES. I DO NOT PRETEND TO EMMA'S
GENIUS FOR FORETELLING AND GUESSING. I HOPE, WITH ALL MY HEART, THE
YOUNG MAN MAY BE A WESTON IN MERIT, AND A CHURCHILL IN FORTUNE.--BUT
HARRIET SMITH--I HAVE NOT HALF DONE ABOUT HARRIET SMITH. I THINK HER THE
VERY WORST SORT OF COMPANION THAT EMMA COULD POSSIBLY HAVE. SHE KNOWS
NOTHING HERSELF, AND LOOKS UPON EMMA AS KNOWING EVERY THING. SHE IS A
FLATTERER IN ALL HER WAYS; AND SO MUCH THE WORSE, BECAUSE UNDESIGNED.
HER IGNORANCE IS HOURLY FLATTERY. HOW CAN EMMA IMAGINE SHE HAS ANY
THING TO LEARN HERSELF, WHILE HARRIET IS PRESENTING SUCH A DELIGHTFUL
INFERIORITY? AND AS FOR HARRIET, I WILL VENTURE TO SAY THAT SHE CANNOT
GAIN BY THE ACQUAINTANCE. HARTFIELD WILL ONLY PUT HER OUT OF CONCEIT
WITH ALL THE OTHER PLACES SHE BELONGS TO. SHE WILL GROW JUST REFINED
ENOUGH TO BE UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THOSE AMONG WHOM BIRTH AND CIRCUMSTANCES
HAVE PLACED HER HOME. I AM MUCH MISTAKEN IF EMMA'S DOCTRINES GIVE ANY
STRENGTH OF MIND, OR TEND AT ALL TO MAKE A GIRL ADAPT HERSELF RATIONALLY
TO THE VARIETIES OF HER SITUATION IN LIFE.--THEY ONLY GIVE A LITTLE
POLISH."

"I EITHER DEPEND MORE UPON EMMA'S GOOD SENSE THAN YOU DO, OR AM MORE
ANXIOUS FOR HER PRESENT COMFORT; FOR I CANNOT LAMENT THE ACQUAINTANCE.
HOW WELL SHE LOOKED LAST NIGHT!"

"OH! YOU WOULD RATHER TALK OF HER PERSON THAN HER MIND, WOULD YOU? VERY
WELL; I SHALL NOT ATTEMPT TO DENY EMMA'S BEING PRETTY."

"PRETTY! SAY BEAUTIFUL RATHER. CAN YOU IMAGINE ANY THING NEARER PERFECT
BEAUTY THAN EMMA ALTOGETHER--FACE AND FIGURE?"

"I DO NOT KNOW WHAT I COULD IMAGINE, BUT I CONFESS THAT I HAVE SELDOM
SEEN A FACE OR FIGURE MORE PLEASING TO ME THAN HERS. BUT I AM A PARTIAL
OLD FRIEND."

"SUCH AN EYE!--THE TRUE HAZLE EYE--AND SO BRILLIANT! REGULAR FEATURES,
OPEN COUNTENANCE, WITH A COMPLEXION! OH! WHAT A BLOOM OF FULL HEALTH,
AND SUCH A PRETTY HEIGHT AND SIZE; SUCH A FIRM AND UPRIGHT FIGURE!
THERE IS HEALTH, NOT MERELY IN HER BLOOM, BUT IN HER AIR, HER HEAD, HER
GLANCE. ONE HEARS SOMETIMES OF A CHILD BEING 'THE PICTURE OF HEALTH;'
NOW, EMMA ALWAYS GIVES ME THE IDEA OF BEING THE COMPLETE PICTURE OF
GROWN-UP HEALTH. SHE IS LOVELINESS ITSELF. MR. KNIGHTLEY, IS NOT SHE?"

"I HAVE NOT A FAULT TO FIND WITH HER PERSON," HE REPLIED. "I THINK HER
ALL YOU DESCRIBE. I LOVE TO LOOK AT HER; AND I WILL ADD THIS PRAISE,
THAT I DO NOT THINK HER PERSONALLY VAIN. CONSIDERING HOW VERY HANDSOME
SHE IS, SHE APPEARS TO BE LITTLE OCCUPIED WITH IT; HER VANITY LIES
ANOTHER WAY. MRS. WESTON, I AM NOT TO BE TALKED OUT OF MY DISLIKE OF
HARRIET SMITH, OR MY DREAD OF ITS DOING THEM BOTH HARM."

"AND I, MR. KNIGHTLEY, AM EQUALLY STOUT IN MY CONFIDENCE OF ITS NOT
DOING THEM ANY HARM. WITH ALL DEAR EMMA'S LITTLE FAULTS, SHE IS AN
EXCELLENT CREATURE. WHERE SHALL WE SEE A BETTER DAUGHTER, OR A KINDER
SISTER, OR A TRUER FRIEND? NO, NO; SHE HAS QUALITIES WHICH MAY BE
TRUSTED; SHE WILL NEVER LEAD ANY ONE REALLY WRONG; SHE WILL MAKE NO
LASTING BLUNDER; WHERE EMMA ERRS ONCE, SHE IS IN THE RIGHT A HUNDRED
TIMES."

"VERY WELL; I WILL NOT PLAGUE YOU ANY MORE. EMMA SHALL BE AN ANGEL, AND
I WILL KEEP MY SPLEEN TO MYSELF TILL CHRISTMAS BRINGS JOHN AND ISABELLA.
JOHN LOVES EMMA WITH A REASONABLE AND THEREFORE NOT A BLIND AFFECTION,
AND ISABELLA ALWAYS THINKS AS HE DOES; EXCEPT WHEN HE IS NOT QUITE
FRIGHTENED ENOUGH ABOUT THE CHILDREN. I AM SURE OF HAVING THEIR OPINIONS
WITH ME."

"I KNOW THAT YOU ALL LOVE HER REALLY TOO WELL TO BE UNJUST OR UNKIND;
BUT EXCUSE ME, MR. KNIGHTLEY, IF I TAKE THE LIBERTY (I CONSIDER MYSELF,
YOU KNOW, AS HAVING SOMEWHAT OF THE PRIVILEGE OF SPEECH THAT EMMA'S
MOTHER MIGHT HAVE HAD) THE LIBERTY OF HINTING THAT I DO NOT THINK ANY
POSSIBLE GOOD CAN ARISE FROM HARRIET SMITH'S INTIMACY BEING MADE A
MATTER OF MUCH DISCUSSION AMONG YOU. PRAY EXCUSE ME; BUT SUPPOSING ANY
LITTLE INCONVENIENCE MAY BE APPREHENDED FROM THE INTIMACY, IT CANNOT BE
EXPECTED THAT EMMA, ACCOUNTABLE TO NOBODY BUT HER FATHER, WHO PERFECTLY
APPROVES THE ACQUAINTANCE, SHOULD PUT AN END TO IT, SO LONG AS IT IS A
SOURCE OF PLEASURE TO HERSELF. IT HAS BEEN SO MANY YEARS MY PROVINCE TO
GIVE ADVICE, THAT YOU CANNOT BE SURPRIZED, MR. KNIGHTLEY, AT THIS LITTLE
REMAINS OF OFFICE."

"NOT AT ALL," CRIED HE; "I AM MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU FOR IT. IT IS VERY
GOOD ADVICE, AND IT SHALL HAVE A BETTER FATE THAN YOUR ADVICE HAS OFTEN
FOUND; FOR IT SHALL BE ATTENDED TO."

"MRS. JOHN KNIGHTLEY IS EASILY ALARMED, AND MIGHT BE MADE UNHAPPY ABOUT
HER SISTER."

"BE SATISFIED," SAID HE, "I WILL NOT RAISE ANY OUTCRY. I WILL KEEP MY
ILL-HUMOUR TO MYSELF. I HAVE A VERY SINCERE INTEREST IN EMMA. ISABELLA
DOES NOT SEEM MORE MY SISTER; HAS NEVER EXCITED A GREATER INTEREST;
PERHAPS HARDLY SO GREAT. THERE IS AN ANXIETY, A CURIOSITY IN WHAT ONE
FEELS FOR EMMA. I WONDER WHAT WILL BECOME OF HER!"

"SO DO I," SAID MRS. WESTON GENTLY, "VERY MUCH."

"SHE ALWAYS DECLARES SHE WILL NEVER MARRY, WHICH, OF COURSE, MEANS JUST
NOTHING AT ALL. BUT I HAVE NO IDEA THAT SHE HAS YET EVER SEEN A MAN SHE
CARED FOR. IT WOULD NOT BE A BAD THING FOR HER TO BE VERY MUCH IN LOVE
WITH A PROPER OBJECT. I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE EMMA IN LOVE, AND IN SOME
DOUBT OF A RETURN; IT WOULD DO HER GOOD. BUT THERE IS NOBODY HEREABOUTS
TO ATTACH HER; AND SHE GOES SO SELDOM FROM HOME."

"THERE DOES, INDEED, SEEM AS LITTLE TO TEMPT HER TO BREAK HER RESOLUTION
AT PRESENT," SAID MRS. WESTON, "AS CAN WELL BE; AND WHILE SHE IS SO
HAPPY AT HARTFIELD, I CANNOT WISH HER TO BE FORMING ANY ATTACHMENT WHICH
WOULD BE CREATING SUCH DIFFICULTIES ON POOR MR. WOODHOUSE'S ACCOUNT. I
DO NOT RECOMMEND MATRIMONY AT PRESENT TO EMMA, THOUGH I MEAN NO SLIGHT
TO THE STATE, I ASSURE YOU."

PART OF HER MEANING WAS TO CONCEAL SOME FAVOURITE THOUGHTS OF HER OWN
AND MR. WESTON'S ON THE SUBJECT, AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. THERE WERE WISHES
AT RANDALLS RESPECTING EMMA'S DESTINY, BUT IT WAS NOT DESIRABLE TO
HAVE THEM SUSPECTED; AND THE QUIET TRANSITION WHICH MR. KNIGHTLEY SOON
AFTERWARDS MADE TO "WHAT DOES WESTON THINK OF THE WEATHER; SHALL WE HAVE
RAIN?" CONVINCED HER THAT HE HAD NOTHING MORE TO SAY OR SURMISE ABOUT
HARTFIELD.



CHAPTER VI


EMMA COULD NOT FEEL A DOUBT OF HAVING GIVEN HARRIET'S FANCY A PROPER
DIRECTION AND RAISED THE GRATITUDE OF HER YOUNG VANITY TO A VERY GOOD
PURPOSE, FOR SHE FOUND HER DECIDEDLY MORE SENSIBLE THAN BEFORE OF MR.
ELTON'S BEING A REMARKABLY HANDSOME MAN, WITH MOST AGREEABLE MANNERS;
AND AS SHE HAD NO HESITATION IN FOLLOWING UP THE ASSURANCE OF HIS
ADMIRATION BY AGREEABLE HINTS, SHE WAS SOON PRETTY CONFIDENT OF CREATING
AS MUCH LIKING ON HARRIET'S SIDE, AS THERE COULD BE ANY OCCASION FOR.
SHE WAS QUITE CONVINCED OF MR. ELTON'S BEING IN THE FAIREST WAY OF
FALLING IN LOVE, IF NOT IN LOVE ALREADY. SHE HAD NO SCRUPLE WITH REGARD
TO HIM. HE TALKED OF HARRIET, AND PRAISED HER SO WARMLY, THAT SHE COULD
NOT SUPPOSE ANY THING WANTING WHICH A LITTLE TIME WOULD NOT ADD. HIS
PERCEPTION OF THE STRIKING IMPROVEMENT OF HARRIET'S MANNER, SINCE HER
INTRODUCTION AT HARTFIELD, WAS NOT ONE OF THE LEAST AGREEABLE PROOFS OF
HIS GROWING ATTACHMENT.

"YOU HAVE GIVEN MISS SMITH ALL THAT SHE REQUIRED," SAID HE; "YOU HAVE
MADE HER GRACEFUL AND EASY. SHE WAS A BEAUTIFUL CREATURE WHEN SHE
CAME TO YOU, BUT, IN MY OPINION, THE ATTRACTIONS YOU HAVE ADDED ARE
INFINITELY SUPERIOR TO WHAT SHE RECEIVED FROM NATURE."

"I AM GLAD YOU THINK I HAVE BEEN USEFUL TO HER; BUT HARRIET ONLY WANTED
DRAWING OUT, AND RECEIVING A FEW, VERY FEW HINTS. SHE HAD ALL THE
NATURAL GRACE OF SWEETNESS OF TEMPER AND ARTLESSNESS IN HERSELF. I HAVE
DONE VERY LITTLE."

"IF IT WERE ADMISSIBLE TO CONTRADICT A LADY," SAID THE GALLANT MR.
ELTON--

"I HAVE PERHAPS GIVEN HER A LITTLE MORE DECISION OF CHARACTER, HAVE
TAUGHT HER TO THINK ON POINTS WHICH HAD NOT FALLEN IN HER WAY BEFORE."

"EXACTLY SO; THAT IS WHAT PRINCIPALLY STRIKES ME. SO MUCH SUPERADDED
DECISION OF CHARACTER! SKILFUL HAS BEEN THE HAND!"

"GREAT HAS BEEN THE PLEASURE, I AM SURE. I NEVER MET WITH A DISPOSITION
MORE TRULY AMIABLE."

"I HAVE NO DOUBT OF IT." AND IT WAS SPOKEN WITH A SORT OF SIGHING
ANIMATION, WHICH HAD A VAST DEAL OF THE LOVER. SHE WAS NOT LESS PLEASED
ANOTHER DAY WITH THE MANNER IN WHICH HE SECONDED A SUDDEN WISH OF HERS,
TO HAVE HARRIET'S PICTURE.

"DID YOU EVER HAVE YOUR LIKENESS TAKEN, HARRIET?" SAID SHE: "DID YOU
EVER SIT FOR YOUR PICTURE?"

HARRIET WAS ON THE POINT OF LEAVING THE ROOM, AND ONLY STOPT TO SAY,
WITH A VERY INTERESTING NAIVETE,

"OH! DEAR, NO, NEVER."

NO SOONER WAS SHE OUT OF SIGHT, THAN EMMA EXCLAIMED,

"WHAT AN EXQUISITE POSSESSION A GOOD PICTURE OF HER WOULD BE! I WOULD
GIVE ANY MONEY FOR IT. I ALMOST LONG TO ATTEMPT HER LIKENESS MYSELF.
YOU DO NOT KNOW IT I DARE SAY, BUT TWO OR THREE YEARS AGO I HAD A GREAT
PASSION FOR TAKING LIKENESSES, AND ATTEMPTED SEVERAL OF MY FRIENDS, AND
WAS THOUGHT TO HAVE A TOLERABLE EYE IN GENERAL. BUT FROM ONE CAUSE OR
ANOTHER, I GAVE IT UP IN DISGUST. BUT REALLY, I COULD ALMOST VENTURE,
IF HARRIET WOULD SIT TO ME. IT WOULD BE SUCH A DELIGHT TO HAVE HER
PICTURE!"

"LET ME ENTREAT YOU," CRIED MR. ELTON; "IT WOULD INDEED BE A DELIGHT!
LET ME ENTREAT YOU, MISS WOODHOUSE, TO EXERCISE SO CHARMING A TALENT
IN FAVOUR OF YOUR FRIEND. I KNOW WHAT YOUR DRAWINGS ARE. HOW COULD
YOU SUPPOSE ME IGNORANT? IS NOT THIS ROOM RICH IN SPECIMENS OF YOUR
LANDSCAPES AND FLOWERS; AND HAS NOT MRS. WESTON SOME INIMITABLE
FIGURE-PIECES IN HER DRAWING-ROOM, AT RANDALLS?"

YES, GOOD MAN!--THOUGHT EMMA--BUT WHAT HAS ALL THAT TO DO WITH TAKING
LIKENESSES? YOU KNOW NOTHING OF DRAWING. DON'T PRETEND TO BE IN RAPTURES
ABOUT MINE. KEEP YOUR RAPTURES FOR HARRIET'S FACE. "WELL, IF YOU GIVE ME
SUCH KIND ENCOURAGEMENT, MR. ELTON, I BELIEVE I SHALL TRY WHAT I CAN DO.
HARRIET'S FEATURES ARE VERY DELICATE, WHICH MAKES A LIKENESS DIFFICULT;
AND YET THERE IS A PECULIARITY IN THE SHAPE OF THE EYE AND THE LINES
ABOUT THE MOUTH WHICH ONE OUGHT TO CATCH."

"EXACTLY SO--THE SHAPE OF THE EYE AND THE LINES ABOUT THE MOUTH--I HAVE
NOT A DOUBT OF YOUR SUCCESS. PRAY, PRAY ATTEMPT IT. AS YOU WILL DO IT,
IT WILL INDEED, TO USE YOUR OWN WORDS, BE AN EXQUISITE POSSESSION."

"BUT I AM AFRAID, MR. ELTON, HARRIET WILL NOT LIKE TO SIT. SHE THINKS
SO LITTLE OF HER OWN BEAUTY. DID NOT YOU OBSERVE HER MANNER OF ANSWERING
ME? HOW COMPLETELY IT MEANT, 'WHY SHOULD MY PICTURE BE DRAWN?'"

"OH! YES, I OBSERVED IT, I ASSURE YOU. IT WAS NOT LOST ON ME. BUT STILL
I CANNOT IMAGINE SHE WOULD NOT BE PERSUADED."

HARRIET WAS SOON BACK AGAIN, AND THE PROPOSAL ALMOST IMMEDIATELY MADE;
AND SHE HAD NO SCRUPLES WHICH COULD STAND MANY MINUTES AGAINST THE
EARNEST PRESSING OF BOTH THE OTHERS. EMMA WISHED TO GO TO WORK DIRECTLY,
AND THEREFORE PRODUCED THE PORTFOLIO CONTAINING HER VARIOUS ATTEMPTS AT
PORTRAITS, FOR NOT ONE OF THEM HAD EVER BEEN FINISHED, THAT THEY MIGHT
DECIDE TOGETHER ON THE BEST SIZE FOR HARRIET. HER MANY BEGINNINGS WERE
DISPLAYED. MINIATURES, HALF-LENGTHS, WHOLE-LENGTHS, PENCIL, CRAYON, AND
WATER-COLOURS HAD BEEN ALL TRIED IN TURN. SHE HAD ALWAYS WANTED TO DO
EVERY THING, AND HAD MADE MORE PROGRESS BOTH IN DRAWING AND MUSIC THAN
MANY MIGHT HAVE DONE WITH SO LITTLE LABOUR AS SHE WOULD EVER SUBMIT TO.
SHE PLAYED AND SANG;--AND DREW IN ALMOST EVERY STYLE; BUT STEADINESS
HAD ALWAYS BEEN WANTING; AND IN NOTHING HAD SHE APPROACHED THE DEGREE OF
EXCELLENCE WHICH SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN GLAD TO COMMAND, AND OUGHT NOT TO
HAVE FAILED OF. SHE WAS NOT MUCH DECEIVED AS TO HER OWN SKILL EITHER
AS AN ARTIST OR A MUSICIAN, BUT SHE WAS NOT UNWILLING TO HAVE OTHERS
DECEIVED, OR SORRY TO KNOW HER REPUTATION FOR ACCOMPLISHMENT OFTEN
HIGHER THAN IT DESERVED.

THERE WAS MERIT IN EVERY DRAWING--IN THE LEAST FINISHED, PERHAPS THE
MOST; HER STYLE WAS SPIRITED; BUT HAD THERE BEEN MUCH LESS, OR HAD THERE
BEEN TEN TIMES MORE, THE DELIGHT AND ADMIRATION OF HER TWO COMPANIONS
WOULD HAVE BEEN THE SAME. THEY WERE BOTH IN ECSTASIES. A LIKENESS
PLEASES EVERY BODY; AND MISS WOODHOUSE'S PERFORMANCES MUST BE CAPITAL.

"NO GREAT VARIETY OF FACES FOR YOU," SAID EMMA. "I HAD ONLY MY OWN
FAMILY TO STUDY FROM. THERE IS MY FATHER--ANOTHER OF MY FATHER--BUT THE
IDEA OF SITTING FOR HIS PICTURE MADE HIM SO NERVOUS, THAT I COULD ONLY
TAKE HIM BY STEALTH; NEITHER OF THEM VERY LIKE THEREFORE. MRS. WESTON
AGAIN, AND AGAIN, AND AGAIN, YOU SEE. DEAR MRS. WESTON! ALWAYS MY
KINDEST FRIEND ON EVERY OCCASION. SHE WOULD SIT WHENEVER I ASKED HER.
THERE IS MY SISTER; AND REALLY QUITE HER OWN LITTLE ELEGANT FIGURE!--AND
THE FACE NOT UNLIKE. I SHOULD HAVE MADE A GOOD LIKENESS OF HER, IF SHE
WOULD HAVE SAT LONGER, BUT SHE WAS IN SUCH A HURRY TO HAVE ME DRAW
HER FOUR CHILDREN THAT SHE WOULD NOT BE QUIET. THEN, HERE COME ALL MY
ATTEMPTS AT THREE OF THOSE FOUR CHILDREN;--THERE THEY ARE, HENRY AND
JOHN AND BELLA, FROM ONE END OF THE SHEET TO THE OTHER, AND ANY ONE OF
THEM MIGHT DO FOR ANY ONE OF THE REST. SHE WAS SO EAGER TO HAVE THEM
DRAWN THAT I COULD NOT REFUSE; BUT THERE IS NO MAKING CHILDREN OF THREE
OR FOUR YEARS OLD STAND STILL YOU KNOW; NOR CAN IT BE VERY EASY TO TAKE
ANY LIKENESS OF THEM, BEYOND THE AIR AND COMPLEXION, UNLESS THEY ARE
COARSER FEATURED THAN ANY OF MAMA'S CHILDREN EVER WERE. HERE IS MY
SKETCH OF THE FOURTH, WHO WAS A BABY. I TOOK HIM AS HE WAS SLEEPING ON
THE SOFA, AND IT IS AS STRONG A LIKENESS OF HIS COCKADE AS YOU WOULD
WISH TO SEE. HE HAD NESTLED DOWN HIS HEAD MOST CONVENIENTLY. THAT'S VERY
LIKE. I AM RATHER PROUD OF LITTLE GEORGE. THE CORNER OF THE SOFA IS VERY
GOOD. THEN HERE IS MY LAST,"--UNCLOSING A PRETTY SKETCH OF A GENTLEMAN
IN SMALL SIZE, WHOLE-LENGTH--"MY LAST AND MY BEST--MY BROTHER, MR. JOHN
KNIGHTLEY.--THIS DID NOT WANT MUCH OF BEING FINISHED, WHEN I PUT IT AWAY
IN A PET, AND VOWED I WOULD NEVER TAKE ANOTHER LIKENESS. I COULD NOT
HELP BEING PROVOKED; FOR AFTER ALL MY PAINS, AND WHEN I HAD REALLY MADE
A VERY GOOD LIKENESS OF IT--(MRS. WESTON AND I WERE QUITE AGREED IN
THINKING IT VERY LIKE)--ONLY TOO HANDSOME--TOO FLATTERING--BUT
THAT WAS A FAULT ON THE RIGHT SIDE"--AFTER ALL THIS, CAME POOR DEAR
ISABELLA'S COLD APPROBATION OF--"YES, IT WAS A LITTLE LIKE--BUT TO BE
SURE IT DID NOT DO HIM JUSTICE. WE HAD HAD A GREAT DEAL OF TROUBLE
IN PERSUADING HIM TO SIT AT ALL. IT WAS MADE A GREAT FAVOUR OF; AND
ALTOGETHER IT WAS MORE THAN I COULD BEAR; AND SO I NEVER WOULD FINISH
IT, TO HAVE IT APOLOGISED OVER AS AN UNFAVOURABLE LIKENESS, TO EVERY
MORNING VISITOR IN BRUNSWICK SQUARE;--AND, AS I SAID, I DID THEN
FORSWEAR EVER DRAWING ANY BODY AGAIN. BUT FOR HARRIET'S SAKE, OR RATHER
FOR MY OWN, AND AS THERE ARE NO HUSBANDS AND WIVES IN THE CASE AT
PRESENT, I WILL BREAK MY RESOLUTION NOW."

MR. ELTON SEEMED VERY PROPERLY STRUCK AND DELIGHTED BY THE IDEA, AND WAS
REPEATING, "NO HUSBANDS AND WIVES IN THE CASE AT PRESENT INDEED, AS
YOU OBSERVE. EXACTLY SO. NO HUSBANDS AND WIVES," WITH SO INTERESTING A
CONSCIOUSNESS, THAT EMMA BEGAN TO CONSIDER WHETHER SHE HAD NOT BETTER
LEAVE THEM TOGETHER AT ONCE. BUT AS SHE WANTED TO BE DRAWING, THE
DECLARATION MUST WAIT A LITTLE LONGER.

SHE HAD SOON FIXED ON THE SIZE AND SORT OF PORTRAIT. IT WAS TO BE
A WHOLE-LENGTH IN WATER-COLOURS, LIKE MR. JOHN KNIGHTLEY'S, AND WAS
DESTINED, IF SHE COULD PLEASE HERSELF, TO HOLD A VERY HONOURABLE STATION
OVER THE MANTELPIECE.

THE SITTING BEGAN; AND HARRIET, SMILING AND BLUSHING, AND AFRAID OF NOT
KEEPING HER ATTITUDE AND COUNTENANCE, PRESENTED A VERY SWEET MIXTURE OF
YOUTHFUL EXPRESSION TO THE STEADY EYES OF THE ARTIST. BUT THERE WAS NO
DOING ANY THING, WITH MR. ELTON FIDGETING BEHIND HER AND WATCHING EVERY
TOUCH. SHE GAVE HIM CREDIT FOR STATIONING HIMSELF WHERE HE MIGHT GAZE
AND GAZE AGAIN WITHOUT OFFENCE; BUT WAS REALLY OBLIGED TO PUT AN END TO
IT, AND REQUEST HIM TO PLACE HIMSELF ELSEWHERE. IT THEN OCCURRED TO HER
TO EMPLOY HIM IN READING.

"IF HE WOULD BE SO GOOD AS TO READ TO THEM, IT WOULD BE A KINDNESS
INDEED! IT WOULD AMUSE AWAY THE DIFFICULTIES OF HER PART, AND LESSEN THE
IRKSOMENESS OF MISS SMITH'S."

MR. ELTON WAS ONLY TOO HAPPY. HARRIET LISTENED, AND EMMA DREW IN PEACE.
SHE MUST ALLOW HIM TO BE STILL FREQUENTLY COMING TO LOOK; ANY THING LESS
WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN TOO LITTLE IN A LOVER; AND HE WAS READY AT THE
SMALLEST INTERMISSION OF THE PENCIL, TO JUMP UP AND SEE THE PROGRESS,
AND BE CHARMED.--THERE WAS NO BEING DISPLEASED WITH SUCH AN ENCOURAGER,
FOR HIS ADMIRATION MADE HIM DISCERN A LIKENESS ALMOST BEFORE IT
WAS POSSIBLE. SHE COULD NOT RESPECT HIS EYE, BUT HIS LOVE AND HIS
COMPLAISANCE WERE UNEXCEPTIONABLE.

THE SITTING WAS ALTOGETHER VERY SATISFACTORY; SHE WAS QUITE ENOUGH
PLEASED WITH THE FIRST DAY'S SKETCH TO WISH TO GO ON. THERE WAS NO WANT
OF LIKENESS, SHE HAD BEEN FORTUNATE IN THE ATTITUDE, AND AS SHE MEANT
TO THROW IN A LITTLE IMPROVEMENT TO THE FIGURE, TO GIVE A LITTLE MORE
HEIGHT, AND CONSIDERABLY MORE ELEGANCE, SHE HAD GREAT CONFIDENCE OF
ITS BEING IN EVERY WAY A PRETTY DRAWING AT LAST, AND OF ITS FILLING
ITS DESTINED PLACE WITH CREDIT TO THEM BOTH--A STANDING MEMORIAL OF THE
BEAUTY OF ONE, THE SKILL OF THE OTHER, AND THE FRIENDSHIP OF BOTH;
WITH AS MANY OTHER AGREEABLE ASSOCIATIONS AS MR. ELTON'S VERY PROMISING
ATTACHMENT WAS LIKELY TO ADD.

HARRIET WAS TO SIT AGAIN THE NEXT DAY; AND MR. ELTON, JUST AS HE OUGHT,
ENTREATED FOR THE PERMISSION OF ATTENDING AND READING TO THEM AGAIN.

"BY ALL MEANS. WE SHALL BE MOST HAPPY TO CONSIDER YOU AS ONE OF THE
PARTY."

THE SAME CIVILITIES AND COURTESIES, THE SAME SUCCESS AND SATISFACTION,
TOOK PLACE ON THE MORROW, AND ACCOMPANIED THE WHOLE PROGRESS OF THE
PICTURE, WHICH WAS RAPID AND HAPPY. EVERY BODY WHO SAW IT WAS PLEASED,
BUT MR. ELTON WAS IN CONTINUAL RAPTURES, AND DEFENDED IT THROUGH EVERY
CRITICISM.

"MISS WOODHOUSE HAS GIVEN HER FRIEND THE ONLY BEAUTY SHE
WANTED,"--OBSERVED MRS. WESTON TO HIM--NOT IN THE LEAST SUSPECTING THAT
SHE WAS ADDRESSING A LOVER.--"THE EXPRESSION OF THE EYE IS MOST CORRECT,
BUT MISS SMITH HAS NOT THOSE EYEBROWS AND EYELASHES. IT IS THE FAULT OF
HER FACE THAT SHE HAS THEM NOT."

"DO YOU THINK SO?" REPLIED HE. "I CANNOT AGREE WITH YOU. IT APPEARS
TO ME A MOST PERFECT RESEMBLANCE IN EVERY FEATURE. I NEVER SAW SUCH A
LIKENESS IN MY LIFE. WE MUST ALLOW FOR THE EFFECT OF SHADE, YOU KNOW."

"YOU HAVE MADE HER TOO TALL, EMMA," SAID MR. KNIGHTLEY.

EMMA KNEW THAT SHE HAD, BUT WOULD NOT OWN IT; AND MR. ELTON WARMLY
ADDED,

"OH NO! CERTAINLY NOT TOO TALL; NOT IN THE LEAST TOO TALL. CONSIDER, SHE
IS SITTING DOWN--WHICH NATURALLY PRESENTS A DIFFERENT--WHICH IN SHORT
GIVES EXACTLY THE IDEA--AND THE PROPORTIONS MUST BE PRESERVED, YOU KNOW.
PROPORTIONS, FORE-SHORTENING.--OH NO! IT GIVES ONE EXACTLY THE IDEA OF
SUCH A HEIGHT AS MISS SMITH'S. EXACTLY SO INDEED!"

"IT IS VERY PRETTY," SAID MR. WOODHOUSE. "SO PRETTILY DONE! JUST AS YOUR
DRAWINGS ALWAYS ARE, MY DEAR. I DO NOT KNOW ANY BODY WHO DRAWS SO WELL
AS YOU DO. THE ONLY THING I DO NOT THOROUGHLY LIKE IS, THAT SHE SEEMS
TO BE SITTING OUT OF DOORS, WITH ONLY A LITTLE SHAWL OVER HER
SHOULDERS--AND IT MAKES ONE THINK SHE MUST CATCH COLD."

"BUT, MY DEAR PAPA, IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE SUMMER; A WARM DAY IN SUMMER.
LOOK AT THE TREE."

"BUT IT IS NEVER SAFE TO SIT OUT OF DOORS, MY DEAR."

"YOU, SIR, MAY SAY ANY THING," CRIED MR. ELTON, "BUT I MUST CONFESS THAT
I REGARD IT AS A MOST HAPPY THOUGHT, THE PLACING OF MISS SMITH OUT OF
DOORS; AND THE TREE IS TOUCHED WITH SUCH INIMITABLE SPIRIT! ANY OTHER
SITUATION WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH LESS IN CHARACTER. THE NAIVETE OF MISS
SMITH'S MANNERS--AND ALTOGETHER--OH, IT IS MOST ADMIRABLE! I CANNOT KEEP
MY EYES FROM IT. I NEVER SAW SUCH A LIKENESS."

THE NEXT THING WANTED WAS TO GET THE PICTURE FRAMED; AND HERE WERE A FEW
DIFFICULTIES. IT MUST BE DONE DIRECTLY; IT MUST BE DONE IN LONDON; THE
ORDER MUST GO THROUGH THE HANDS OF SOME INTELLIGENT PERSON WHOSE TASTE
COULD BE DEPENDED ON; AND ISABELLA, THE USUAL DOER OF ALL COMMISSIONS,
MUST NOT BE APPLIED TO, BECAUSE IT WAS DECEMBER, AND MR. WOODHOUSE
COULD NOT BEAR THE IDEA OF HER STIRRING OUT OF HER HOUSE IN THE FOGS OF
DECEMBER. BUT NO SOONER WAS THE DISTRESS KNOWN TO MR. ELTON, THAN IT
WAS REMOVED. HIS GALLANTRY WAS ALWAYS ON THE ALERT. "MIGHT HE BE TRUSTED
WITH THE COMMISSION, WHAT INFINITE PLEASURE SHOULD HE HAVE IN EXECUTING
IT! HE COULD RIDE TO LONDON AT ANY TIME. IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY HOW
MUCH HE SHOULD BE GRATIFIED BY BEING EMPLOYED ON SUCH AN ERRAND."

"HE WAS TOO GOOD!--SHE COULD NOT ENDURE THE THOUGHT!--SHE WOULD NOT GIVE
HIM SUCH A TROUBLESOME OFFICE FOR THE WORLD,"--BROUGHT ON THE DESIRED
REPETITION OF ENTREATIES AND ASSURANCES,--AND A VERY FEW MINUTES SETTLED
THE BUSINESS.

MR. ELTON WAS TO TAKE THE DRAWING TO LONDON, CHUSE THE FRAME, AND GIVE
THE DIRECTIONS; AND EMMA THOUGHT SHE COULD SO PACK IT AS TO ENSURE ITS
SAFETY WITHOUT MUCH INCOMMODING HIM, WHILE HE SEEMED MOSTLY FEARFUL OF
NOT BEING INCOMMODED ENOUGH.

"WHAT A PRECIOUS DEPOSIT!" SAID HE WITH A TENDER SIGH, AS HE RECEIVED
IT.

"THIS MAN IS ALMOST TOO GALLANT TO BE IN LOVE," THOUGHT EMMA. "I SHOULD
SAY SO, BUT THAT I SUPPOSE THERE MAY BE A HUNDRED DIFFERENT WAYS OF
BEING IN LOVE. HE IS AN EXCELLENT YOUNG MAN, AND WILL SUIT HARRIET
EXACTLY; IT WILL BE AN 'EXACTLY SO,' AS HE SAYS HIMSELF; BUT HE DOES
SIGH AND LANGUISH, AND STUDY FOR COMPLIMENTS RATHER MORE THAN I COULD
ENDURE AS A PRINCIPAL. I COME IN FOR A PRETTY GOOD SHARE AS A SECOND.
BUT IT IS HIS GRATITUDE ON HARRIET'S ACCOUNT."



CHAPTER VII


THE VERY DAY OF MR. ELTON'S GOING TO LONDON PRODUCED A FRESH OCCASION
FOR EMMA'S SERVICES TOWARDS HER FRIEND. HARRIET HAD BEEN AT HARTFIELD,
AS USUAL, SOON AFTER BREAKFAST; AND, AFTER A TIME, HAD GONE HOME TO
RETURN AGAIN TO DINNER: SHE RETURNED, AND SOONER THAN HAD BEEN
TALKED OF, AND WITH AN AGITATED, HURRIED LOOK, ANNOUNCING SOMETHING
EXTRAORDINARY TO HAVE HAPPENED WHICH SHE WAS LONGING TO TELL. HALF A
MINUTE BROUGHT IT ALL OUT. SHE HAD HEARD, AS SOON AS SHE GOT BACK TO
MRS. GODDARD'S, THAT MR. MARTIN HAD BEEN THERE AN HOUR BEFORE, AND
FINDING SHE WAS NOT AT HOME, NOR PARTICULARLY EXPECTED, HAD LEFT A
LITTLE PARCEL FOR HER FROM ONE OF HIS SISTERS, AND GONE AWAY; AND ON
OPENING THIS PARCEL, SHE HAD ACTUALLY FOUND, BESIDES THE TWO SONGS WHICH
SHE HAD LENT ELIZABETH TO COPY, A LETTER TO HERSELF; AND THIS LETTER WAS
FROM HIM, FROM MR. MARTIN, AND CONTAINED A DIRECT PROPOSAL OF MARRIAGE.
"WHO COULD HAVE THOUGHT IT? SHE WAS SO SURPRIZED SHE DID NOT KNOW WHAT
TO DO. YES, QUITE A PROPOSAL OF MARRIAGE; AND A VERY GOOD LETTER,
AT LEAST SHE THOUGHT SO. AND HE WROTE AS IF HE REALLY LOVED HER VERY
MUCH--BUT SHE DID NOT KNOW--AND SO, SHE WAS COME AS FAST AS SHE COULD TO
ASK MISS WOODHOUSE WHAT SHE SHOULD DO.--" EMMA WAS HALF-ASHAMED OF HER
FRIEND FOR SEEMING SO PLEASED AND SO DOUBTFUL.

"UPON MY WORD," SHE CRIED, "THE YOUNG MAN IS DETERMINED NOT TO LOSE ANY
THING FOR WANT OF ASKING. HE WILL CONNECT HIMSELF WELL IF HE CAN."

"WILL YOU READ THE LETTER?" CRIED HARRIET. "PRAY DO. I'D RATHER YOU
WOULD."

EMMA WAS NOT SORRY TO BE PRESSED. SHE READ, AND WAS SURPRIZED. THE STYLE
OF THE LETTER WAS MUCH ABOVE HER EXPECTATION. THERE WERE NOT MERELY NO
GRAMMATICAL ERRORS, BUT AS A COMPOSITION IT WOULD NOT HAVE DISGRACED A
GENTLEMAN; THE LANGUAGE, THOUGH PLAIN, WAS STRONG AND UNAFFECTED, AND
THE SENTIMENTS IT CONVEYED VERY MUCH TO THE CREDIT OF THE WRITER. IT WAS
SHORT, BUT EXPRESSED GOOD SENSE, WARM ATTACHMENT, LIBERALITY, PROPRIETY,
EVEN DELICACY OF FEELING. SHE PAUSED OVER IT, WHILE HARRIET STOOD
ANXIOUSLY WATCHING FOR HER OPINION, WITH A "WELL, WELL," AND WAS AT LAST
FORCED TO ADD, "IS IT A GOOD LETTER? OR IS IT TOO SHORT?"

"YES, INDEED, A VERY GOOD LETTER," REPLIED EMMA RATHER SLOWLY--"SO
GOOD A LETTER, HARRIET, THAT EVERY THING CONSIDERED, I THINK ONE OF HIS
SISTERS MUST HAVE HELPED HIM. I CAN HARDLY IMAGINE THE YOUNG MAN WHOM
I SAW TALKING WITH YOU THE OTHER DAY COULD EXPRESS HIMSELF SO WELL, IF
LEFT QUITE TO HIS OWN POWERS, AND YET IT IS NOT THE STYLE OF A WOMAN;
NO, CERTAINLY, IT IS TOO STRONG AND CONCISE; NOT DIFFUSE ENOUGH FOR A
WOMAN. NO DOUBT HE IS A SENSIBLE MAN, AND I SUPPOSE MAY HAVE A NATURAL
TALENT FOR--THINKS STRONGLY AND CLEARLY--AND WHEN HE TAKES A PEN IN
HAND, HIS THOUGHTS NATURALLY FIND PROPER WORDS. IT IS SO WITH SOME MEN.
YES, I UNDERSTAND THE SORT OF MIND. VIGOROUS, DECIDED, WITH SENTIMENTS
TO A CERTAIN POINT, NOT COARSE. A BETTER WRITTEN LETTER, HARRIET
(RETURNING IT,) THAN I HAD EXPECTED."

"WELL," SAID THE STILL WAITING HARRIET;--"WELL--AND--AND WHAT SHALL I
DO?"

"WHAT SHALL YOU DO! IN WHAT RESPECT? DO YOU MEAN WITH REGARD TO THIS
LETTER?"

"YES."

"BUT WHAT ARE YOU IN DOUBT OF? YOU MUST ANSWER IT OF COURSE--AND
SPEEDILY."

"YES. BUT WHAT SHALL I SAY? DEAR MISS WOODHOUSE, DO ADVISE ME."

"OH NO, NO! THE LETTER HAD MUCH BETTER BE ALL YOUR OWN. YOU WILL EXPRESS
YOURSELF VERY PROPERLY, I AM SURE. THERE IS NO DANGER OF YOUR NOT
BEING INTELLIGIBLE, WHICH IS THE FIRST THING. YOUR MEANING MUST BE
UNEQUIVOCAL; NO DOUBTS OR DEMURS: AND SUCH EXPRESSIONS OF GRATITUDE
AND CONCERN FOR THE PAIN YOU ARE INFLICTING AS PROPRIETY REQUIRES, WILL
PRESENT THEMSELVES UNBIDDEN TO YOUR MIND, I AM PERSUADED. YOU NEED
NOT BE PROMPTED TO WRITE WITH THE APPEARANCE OF SORROW FOR HIS
DISAPPOINTMENT."

"YOU THINK I OUGHT TO REFUSE HIM THEN," SAID HARRIET, LOOKING DOWN.

"OUGHT TO REFUSE HIM! MY DEAR HARRIET, WHAT DO YOU MEAN? ARE YOU IN ANY
DOUBT AS TO THAT? I THOUGHT--BUT I BEG YOUR PARDON, PERHAPS I HAVE BEEN
UNDER A MISTAKE. I CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN MISUNDERSTANDING YOU, IF YOU FEEL
IN DOUBT AS TO THE PURPORT OF YOUR ANSWER. I HAD IMAGINED YOU WERE
CONSULTING ME ONLY AS TO THE WORDING OF IT."

HARRIET WAS SILENT. WITH A LITTLE RESERVE OF MANNER, EMMA CONTINUED:

"YOU MEAN TO RETURN A FAVOURABLE ANSWER, I COLLECT."

"NO, I DO NOT; THAT IS, I DO NOT MEAN--WHAT SHALL I DO? WHAT WOULD YOU
ADVISE ME TO DO? PRAY, DEAR MISS WOODHOUSE, TELL ME WHAT I OUGHT TO DO."

"I SHALL NOT GIVE YOU ANY ADVICE, HARRIET. I WILL HAVE NOTHING TO DO
WITH IT. THIS IS A POINT WHICH YOU MUST SETTLE WITH YOUR FEELINGS."

"I HAD NO NOTION THAT HE LIKED ME SO VERY MUCH," SAID HARRIET,
CONTEMPLATING THE LETTER. FOR A LITTLE WHILE EMMA PERSEVERED IN HER
SILENCE; BUT BEGINNING TO APPREHEND THE BEWITCHING FLATTERY OF THAT
LETTER MIGHT BE TOO POWERFUL, SHE THOUGHT IT BEST TO SAY,

"I LAY IT DOWN AS A GENERAL RULE, HARRIET, THAT IF A WOMAN DOUBTS AS
TO WHETHER SHE SHOULD ACCEPT A MAN OR NOT, SHE CERTAINLY OUGHT TO REFUSE
HIM. IF SHE CAN HESITATE AS TO 'YES,' SHE OUGHT TO SAY 'NO' DIRECTLY.
IT IS NOT A STATE TO BE SAFELY ENTERED INTO WITH DOUBTFUL FEELINGS, WITH
HALF A HEART. I THOUGHT IT MY DUTY AS A FRIEND, AND OLDER THAN YOURSELF,
TO SAY THUS MUCH TO YOU. BUT DO NOT IMAGINE THAT I WANT TO INFLUENCE
YOU."

"OH! NO, I AM SURE YOU ARE A GREAT DEAL TOO KIND TO--BUT IF YOU WOULD
JUST ADVISE ME WHAT I HAD BEST DO--NO, NO, I DO NOT MEAN THAT--AS
YOU SAY, ONE'S MIND OUGHT TO BE QUITE MADE UP--ONE SHOULD NOT BE
HESITATING--IT IS A VERY SERIOUS THING.--IT WILL BE SAFER TO SAY 'NO,'
PERHAPS.--DO YOU THINK I HAD BETTER SAY 'NO?'"

"NOT FOR THE WORLD," SAID EMMA, SMILING GRACIOUSLY, "WOULD I ADVISE YOU
EITHER WAY. YOU MUST BE THE BEST JUDGE OF YOUR OWN HAPPINESS. IF YOU
PREFER MR. MARTIN TO EVERY OTHER PERSON; IF YOU THINK HIM THE MOST
AGREEABLE MAN YOU HAVE EVER BEEN IN COMPANY WITH, WHY SHOULD YOU
HESITATE? YOU BLUSH, HARRIET.--DOES ANY BODY ELSE OCCUR TO YOU AT
THIS MOMENT UNDER SUCH A DEFINITION? HARRIET, HARRIET, DO NOT DECEIVE
YOURSELF; DO NOT BE RUN AWAY WITH BY GRATITUDE AND COMPASSION. AT THIS
MOMENT WHOM ARE YOU THINKING OF?"

THE SYMPTOMS WERE FAVOURABLE.--INSTEAD OF ANSWERING, HARRIET TURNED AWAY
CONFUSED, AND STOOD THOUGHTFULLY BY THE FIRE; AND THOUGH THE LETTER WAS
STILL IN HER HAND, IT WAS NOW MECHANICALLY TWISTED ABOUT WITHOUT REGARD.
EMMA WAITED THE RESULT WITH IMPATIENCE, BUT NOT WITHOUT STRONG HOPES. AT
LAST, WITH SOME HESITATION, HARRIET SAID--

"MISS WOODHOUSE, AS YOU WILL NOT GIVE ME YOUR OPINION, I MUST DO AS WELL
AS I CAN BY MYSELF; AND I HAVE NOW QUITE DETERMINED, AND REALLY ALMOST
MADE UP MY MIND--TO REFUSE MR. MARTIN. DO YOU THINK I AM RIGHT?"

"PERFECTLY, PERFECTLY RIGHT, MY DEAREST HARRIET; YOU ARE DOING JUST
WHAT YOU OUGHT. WHILE YOU WERE AT ALL IN SUSPENSE I KEPT MY FEELINGS TO
MYSELF, BUT NOW THAT YOU ARE SO COMPLETELY DECIDED I HAVE NO HESITATION
IN APPROVING. DEAR HARRIET, I GIVE MYSELF JOY OF THIS. IT WOULD
HAVE GRIEVED ME TO LOSE YOUR ACQUAINTANCE, WHICH MUST HAVE BEEN THE
CONSEQUENCE OF YOUR MARRYING MR. MARTIN. WHILE YOU WERE IN THE SMALLEST
DEGREE WAVERING, I SAID NOTHING ABOUT IT, BECAUSE I WOULD NOT INFLUENCE;
BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE LOSS OF A FRIEND TO ME. I COULD NOT HAVE
VISITED MRS. ROBERT MARTIN, OF ABBEY-MILL FARM. NOW I AM SECURE OF YOU
FOR EVER."

HARRIET HAD NOT SURMISED HER OWN DANGER, BUT THE IDEA OF IT STRUCK HER
FORCIBLY.

"YOU COULD NOT HAVE VISITED ME!" SHE CRIED, LOOKING AGHAST. "NO, TO BE
SURE YOU COULD NOT; BUT I NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT BEFORE. THAT WOULD HAVE
BEEN TOO DREADFUL!--WHAT AN ESCAPE!--DEAR MISS WOODHOUSE, I WOULD NOT
GIVE UP THE PLEASURE AND HONOUR OF BEING INTIMATE WITH YOU FOR ANY THING
IN THE WORLD."

"INDEED, HARRIET, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A SEVERE PANG TO LOSE YOU; BUT IT
MUST HAVE BEEN. YOU WOULD HAVE THROWN YOURSELF OUT OF ALL GOOD SOCIETY.
I MUST HAVE GIVEN YOU UP."

"DEAR ME!--HOW SHOULD I EVER HAVE BORNE IT! IT WOULD HAVE KILLED ME
NEVER TO COME TO HARTFIELD ANY MORE!"

"DEAR AFFECTIONATE CREATURE!--YOU BANISHED TO ABBEY-MILL FARM!--YOU
CONFINED TO THE SOCIETY OF THE ILLITERATE AND VULGAR ALL YOUR LIFE! I
WONDER HOW THE YOUNG MAN COULD HAVE THE ASSURANCE TO ASK IT. HE MUST
HAVE A PRETTY GOOD OPINION OF HIMSELF."

"I DO NOT THINK HE IS CONCEITED EITHER, IN GENERAL," SAID HARRIET, HER
CONSCIENCE OPPOSING SUCH CENSURE; "AT LEAST, HE IS VERY GOOD NATURED,
AND I SHALL ALWAYS FEEL MUCH OBLIGED TO HIM, AND HAVE A GREAT REGARD
FOR--BUT THAT IS QUITE A DIFFERENT THING FROM--AND YOU KNOW, THOUGH
HE MAY LIKE ME, IT DOES NOT FOLLOW THAT I SHOULD--AND CERTAINLY I MUST
CONFESS THAT SINCE MY VISITING HERE I HAVE SEEN PEOPLE--AND IF ONE COMES
TO COMPARE THEM, PERSON AND MANNERS, THERE IS NO COMPARISON AT ALL,
ONE IS SO VERY HANDSOME AND AGREEABLE. HOWEVER, I DO REALLY THINK MR.
MARTIN A VERY AMIABLE YOUNG MAN, AND HAVE A GREAT OPINION OF HIM; AND
HIS BEING SO MUCH ATTACHED TO ME--AND HIS WRITING SUCH A LETTER--BUT AS
TO LEAVING YOU, IT IS WHAT I WOULD NOT DO UPON ANY CONSIDERATION."

"THANK YOU, THANK YOU, MY OWN SWEET LITTLE FRIEND. WE WILL NOT BE
PARTED. A WOMAN IS NOT TO MARRY A MAN MERELY BECAUSE SHE IS ASKED, OR
BECAUSE HE IS ATTACHED TO HER, AND CAN WRITE A TOLERABLE LETTER."

"OH NO;--AND IT IS BUT A SHORT LETTER TOO."

EMMA FELT THE BAD TASTE OF HER FRIEND, BUT LET IT PASS WITH A "VERY
TRUE; AND IT WOULD BE A SMALL CONSOLATION TO HER, FOR THE CLOWNISH
MANNER WHICH MIGHT BE OFFENDING HER EVERY HOUR OF THE DAY, TO KNOW THAT
HER HUSBAND COULD WRITE A GOOD LETTER."

"OH! YES, VERY. NOBODY CARES FOR A LETTER; THE THING IS, TO BE ALWAYS
HAPPY WITH PLEASANT COMPANIONS. I AM QUITE DETERMINED TO REFUSE HIM. BUT
HOW SHALL I DO? WHAT SHALL I SAY?"

EMMA ASSURED HER THERE WOULD BE NO DIFFICULTY IN THE ANSWER, AND ADVISED
ITS BEING WRITTEN DIRECTLY, WHICH WAS AGREED TO, IN THE HOPE OF HER
ASSISTANCE; AND THOUGH EMMA CONTINUED TO PROTEST AGAINST ANY ASSISTANCE
BEING WANTED, IT WAS IN FACT GIVEN IN THE FORMATION OF EVERY SENTENCE.
THE LOOKING OVER HIS LETTER AGAIN, IN REPLYING TO IT, HAD SUCH A
SOFTENING TENDENCY, THAT IT WAS PARTICULARLY NECESSARY TO BRACE HER UP
WITH A FEW DECISIVE EXPRESSIONS; AND SHE WAS SO VERY MUCH CONCERNED AT
THE IDEA OF MAKING HIM UNHAPPY, AND THOUGHT SO MUCH OF WHAT HIS MOTHER
AND SISTERS WOULD THINK AND SAY, AND WAS SO ANXIOUS THAT THEY SHOULD NOT
FANCY HER UNGRATEFUL, THAT EMMA BELIEVED IF THE YOUNG MAN HAD COME IN
HER WAY AT THAT MOMENT, HE WOULD HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED AFTER ALL.

THIS LETTER, HOWEVER, WAS WRITTEN, AND SEALED, AND SENT. THE BUSINESS
WAS FINISHED, AND HARRIET SAFE. SHE WAS RATHER LOW ALL THE EVENING, BUT
EMMA COULD ALLOW FOR HER AMIABLE REGRETS, AND SOMETIMES RELIEVED THEM BY
SPEAKING OF HER OWN AFFECTION, SOMETIMES BY BRINGING FORWARD THE IDEA OF
MR. ELTON.

"I SHALL NEVER BE INVITED TO ABBEY-MILL AGAIN," WAS SAID IN RATHER A
SORROWFUL TONE.

"NOR, IF YOU WERE, COULD I EVER BEAR TO PART WITH YOU, MY HARRIET. YOU
ARE A GREAT DEAL TOO NECESSARY AT HARTFIELD TO BE SPARED TO ABBEY-MILL."

"AND I AM SURE I SHOULD NEVER WANT TO GO THERE; FOR I AM NEVER HAPPY BUT
AT HARTFIELD."

SOME TIME AFTERWARDS IT WAS, "I THINK MRS. GODDARD WOULD BE VERY MUCH
SURPRIZED IF SHE KNEW WHAT HAD HAPPENED. I AM SURE MISS NASH WOULD--FOR
MISS NASH THINKS HER OWN SISTER VERY WELL MARRIED, AND IT IS ONLY A
LINEN-DRAPER."

"ONE SHOULD BE SORRY TO SEE GREATER PRIDE OR REFINEMENT IN THE TEACHER
OF A SCHOOL, HARRIET. I DARE SAY MISS NASH WOULD ENVY YOU SUCH AN
OPPORTUNITY AS THIS OF BEING MARRIED. EVEN THIS CONQUEST WOULD APPEAR
VALUABLE IN HER EYES. AS TO ANY THING SUPERIOR FOR YOU, I SUPPOSE SHE
IS QUITE IN THE DARK. THE ATTENTIONS OF A CERTAIN PERSON CAN HARDLY BE
AMONG THE TITTLE-TATTLE OF HIGHBURY YET. HITHERTO I FANCY YOU AND I
ARE THE ONLY PEOPLE TO WHOM HIS LOOKS AND MANNERS HAVE EXPLAINED
THEMSELVES."

HARRIET BLUSHED AND SMILED, AND SAID SOMETHING ABOUT WONDERING THAT
PEOPLE SHOULD LIKE HER SO MUCH. THE IDEA OF MR. ELTON WAS CERTAINLY
CHEERING; BUT STILL, AFTER A TIME, SHE WAS TENDER-HEARTED AGAIN TOWARDS
THE REJECTED MR. MARTIN.

"NOW HE HAS GOT MY LETTER," SAID SHE SOFTLY. "I WONDER WHAT THEY ARE ALL
DOING--WHETHER HIS SISTERS KNOW--IF HE IS UNHAPPY, THEY WILL BE UNHAPPY
TOO. I HOPE HE WILL NOT MIND IT SO VERY MUCH."

"LET US THINK OF THOSE AMONG OUR ABSENT FRIENDS WHO ARE MORE CHEERFULLY
EMPLOYED," CRIED EMMA. "AT THIS MOMENT, PERHAPS, MR. ELTON IS SHEWING
YOUR PICTURE TO HIS MOTHER AND SISTERS, TELLING HOW MUCH MORE BEAUTIFUL
IS THE ORIGINAL, AND AFTER BEING ASKED FOR IT FIVE OR SIX TIMES,
ALLOWING THEM TO HEAR YOUR NAME, YOUR OWN DEAR NAME."

"MY PICTURE!--BUT HE HAS LEFT MY PICTURE IN BOND-STREET."

"HAS HE SO!--THEN I KNOW NOTHING OF MR. ELTON. NO, MY DEAR LITTLE MODEST
HARRIET, DEPEND UPON IT THE PICTURE WILL NOT BE IN BOND-STREET TILL
JUST BEFORE HE MOUNTS HIS HORSE TO-MORROW. IT IS HIS COMPANION ALL THIS
EVENING, HIS SOLACE, HIS DELIGHT. IT OPENS HIS DESIGNS TO HIS FAMILY,
IT INTRODUCES YOU AMONG THEM, IT DIFFUSES THROUGH THE PARTY THOSE
PLEASANTEST FEELINGS OF OUR NATURE, EAGER CURIOSITY AND WARM
PREPOSSESSION. HOW CHEERFUL, HOW ANIMATED, HOW SUSPICIOUS, HOW BUSY
THEIR IMAGINATIONS ALL ARE!"

HARRIET SMILED AGAIN, AND HER SMILES GREW STRONGER.



CHAPTER VIII


HARRIET SLEPT AT HARTFIELD THAT NIGHT. FOR SOME WEEKS PAST SHE HAD BEEN
SPENDING MORE THAN HALF HER TIME THERE, AND GRADUALLY GETTING TO HAVE
A BED-ROOM APPROPRIATED TO HERSELF; AND EMMA JUDGED IT BEST IN EVERY
RESPECT, SAFEST AND KINDEST, TO KEEP HER WITH THEM AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE
JUST AT PRESENT. SHE WAS OBLIGED TO GO THE NEXT MORNING FOR AN HOUR OR
TWO TO MRS. GODDARD'S, BUT IT WAS THEN TO BE SETTLED THAT SHE SHOULD
RETURN TO HARTFIELD, TO MAKE A REGULAR VISIT OF SOME DAYS.

WHILE SHE WAS GONE, MR. KNIGHTLEY CALLED, AND SAT SOME TIME WITH MR.
WOODHOUSE AND EMMA, TILL MR. WOODHOUSE, WHO HAD PREVIOUSLY MADE UP HIS
MIND TO WALK OUT, WAS PERSUADED BY HIS DAUGHTER NOT TO DEFER IT, AND WAS
INDUCED BY THE ENTREATIES OF BOTH, THOUGH AGAINST THE SCRUPLES OF HIS
OWN CIVILITY, TO LEAVE MR. KNIGHTLEY FOR THAT PURPOSE. MR. KNIGHTLEY,
WHO HAD NOTHING OF CEREMONY ABOUT HIM, WAS OFFERING BY HIS SHORT,
DECIDED ANSWERS, AN AMUSING CONTRAST TO THE PROTRACTED APOLOGIES AND
CIVIL HESITATIONS OF THE OTHER.

"WELL, I BELIEVE, IF YOU WILL EXCUSE ME, MR. KNIGHTLEY, IF YOU WILL NOT
CONSIDER ME AS DOING A VERY RUDE THING, I SHALL TAKE EMMA'S ADVICE AND
GO OUT FOR A QUARTER OF AN HOUR. AS THE SUN IS OUT, I BELIEVE I HAD
BETTER TAKE MY THREE TURNS WHILE I CAN. I TREAT YOU WITHOUT CEREMONY,
MR. KNIGHTLEY. WE INVALIDS THINK WE ARE PRIVILEGED PEOPLE."

"MY DEAR SIR, DO NOT MAKE A STRANGER OF ME."

"I LEAVE AN EXCELLENT SUBSTITUTE IN MY DAUGHTER. EMMA WILL BE HAPPY TO
ENTERTAIN YOU. AND THEREFORE I THINK I WILL BEG YOUR EXCUSE AND TAKE MY
THREE TURNS--MY WINTER WALK."

"YOU CANNOT DO BETTER, SIR."

"I WOULD ASK FOR THE PLEASURE OF YOUR COMPANY, MR. KNIGHTLEY, BUT I AM A
VERY SLOW WALKER, AND MY PACE WOULD BE TEDIOUS TO YOU; AND, BESIDES, YOU
HAVE ANOTHER LONG WALK BEFORE YOU, TO DONWELL ABBEY."

"THANK YOU, SIR, THANK YOU; I AM GOING THIS MOMENT MYSELF; AND I THINK
THE SOONER YOU GO THE BETTER. I WILL FETCH YOUR GREATCOAT AND OPEN THE
GARDEN DOOR FOR YOU."

MR. WOODHOUSE AT LAST WAS OFF; BUT MR. KNIGHTLEY, INSTEAD OF BEING
IMMEDIATELY OFF LIKEWISE, SAT DOWN AGAIN, SEEMINGLY INCLINED FOR MORE
CHAT. HE BEGAN SPEAKING OF HARRIET, AND SPEAKING OF HER WITH MORE
VOLUNTARY PRAISE THAN EMMA HAD EVER HEARD BEFORE.

"I CANNOT RATE HER BEAUTY AS YOU DO," SAID HE; "BUT SHE IS A
PRETTY LITTLE CREATURE, AND I AM INCLINED TO THINK VERY WELL OF HER
DISPOSITION. HER CHARACTER DEPENDS UPON THOSE SHE IS WITH; BUT IN GOOD
HANDS SHE WILL TURN OUT A VALUABLE WOMAN."

"I AM GLAD YOU THINK SO; AND THE GOOD HANDS, I HOPE, MAY NOT BE
WANTING."

"COME," SAID HE, "YOU ARE ANXIOUS FOR A COMPLIMENT, SO I WILL TELL YOU
THAT YOU HAVE IMPROVED HER. YOU HAVE CURED HER OF HER SCHOOL-GIRL'S
GIGGLE; SHE REALLY DOES YOU CREDIT."

"THANK YOU. I SHOULD BE MORTIFIED INDEED IF I DID NOT BELIEVE I HAD BEEN
OF SOME USE; BUT IT IS NOT EVERY BODY WHO WILL BESTOW PRAISE WHERE THEY
MAY. YOU DO NOT OFTEN OVERPOWER ME WITH IT."

"YOU ARE EXPECTING HER AGAIN, YOU SAY, THIS MORNING?"

"ALMOST EVERY MOMENT. SHE HAS BEEN GONE LONGER ALREADY THAN SHE
INTENDED."

"SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED TO DELAY HER; SOME VISITORS PERHAPS."

"HIGHBURY GOSSIPS!--TIRESOME WRETCHES!"

"HARRIET MAY NOT CONSIDER EVERY BODY TIRESOME THAT YOU WOULD."

EMMA KNEW THIS WAS TOO TRUE FOR CONTRADICTION, AND THEREFORE SAID
NOTHING. HE PRESENTLY ADDED, WITH A SMILE,

"I DO NOT PRETEND TO FIX ON TIMES OR PLACES, BUT I MUST TELL YOU THAT
I HAVE GOOD REASON TO BELIEVE YOUR LITTLE FRIEND WILL SOON HEAR OF
SOMETHING TO HER ADVANTAGE."

"INDEED! HOW SO? OF WHAT SORT?"

"A VERY SERIOUS SORT, I ASSURE YOU;" STILL SMILING.

"VERY SERIOUS! I CAN THINK OF BUT ONE THING--WHO IS IN LOVE WITH HER?
WHO MAKES YOU THEIR CONFIDANT?"

EMMA WAS MORE THAN HALF IN HOPES OF MR. ELTON'S HAVING DROPT A HINT.
MR. KNIGHTLEY WAS A SORT OF GENERAL FRIEND AND ADVISER, AND SHE KNEW MR.
ELTON LOOKED UP TO HIM.

"I HAVE REASON TO THINK," HE REPLIED, "THAT HARRIET SMITH WILL SOON HAVE
AN OFFER OF MARRIAGE, AND FROM A MOST UNEXCEPTIONABLE QUARTER:--ROBERT
MARTIN IS THE MAN. HER VISIT TO ABBEY-MILL, THIS SUMMER, SEEMS TO HAVE
DONE HIS BUSINESS. HE IS DESPERATELY IN LOVE AND MEANS TO MARRY HER."

"HE IS VERY OBLIGING," SAID EMMA; "BUT IS HE SURE THAT HARRIET MEANS TO
MARRY HIM?"

"WELL, WELL, MEANS TO MAKE HER AN OFFER THEN. WILL THAT DO? HE CAME TO
THE ABBEY TWO EVENINGS AGO, ON PURPOSE TO CONSULT ME ABOUT IT. HE KNOWS
I HAVE A THOROUGH REGARD FOR HIM AND ALL HIS FAMILY, AND, I BELIEVE,
CONSIDERS ME AS ONE OF HIS BEST FRIENDS. HE CAME TO ASK ME WHETHER
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE IMPRUDENT IN HIM TO SETTLE SO EARLY; WHETHER
I THOUGHT HER TOO YOUNG: IN SHORT, WHETHER I APPROVED HIS CHOICE
ALTOGETHER; HAVING SOME APPREHENSION PERHAPS OF HER BEING CONSIDERED
(ESPECIALLY SINCE YOUR MAKING SO MUCH OF HER) AS IN A LINE OF SOCIETY
ABOVE HIM. I WAS VERY MUCH PLEASED WITH ALL THAT HE SAID. I NEVER HEAR
BETTER SENSE FROM ANY ONE THAN ROBERT MARTIN. HE ALWAYS SPEAKS TO THE
PURPOSE; OPEN, STRAIGHTFORWARD, AND VERY WELL JUDGING. HE TOLD ME EVERY
THING; HIS CIRCUMSTANCES AND PLANS, AND WHAT THEY ALL PROPOSED DOING IN
THE EVENT OF HIS MARRIAGE. HE IS AN EXCELLENT YOUNG MAN, BOTH AS SON AND
BROTHER. I HAD NO HESITATION IN ADVISING HIM TO MARRY. HE PROVED TO ME
THAT HE COULD AFFORD IT; AND THAT BEING THE CASE, I WAS CONVINCED HE
COULD NOT DO BETTER. I PRAISED THE FAIR LADY TOO, AND ALTOGETHER SENT
HIM AWAY VERY HAPPY. IF HE HAD NEVER ESTEEMED MY OPINION BEFORE, HE
WOULD HAVE THOUGHT HIGHLY OF ME THEN; AND, I DARE SAY, LEFT THE HOUSE
THINKING ME THE BEST FRIEND AND COUNSELLOR MAN EVER HAD. THIS HAPPENED
THE NIGHT BEFORE LAST. NOW, AS WE MAY FAIRLY SUPPOSE, HE WOULD NOT ALLOW
MUCH TIME TO PASS BEFORE HE SPOKE TO THE LADY, AND AS HE DOES NOT APPEAR
TO HAVE SPOKEN YESTERDAY, IT IS NOT UNLIKELY THAT HE SHOULD BE AT MRS.
GODDARD'S TO-DAY; AND SHE MAY BE DETAINED BY A VISITOR, WITHOUT THINKING
HIM AT ALL A TIRESOME WRETCH."

"PRAY, MR. KNIGHTLEY," SAID EMMA, WHO HAD BEEN SMILING TO HERSELF
THROUGH A GREAT PART OF THIS SPEECH, "HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT MR. MARTIN
DID NOT SPEAK YESTERDAY?"

"CERTAINLY," REPLIED HE, SURPRIZED, "I DO NOT ABSOLUTELY KNOW IT; BUT IT
MAY BE INFERRED. WAS NOT SHE THE WHOLE DAY WITH YOU?"

"COME," SAID SHE, "I WILL TELL YOU SOMETHING, IN RETURN FOR WHAT
YOU HAVE TOLD ME. HE DID SPEAK YESTERDAY--THAT IS, HE WROTE, AND WAS
REFUSED."

THIS WAS OBLIGED TO BE REPEATED BEFORE IT COULD BE BELIEVED; AND MR.
KNIGHTLEY ACTUALLY LOOKED RED WITH SURPRIZE AND DISPLEASURE, AS HE STOOD
UP, IN TALL INDIGNATION, AND SAID,

"THEN SHE IS A GREATER SIMPLETON THAN I EVER BELIEVED HER. WHAT IS THE
FOOLISH GIRL ABOUT?"

"OH! TO BE SURE," CRIED EMMA, "IT IS ALWAYS INCOMPREHENSIBLE TO A MAN
THAT A WOMAN SHOULD EVER REFUSE AN OFFER OF MARRIAGE. A MAN ALWAYS
IMAGINES A WOMAN TO BE READY FOR ANY BODY WHO ASKS HER."

"NONSENSE! A MAN DOES NOT IMAGINE ANY SUCH THING. BUT WHAT IS THE
MEANING OF THIS? HARRIET SMITH REFUSE ROBERT MARTIN? MADNESS, IF IT IS
SO; BUT I HOPE YOU ARE MISTAKEN."

"I SAW HER ANSWER!--NOTHING COULD BE CLEARER."

"YOU SAW HER ANSWER!--YOU WROTE HER ANSWER TOO. EMMA, THIS IS YOUR
DOING. YOU PERSUADED HER TO REFUSE HIM."

"AND IF I DID, (WHICH, HOWEVER, I AM FAR FROM ALLOWING) I SHOULD NOT
FEEL THAT I HAD DONE WRONG. MR. MARTIN IS A VERY RESPECTABLE YOUNG MAN,
BUT I CANNOT ADMIT HIM TO BE HARRIET'S EQUAL; AND AM RATHER SURPRIZED
INDEED THAT HE SHOULD HAVE VENTURED TO ADDRESS HER. BY YOUR ACCOUNT, HE
DOES SEEM TO HAVE HAD SOME SCRUPLES. IT IS A PITY THAT THEY WERE EVER
GOT OVER."

"NOT HARRIET'S EQUAL!" EXCLAIMED MR. KNIGHTLEY LOUDLY AND WARMLY; AND
WITH CALMER ASPERITY, ADDED, A FEW MOMENTS AFTERWARDS, "NO, HE IS
NOT HER EQUAL INDEED, FOR HE IS AS MUCH HER SUPERIOR IN SENSE AS IN
SITUATION. EMMA, YOUR INFATUATION ABOUT THAT GIRL BLINDS YOU. WHAT ARE
HARRIET SMITH'S CLAIMS, EITHER OF BIRTH, NATURE OR EDUCATION, TO ANY
CONNEXION HIGHER THAN ROBERT MARTIN? SHE IS THE NATURAL DAUGHTER OF
NOBODY KNOWS WHOM, WITH PROBABLY NO SETTLED PROVISION AT ALL, AND
CERTAINLY NO RESPECTABLE RELATIONS. SHE IS KNOWN ONLY AS PARLOUR-BOARDER
AT A COMMON SCHOOL. SHE IS NOT A SENSIBLE GIRL, NOR A GIRL OF ANY
INFORMATION. SHE HAS BEEN TAUGHT NOTHING USEFUL, AND IS TOO YOUNG AND
TOO SIMPLE TO HAVE ACQUIRED ANY THING HERSELF. AT HER AGE SHE CAN HAVE
NO EXPERIENCE, AND WITH HER LITTLE WIT, IS NOT VERY LIKELY EVER TO HAVE
ANY THAT CAN AVAIL HER. SHE IS PRETTY, AND SHE IS GOOD TEMPERED, AND
THAT IS ALL. MY ONLY SCRUPLE IN ADVISING THE MATCH WAS ON HIS ACCOUNT,
AS BEING BENEATH HIS DESERTS, AND A BAD CONNEXION FOR HIM. I FELT THAT,
AS TO FORTUNE, IN ALL PROBABILITY HE MIGHT DO MUCH BETTER; AND THAT AS
TO A RATIONAL COMPANION OR USEFUL HELPMATE, HE COULD NOT DO WORSE. BUT I
COULD NOT REASON SO TO A MAN IN LOVE, AND WAS WILLING TO TRUST TO THERE
BEING NO HARM IN HER, TO HER HAVING THAT SORT OF DISPOSITION, WHICH, IN
GOOD HANDS, LIKE HIS, MIGHT BE EASILY LED ARIGHT AND TURN OUT VERY WELL.
THE ADVANTAGE OF THE MATCH I FELT TO BE ALL ON HER SIDE; AND HAD NOT THE
SMALLEST DOUBT (NOR HAVE I NOW) THAT THERE WOULD BE A GENERAL CRY-OUT
UPON HER EXTREME GOOD LUCK. EVEN YOUR SATISFACTION I MADE SURE OF.
IT CROSSED MY MIND IMMEDIATELY THAT YOU WOULD NOT REGRET YOUR FRIEND'S
LEAVING HIGHBURY, FOR THE SAKE OF HER BEING SETTLED SO WELL. I REMEMBER
SAYING TO MYSELF, 'EVEN EMMA, WITH ALL HER PARTIALITY FOR HARRIET, WILL
THINK THIS A GOOD MATCH.'"

"I CANNOT HELP WONDERING AT YOUR KNOWING SO LITTLE OF EMMA AS TO SAY ANY
SUCH THING. WHAT! THINK A FARMER, (AND WITH ALL HIS SENSE AND ALL HIS
MERIT MR. MARTIN IS NOTHING MORE,) A GOOD MATCH FOR MY INTIMATE FRIEND!
NOT REGRET HER LEAVING HIGHBURY FOR THE SAKE OF MARRYING A MAN WHOM
I COULD NEVER ADMIT AS AN ACQUAINTANCE OF MY OWN! I WONDER YOU SHOULD
THINK IT POSSIBLE FOR ME TO HAVE SUCH FEELINGS. I ASSURE YOU MINE ARE
VERY DIFFERENT. I MUST THINK YOUR STATEMENT BY NO MEANS FAIR. YOU ARE
NOT JUST TO HARRIET'S CLAIMS. THEY WOULD BE ESTIMATED VERY DIFFERENTLY
BY OTHERS AS WELL AS MYSELF; MR. MARTIN MAY BE THE RICHEST OF THE TWO,
BUT HE IS UNDOUBTEDLY HER INFERIOR AS TO RANK IN SOCIETY.--THE SPHERE IN
WHICH SHE MOVES IS MUCH ABOVE HIS.--IT WOULD BE A DEGRADATION."

"A DEGRADATION TO ILLEGITIMACY AND IGNORANCE, TO BE MARRIED TO A
RESPECTABLE, INTELLIGENT GENTLEMAN-FARMER!"

"AS TO THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF HER BIRTH, THOUGH IN A LEGAL SENSE SHE MAY
BE CALLED NOBODY, IT WILL NOT HOLD IN COMMON SENSE. SHE IS NOT TO PAY
FOR THE OFFENCE OF OTHERS, BY BEING HELD BELOW THE LEVEL OF THOSE WITH
WHOM SHE IS BROUGHT UP.--THERE CAN SCARCELY BE A DOUBT THAT HER FATHER
IS A GENTLEMAN--AND A GENTLEMAN OF FORTUNE.--HER ALLOWANCE IS
VERY LIBERAL; NOTHING HAS EVER BEEN GRUDGED FOR HER IMPROVEMENT OR
COMFORT.--THAT SHE IS A GENTLEMAN'S DAUGHTER, IS INDUBITABLE TO ME; THAT
SHE ASSOCIATES WITH GENTLEMEN'S DAUGHTERS, NO ONE, I APPREHEND, WILL
DENY.--SHE IS SUPERIOR TO MR. ROBERT MARTIN."

"WHOEVER MIGHT BE HER PARENTS," SAID MR. KNIGHTLEY, "WHOEVER MAY HAVE
HAD THE CHARGE OF HER, IT DOES NOT APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN ANY PART OF
THEIR PLAN TO INTRODUCE HER INTO WHAT YOU WOULD CALL GOOD SOCIETY. AFTER
RECEIVING A VERY INDIFFERENT EDUCATION SHE IS LEFT IN MRS. GODDARD'S
HANDS TO SHIFT AS SHE CAN;--TO MOVE, IN SHORT, IN MRS. GODDARD'S LINE,
TO HAVE MRS. GODDARD'S ACQUAINTANCE. HER FRIENDS EVIDENTLY THOUGHT
THIS GOOD ENOUGH FOR HER; AND IT WAS GOOD ENOUGH. SHE DESIRED NOTHING
BETTER HERSELF. TILL YOU CHOSE TO TURN HER INTO A FRIEND, HER MIND HAD
NO DISTASTE FOR HER OWN SET, NOR ANY AMBITION BEYOND IT. SHE WAS AS
HAPPY AS POSSIBLE WITH THE MARTINS IN THE SUMMER. SHE HAD NO SENSE OF
SUPERIORITY THEN. IF SHE HAS IT NOW, YOU HAVE GIVEN IT. YOU HAVE BEEN NO
FRIEND TO HARRIET SMITH, EMMA. ROBERT MARTIN WOULD NEVER HAVE PROCEEDED
SO FAR, IF HE HAD NOT FELT PERSUADED OF HER NOT BEING DISINCLINED TO
HIM. I KNOW HIM WELL. HE HAS TOO MUCH REAL FEELING TO ADDRESS ANY
WOMAN ON THE HAPHAZARD OF SELFISH PASSION. AND AS TO CONCEIT, HE IS
THE FARTHEST FROM IT OF ANY MAN I KNOW. DEPEND UPON IT HE HAD
ENCOURAGEMENT."

IT WAS MOST CONVENIENT TO EMMA NOT TO MAKE A DIRECT REPLY TO THIS
ASSERTION; SHE CHOSE RATHER TO TAKE UP HER OWN LINE OF THE SUBJECT
AGAIN.

"YOU ARE A VERY WARM FRIEND TO MR. MARTIN; BUT, AS I SAID BEFORE,
ARE UNJUST TO HARRIET. HARRIET'S CLAIMS TO MARRY WELL ARE NOT SO
CONTEMPTIBLE AS YOU REPRESENT THEM. SHE IS NOT A CLEVER GIRL, BUT SHE
HAS BETTER SENSE THAN YOU ARE AWARE OF, AND DOES NOT DESERVE TO HAVE HER
UNDERSTANDING SPOKEN OF SO SLIGHTINGLY. WAIVING THAT POINT, HOWEVER, AND
SUPPOSING HER TO BE, AS YOU DESCRIBE HER, ONLY PRETTY AND GOOD-NATURED,
LET ME TELL YOU, THAT IN THE DEGREE SHE POSSESSES THEM, THEY ARE NOT
TRIVIAL RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE WORLD IN GENERAL, FOR SHE IS, IN FACT, A
BEAUTIFUL GIRL, AND MUST BE THOUGHT SO BY NINETY-NINE PEOPLE OUT OF AN
HUNDRED; AND TILL IT APPEARS THAT MEN ARE MUCH MORE PHILOSOPHIC ON THE
SUBJECT OF BEAUTY THAN THEY ARE GENERALLY SUPPOSED; TILL THEY DO FALL
IN LOVE WITH WELL-INFORMED MINDS INSTEAD OF HANDSOME FACES, A GIRL, WITH
SUCH LOVELINESS AS HARRIET, HAS A CERTAINTY OF BEING ADMIRED AND SOUGHT
AFTER, OF HAVING THE POWER OF CHUSING FROM AMONG MANY, CONSEQUENTLY A
CLAIM TO BE NICE. HER GOOD-NATURE, TOO, IS NOT SO VERY SLIGHT A CLAIM,
COMPREHENDING, AS IT DOES, REAL, THOROUGH SWEETNESS OF TEMPER AND
MANNER, A VERY HUMBLE OPINION OF HERSELF, AND A GREAT READINESS TO
BE PLEASED WITH OTHER PEOPLE. I AM VERY MUCH MISTAKEN IF YOUR SEX IN
GENERAL WOULD NOT THINK SUCH BEAUTY, AND SUCH TEMPER, THE HIGHEST CLAIMS
A WOMAN COULD POSSESS."

"UPON MY WORD, EMMA, TO HEAR YOU ABUSING THE REASON YOU HAVE, IS ALMOST
ENOUGH TO MAKE ME THINK SO TOO. BETTER BE WITHOUT SENSE, THAN MISAPPLY
IT AS YOU DO."

"TO BE SURE!" CRIED SHE PLAYFULLY. "I KNOW THAT IS THE FEELING OF
YOU ALL. I KNOW THAT SUCH A GIRL AS HARRIET IS EXACTLY WHAT EVERY
MAN DELIGHTS IN--WHAT AT ONCE BEWITCHES HIS SENSES AND SATISFIES HIS
JUDGMENT. OH! HARRIET MAY PICK AND CHUSE. WERE YOU, YOURSELF, EVER TO
MARRY, SHE IS THE VERY WOMAN FOR YOU. AND IS SHE, AT SEVENTEEN, JUST
ENTERING INTO LIFE, JUST BEGINNING TO BE KNOWN, TO BE WONDERED AT
BECAUSE SHE DOES NOT ACCEPT THE FIRST OFFER SHE RECEIVES? NO--PRAY LET
HER HAVE TIME TO LOOK ABOUT HER."

"I HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT IT A VERY FOOLISH INTIMACY," SAID MR. KNIGHTLEY
PRESENTLY, "THOUGH I HAVE KEPT MY THOUGHTS TO MYSELF; BUT I NOW PERCEIVE
THAT IT WILL BE A VERY UNFORTUNATE ONE FOR HARRIET. YOU WILL PUFF HER UP
WITH SUCH IDEAS OF HER OWN BEAUTY, AND OF WHAT SHE HAS A CLAIM TO, THAT,
IN A LITTLE WHILE, NOBODY WITHIN HER REACH WILL BE GOOD ENOUGH FOR HER.
VANITY WORKING ON A WEAK HEAD, PRODUCES EVERY SORT OF MISCHIEF. NOTHING
SO EASY AS FOR A YOUNG LADY TO RAISE HER EXPECTATIONS TOO HIGH. MISS
HARRIET SMITH MAY NOT FIND OFFERS OF MARRIAGE FLOW IN SO FAST, THOUGH
SHE IS A VERY PRETTY GIRL. MEN OF SENSE, WHATEVER YOU MAY CHUSE TO
SAY, DO NOT WANT SILLY WIVES. MEN OF FAMILY WOULD NOT BE VERY FOND OF
CONNECTING THEMSELVES WITH A GIRL OF SUCH OBSCURITY--AND MOST PRUDENT
MEN WOULD BE AFRAID OF THE INCONVENIENCE AND DISGRACE THEY MIGHT BE
INVOLVED IN, WHEN THE MYSTERY OF HER PARENTAGE CAME TO BE REVEALED. LET
HER MARRY ROBERT MARTIN, AND SHE IS SAFE, RESPECTABLE, AND HAPPY FOR
EVER; BUT IF YOU ENCOURAGE HER TO EXPECT TO MARRY GREATLY, AND TEACH HER
TO BE SATISFIED WITH NOTHING LESS THAN A MAN OF CONSEQUENCE AND LARGE
FORTUNE, SHE MAY BE A PARLOUR-BOARDER AT MRS. GODDARD'S ALL THE REST
OF HER LIFE--OR, AT LEAST, (FOR HARRIET SMITH IS A GIRL WHO WILL MARRY
SOMEBODY OR OTHER,) TILL SHE GROW DESPERATE, AND IS GLAD TO CATCH AT THE
OLD WRITING-MASTER'S SON."

"WE THINK SO VERY DIFFERENTLY ON THIS POINT, MR. KNIGHTLEY, THAT THERE
CAN BE NO USE IN CANVASSING IT. WE SHALL ONLY BE MAKING EACH OTHER MORE
ANGRY. BUT AS TO MY LETTING HER MARRY ROBERT MARTIN, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE;
SHE HAS REFUSED HIM, AND SO DECIDEDLY, I THINK, AS MUST PREVENT ANY
SECOND APPLICATION. SHE MUST ABIDE BY THE EVIL OF HAVING REFUSED HIM,
WHATEVER IT MAY BE; AND AS TO THE REFUSAL ITSELF, I WILL NOT PRETEND TO
SAY THAT I MIGHT NOT INFLUENCE HER A LITTLE; BUT I ASSURE YOU THERE
WAS VERY LITTLE FOR ME OR FOR ANY BODY TO DO. HIS APPEARANCE IS SO MUCH
AGAINST HIM, AND HIS MANNER SO BAD, THAT IF SHE EVER WERE DISPOSED TO
FAVOUR HIM, SHE IS NOT NOW. I CAN IMAGINE, THAT BEFORE SHE HAD SEEN
ANY BODY SUPERIOR, SHE MIGHT TOLERATE HIM. HE WAS THE BROTHER OF HER
FRIENDS, AND HE TOOK PAINS TO PLEASE HER; AND ALTOGETHER, HAVING SEEN
NOBODY BETTER (THAT MUST HAVE BEEN HIS GREAT ASSISTANT) SHE MIGHT NOT,
WHILE SHE WAS AT ABBEY-MILL, FIND HIM DISAGREEABLE. BUT THE CASE
IS ALTERED NOW. SHE KNOWS NOW WHAT GENTLEMEN ARE; AND NOTHING BUT A
GENTLEMAN IN EDUCATION AND MANNER HAS ANY CHANCE WITH HARRIET."

"NONSENSE, ERRANT NONSENSE, AS EVER WAS TALKED!" CRIED MR.
KNIGHTLEY.--"ROBERT MARTIN'S MANNERS HAVE SENSE, SINCERITY, AND
GOOD-HUMOUR TO RECOMMEND THEM; AND HIS MIND HAS MORE TRUE GENTILITY THAN
HARRIET SMITH COULD UNDERSTAND."

EMMA MADE NO ANSWER, AND TRIED TO LOOK CHEERFULLY UNCONCERNED, BUT WAS
REALLY FEELING UNCOMFORTABLE AND WANTING HIM VERY MUCH TO BE GONE. SHE
DID NOT REPENT WHAT SHE HAD DONE; SHE STILL THOUGHT HERSELF A BETTER
JUDGE OF SUCH A POINT OF FEMALE RIGHT AND REFINEMENT THAN HE COULD BE;
BUT YET SHE HAD A SORT OF HABITUAL RESPECT FOR HIS JUDGMENT IN GENERAL,
WHICH MADE HER DISLIKE HAVING IT SO LOUDLY AGAINST HER; AND TO HAVE HIM
SITTING JUST OPPOSITE TO HER IN ANGRY STATE, WAS VERY DISAGREEABLE.
SOME MINUTES PASSED IN THIS UNPLEASANT SILENCE, WITH ONLY ONE ATTEMPT
ON EMMA'S SIDE TO TALK OF THE WEATHER, BUT HE MADE NO ANSWER. HE WAS
THINKING. THE RESULT OF HIS THOUGHTS APPEARED AT LAST IN THESE WORDS.

"ROBERT MARTIN HAS NO GREAT LOSS--IF HE CAN BUT THINK SO; AND I HOPE IT
WILL NOT BE LONG BEFORE HE DOES. YOUR VIEWS FOR HARRIET ARE BEST KNOWN
TO YOURSELF; BUT AS YOU MAKE NO SECRET OF YOUR LOVE OF MATCH-MAKING, IT
IS FAIR TO SUPPOSE THAT VIEWS, AND PLANS, AND PROJECTS YOU HAVE;--AND AS
A FRIEND I SHALL JUST HINT TO YOU THAT IF ELTON IS THE MAN, I THINK IT
WILL BE ALL LABOUR IN VAIN."

EMMA LAUGHED AND DISCLAIMED. HE CONTINUED,

"DEPEND UPON IT, ELTON WILL NOT DO. ELTON IS A VERY GOOD SORT OF MAN,
AND A VERY RESPECTABLE VICAR OF HIGHBURY, BUT NOT AT ALL LIKELY TO MAKE
AN IMPRUDENT MATCH. HE KNOWS THE VALUE OF A GOOD INCOME AS WELL AS ANY
BODY. ELTON MAY TALK SENTIMENTALLY, BUT HE WILL ACT RATIONALLY. HE IS
AS WELL ACQUAINTED WITH HIS OWN CLAIMS, AS YOU CAN BE WITH HARRIET'S.
HE KNOWS THAT HE IS A VERY HANDSOME YOUNG MAN, AND A GREAT FAVOURITE
WHEREVER HE GOES; AND FROM HIS GENERAL WAY OF TALKING IN UNRESERVED
MOMENTS, WHEN THERE ARE ONLY MEN PRESENT, I AM CONVINCED THAT HE DOES
NOT MEAN TO THROW HIMSELF AWAY. I HAVE HEARD HIM SPEAK WITH GREAT
ANIMATION OF A LARGE FAMILY OF YOUNG LADIES THAT HIS SISTERS ARE
INTIMATE WITH, WHO HAVE ALL TWENTY THOUSAND POUNDS APIECE."

"I AM VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU," SAID EMMA, LAUGHING AGAIN. "IF I HAD
SET MY HEART ON MR. ELTON'S MARRYING HARRIET, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY
KIND TO OPEN MY EYES; BUT AT PRESENT I ONLY WANT TO KEEP HARRIET TO
MYSELF. I HAVE DONE WITH MATCH-MAKING INDEED. I COULD NEVER HOPE TO
EQUAL MY OWN DOINGS AT RANDALLS. I SHALL LEAVE OFF WHILE I AM WELL."

"GOOD MORNING TO YOU,"--SAID HE, RISING AND WALKING OFF ABRUPTLY. HE WAS
VERY MUCH VEXED. HE FELT THE DISAPPOINTMENT OF THE YOUNG MAN, AND WAS
MORTIFIED TO HAVE BEEN THE MEANS OF PROMOTING IT, BY THE SANCTION HE HAD
GIVEN; AND THE PART WHICH HE WAS PERSUADED EMMA HAD TAKEN IN THE AFFAIR,
WAS PROVOKING HIM EXCEEDINGLY.

EMMA REMAINED IN A STATE OF VEXATION TOO; BUT THERE WAS MORE
INDISTINCTNESS IN THE CAUSES OF HER'S, THAN IN HIS. SHE DID NOT ALWAYS
FEEL SO ABSOLUTELY SATISFIED WITH HERSELF, SO ENTIRELY CONVINCED THAT
HER OPINIONS WERE RIGHT AND HER ADVERSARY'S WRONG, AS MR. KNIGHTLEY. HE
WALKED OFF IN MORE COMPLETE SELF-APPROBATION THAN HE LEFT FOR HER. SHE
WAS NOT SO MATERIALLY CAST DOWN, HOWEVER, BUT THAT A LITTLE TIME AND
THE RETURN OF HARRIET WERE VERY ADEQUATE RESTORATIVES. HARRIET'S STAYING
AWAY SO LONG WAS BEGINNING TO MAKE HER UNEASY. THE POSSIBILITY OF THE
YOUNG MAN'S COMING TO MRS. GODDARD'S THAT MORNING, AND MEETING WITH
HARRIET AND PLEADING HIS OWN CAUSE, GAVE ALARMING IDEAS. THE DREAD
OF SUCH A FAILURE AFTER ALL BECAME THE PROMINENT UNEASINESS; AND WHEN
HARRIET APPEARED, AND IN VERY GOOD SPIRITS, AND WITHOUT HAVING ANY
SUCH REASON TO GIVE FOR HER LONG ABSENCE, SHE FELT A SATISFACTION WHICH
SETTLED HER WITH HER OWN MIND, AND CONVINCED HER, THAT LET MR.
KNIGHTLEY THINK OR SAY WHAT HE WOULD, SHE HAD DONE NOTHING WHICH WOMAN'S
FRIENDSHIP AND WOMAN'S FEELINGS WOULD NOT JUSTIFY.

HE HAD FRIGHTENED HER A LITTLE ABOUT MR. ELTON; BUT WHEN SHE CONSIDERED
THAT MR. KNIGHTLEY COULD NOT HAVE OBSERVED HIM AS SHE HAD DONE, NEITHER
WITH THE INTEREST, NOR (SHE MUST BE ALLOWED TO TELL HERSELF, IN SPITE OF
MR. KNIGHTLEY'S PRETENSIONS) WITH THE SKILL OF SUCH AN OBSERVER ON SUCH
A QUESTION AS HERSELF, THAT HE HAD SPOKEN IT HASTILY AND IN ANGER, SHE
WAS ABLE TO BELIEVE, THAT HE HAD RATHER SAID WHAT HE WISHED RESENTFULLY
TO BE TRUE, THAN WHAT HE KNEW ANY THING ABOUT. HE CERTAINLY MIGHT HAVE
HEARD MR. ELTON SPEAK WITH MORE UNRESERVE THAN SHE HAD EVER DONE, AND
MR. ELTON MIGHT NOT BE OF AN IMPRUDENT, INCONSIDERATE DISPOSITION AS TO
MONEY MATTERS; HE MIGHT NATURALLY BE RATHER ATTENTIVE THAN OTHERWISE
TO THEM; BUT THEN, MR. KNIGHTLEY DID NOT MAKE DUE ALLOWANCE FOR THE
INFLUENCE OF A STRONG PASSION AT WAR WITH ALL INTERESTED MOTIVES. MR.
KNIGHTLEY SAW NO SUCH PASSION, AND OF COURSE THOUGHT NOTHING OF ITS
EFFECTS; BUT SHE SAW TOO MUCH OF IT TO FEEL A DOUBT OF ITS OVERCOMING
ANY HESITATIONS THAT A REASONABLE PRUDENCE MIGHT ORIGINALLY SUGGEST; AND
MORE THAN A REASONABLE, BECOMING DEGREE OF PRUDENCE, SHE WAS VERY SURE
DID NOT BELONG TO MR. ELTON.

HARRIET'S CHEERFUL LOOK AND MANNER ESTABLISHED HERS: SHE CAME BACK, NOT
TO THINK OF MR. MARTIN, BUT TO TALK OF MR. ELTON. MISS NASH HAD BEEN
TELLING HER SOMETHING, WHICH SHE REPEATED IMMEDIATELY WITH GREAT
DELIGHT. MR. PERRY HAD BEEN TO MRS. GODDARD'S TO ATTEND A SICK CHILD,
AND MISS NASH HAD SEEN HIM, AND HE HAD TOLD MISS NASH, THAT AS HE WAS
COMING BACK YESTERDAY FROM CLAYTON PARK, HE HAD MET MR. ELTON, AND
FOUND TO HIS GREAT SURPRIZE, THAT MR. ELTON WAS ACTUALLY ON HIS ROAD
TO LONDON, AND NOT MEANING TO RETURN TILL THE MORROW, THOUGH IT WAS THE
WHIST-CLUB NIGHT, WHICH HE HAD BEEN NEVER KNOWN TO MISS BEFORE; AND MR.
PERRY HAD REMONSTRATED WITH HIM ABOUT IT, AND TOLD HIM HOW SHABBY IT
WAS IN HIM, THEIR BEST PLAYER, TO ABSENT HIMSELF, AND TRIED VERY MUCH TO
PERSUADE HIM TO PUT OFF HIS JOURNEY ONLY ONE DAY; BUT IT WOULD NOT
DO; MR. ELTON HAD BEEN DETERMINED TO GO ON, AND HAD SAID IN A VERY
PARTICULAR WAY INDEED, THAT HE WAS GOING ON BUSINESS WHICH HE WOULD
NOT PUT OFF FOR ANY INDUCEMENT IN THE WORLD; AND SOMETHING ABOUT A
VERY ENVIABLE COMMISSION, AND BEING THE BEARER OF SOMETHING EXCEEDINGLY
PRECIOUS. MR. PERRY COULD NOT QUITE UNDERSTAND HIM, BUT HE WAS VERY SURE
THERE MUST BE A LADY IN THE CASE, AND HE TOLD HIM SO; AND MR. ELTON
ONLY LOOKED VERY CONSCIOUS AND SMILING, AND RODE OFF IN GREAT SPIRITS.
MISS NASH HAD TOLD HER ALL THIS, AND HAD TALKED A GREAT DEAL MORE ABOUT
MR. ELTON; AND SAID, LOOKING SO VERY SIGNIFICANTLY AT HER, "THAT SHE DID
NOT PRETEND TO UNDERSTAND WHAT HIS BUSINESS MIGHT BE, BUT SHE ONLY
KNEW THAT ANY WOMAN WHOM MR. ELTON COULD PREFER, SHE SHOULD THINK THE
LUCKIEST WOMAN IN THE WORLD; FOR, BEYOND A DOUBT, MR. ELTON HAD NOT HIS
EQUAL FOR BEAUTY OR AGREEABLENESS."



CHAPTER IX


MR. KNIGHTLEY MIGHT QUARREL WITH HER, BUT EMMA COULD NOT QUARREL WITH
HERSELF. HE WAS SO MUCH DISPLEASED, THAT IT WAS LONGER THAN USUAL BEFORE
HE CAME TO HARTFIELD AGAIN; AND WHEN THEY DID MEET, HIS GRAVE LOOKS
SHEWED THAT SHE WAS NOT FORGIVEN. SHE WAS SORRY, BUT COULD NOT REPENT.
ON THE CONTRARY, HER PLANS AND PROCEEDINGS WERE MORE AND MORE JUSTIFIED
AND ENDEARED TO HER BY THE GENERAL APPEARANCES OF THE NEXT FEW DAYS.

THE PICTURE, ELEGANTLY FRAMED, CAME SAFELY TO HAND SOON AFTER MR.
ELTON'S RETURN, AND BEING HUNG OVER THE MANTELPIECE OF THE COMMON
SITTING-ROOM, HE GOT UP TO LOOK AT IT, AND SIGHED OUT HIS HALF SENTENCES
OF ADMIRATION JUST AS HE OUGHT; AND AS FOR HARRIET'S FEELINGS, THEY WERE
VISIBLY FORMING THEMSELVES INTO AS STRONG AND STEADY AN ATTACHMENT AS
HER YOUTH AND SORT OF MIND ADMITTED. EMMA WAS SOON PERFECTLY SATISFIED
OF MR. MARTIN'S BEING NO OTHERWISE REMEMBERED, THAN AS HE FURNISHED A
CONTRAST WITH MR. ELTON, OF THE UTMOST ADVANTAGE TO THE LATTER.

HER VIEWS OF IMPROVING HER LITTLE FRIEND'S MIND, BY A GREAT DEAL OF
USEFUL READING AND CONVERSATION, HAD NEVER YET LED TO MORE THAN A FEW
FIRST CHAPTERS, AND THE INTENTION OF GOING ON TO-MORROW. IT WAS MUCH
EASIER TO CHAT THAN TO STUDY; MUCH PLEASANTER TO LET HER IMAGINATION
RANGE AND WORK AT HARRIET'S FORTUNE, THAN TO BE LABOURING TO ENLARGE
HER COMPREHENSION OR EXERCISE IT ON SOBER FACTS; AND THE ONLY LITERARY
PURSUIT WHICH ENGAGED HARRIET AT PRESENT, THE ONLY MENTAL PROVISION SHE
WAS MAKING FOR THE EVENING OF LIFE, WAS THE COLLECTING AND TRANSCRIBING
ALL THE RIDDLES OF EVERY SORT THAT SHE COULD MEET WITH, INTO A THIN
QUARTO OF HOT-PRESSED PAPER, MADE UP BY HER FRIEND, AND ORNAMENTED WITH
CIPHERS AND TROPHIES.

IN THIS AGE OF LITERATURE, SUCH COLLECTIONS ON A VERY GRAND SCALE ARE
NOT UNCOMMON. MISS NASH, HEAD-TEACHER AT MRS. GODDARD'S, HAD WRITTEN OUT
AT LEAST THREE HUNDRED; AND HARRIET, WHO HAD TAKEN THE FIRST HINT OF IT
FROM HER, HOPED, WITH MISS WOODHOUSE'S HELP, TO GET A GREAT MANY MORE.
EMMA ASSISTED WITH HER INVENTION, MEMORY AND TASTE; AND AS HARRIET WROTE
A VERY PRETTY HAND, IT WAS LIKELY TO BE AN ARRANGEMENT OF THE FIRST
ORDER, IN FORM AS WELL AS QUANTITY.

MR. WOODHOUSE WAS ALMOST AS MUCH INTERESTED IN THE BUSINESS AS THE
GIRLS, AND TRIED VERY OFTEN TO RECOLLECT SOMETHING WORTH THEIR PUTTING
IN. "SO MANY CLEVER RIDDLES AS THERE USED TO BE WHEN HE WAS YOUNG--HE
WONDERED HE COULD NOT REMEMBER THEM! BUT HE HOPED HE SHOULD IN TIME."
AND IT ALWAYS ENDED IN "KITTY, A FAIR BUT FROZEN MAID."

HIS GOOD FRIEND PERRY, TOO, WHOM HE HAD SPOKEN TO ON THE SUBJECT,
DID NOT AT PRESENT RECOLLECT ANY THING OF THE RIDDLE KIND; BUT HE
HAD DESIRED PERRY TO BE UPON THE WATCH, AND AS HE WENT ABOUT SO MUCH,
SOMETHING, HE THOUGHT, MIGHT COME FROM THAT QUARTER.

IT WAS BY NO MEANS HIS DAUGHTER'S WISH THAT THE INTELLECTS OF HIGHBURY
IN GENERAL SHOULD BE PUT UNDER REQUISITION. MR. ELTON WAS THE ONLY ONE
WHOSE ASSISTANCE SHE ASKED. HE WAS INVITED TO CONTRIBUTE ANY REALLY GOOD
ENIGMAS, CHARADES, OR CONUNDRUMS THAT HE MIGHT RECOLLECT; AND SHE HAD
THE PLEASURE OF SEEING HIM MOST INTENTLY AT WORK WITH HIS RECOLLECTIONS;
AND AT THE SAME TIME, AS SHE COULD PERCEIVE, MOST EARNESTLY CAREFUL THAT
NOTHING UNGALLANT, NOTHING THAT DID NOT BREATHE A COMPLIMENT TO THE
SEX SHOULD PASS HIS LIPS. THEY OWED TO HIM THEIR TWO OR THREE POLITEST
PUZZLES; AND THE JOY AND EXULTATION WITH WHICH AT LAST HE RECALLED, AND
RATHER SENTIMENTALLY RECITED, THAT WELL-KNOWN CHARADE,

    MY FIRST DOTH AFFLICTION DENOTE,
      WHICH MY SECOND IS DESTIN'D TO FEEL
    AND MY WHOLE IS THE BEST ANTIDOTE
      THAT AFFLICTION TO SOFTEN AND HEAL.--

MADE HER QUITE SORRY TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THEY HAD TRANSCRIBED IT SOME
PAGES AGO ALREADY.

"WHY WILL NOT YOU WRITE ONE YOURSELF FOR US, MR. ELTON?" SAID SHE; "THAT
IS THE ONLY SECURITY FOR ITS FRESHNESS; AND NOTHING COULD BE EASIER TO
YOU."

"OH NO! HE HAD NEVER WRITTEN, HARDLY EVER, ANY THING OF THE KIND IN HIS
LIFE. THE STUPIDEST FELLOW! HE WAS AFRAID NOT EVEN MISS WOODHOUSE"--HE
STOPT A MOMENT--"OR MISS SMITH COULD INSPIRE HIM."

THE VERY NEXT DAY HOWEVER PRODUCED SOME PROOF OF INSPIRATION. HE
CALLED FOR A FEW MOMENTS, JUST TO LEAVE A PIECE OF PAPER ON THE TABLE
CONTAINING, AS HE SAID, A CHARADE, WHICH A FRIEND OF HIS HAD ADDRESSED
TO A YOUNG LADY, THE OBJECT OF HIS ADMIRATION, BUT WHICH, FROM HIS
MANNER, EMMA WAS IMMEDIATELY CONVINCED MUST BE HIS OWN.

"I DO NOT OFFER IT FOR MISS SMITH'S COLLECTION," SAID HE. "BEING MY
FRIEND'S, I HAVE NO RIGHT TO EXPOSE IT IN ANY DEGREE TO THE PUBLIC EYE,
BUT PERHAPS YOU MAY NOT DISLIKE LOOKING AT IT."

THE SPEECH WAS MORE TO EMMA THAN TO HARRIET, WHICH EMMA COULD
UNDERSTAND. THERE WAS DEEP CONSCIOUSNESS ABOUT HIM, AND HE FOUND
IT EASIER TO MEET HER EYE THAN HER FRIEND'S. HE WAS GONE THE NEXT
MOMENT:--AFTER ANOTHER MOMENT'S PAUSE,

"TAKE IT," SAID EMMA, SMILING, AND PUSHING THE PAPER TOWARDS
HARRIET--"IT IS FOR YOU. TAKE YOUR OWN."

BUT HARRIET WAS IN A TREMOR, AND COULD NOT TOUCH IT; AND EMMA, NEVER
LOTH TO BE FIRST, WAS OBLIGED TO EXAMINE IT HERSELF.

        TO MISS--

          CHARADE.

    MY FIRST DISPLAYS THE WEALTH AND POMP OF KINGS,
      LORDS OF THE EARTH! THEIR LUXURY AND EASE.
    ANOTHER VIEW OF MAN, MY SECOND BRINGS,
      BEHOLD HIM THERE, THE MONARCH OF THE SEAS!

    BUT AH! UNITED, WHAT REVERSE WE HAVE!
      MAN'S BOASTED POWER AND FREEDOM, ALL ARE FLOWN;
    LORD OF THE EARTH AND SEA, HE BENDS A SLAVE,
      AND WOMAN, LOVELY WOMAN, REIGNS ALONE.

      THY READY WIT THE WORD WILL SOON SUPPLY,
      MAY ITS APPROVAL BEAM IN THAT SOFT EYE!

SHE CAST HER EYE OVER IT, PONDERED, CAUGHT THE MEANING, READ IT THROUGH
AGAIN TO BE QUITE CERTAIN, AND QUITE MISTRESS OF THE LINES, AND THEN
PASSING IT TO HARRIET, SAT HAPPILY SMILING, AND SAYING TO HERSELF, WHILE
HARRIET WAS PUZZLING OVER THE PAPER IN ALL THE CONFUSION OF HOPE AND
DULNESS, "VERY WELL, MR. ELTON, VERY WELL INDEED. I HAVE READ WORSE
CHARADES. COURTSHIP--A VERY GOOD HINT. I GIVE YOU CREDIT FOR IT. THIS
IS FEELING YOUR WAY. THIS IS SAYING VERY PLAINLY--'PRAY, MISS SMITH,
GIVE ME LEAVE TO PAY MY ADDRESSES TO YOU. APPROVE MY CHARADE AND MY
INTENTIONS IN THE SAME GLANCE.'

      MAY ITS APPROVAL BEAM IN THAT SOFT EYE!

HARRIET EXACTLY. SOFT IS THE VERY WORD FOR HER EYE--OF ALL EPITHETS, THE
JUSTEST THAT COULD BE GIVEN.

      THY READY WIT THE WORD WILL SOON SUPPLY.

HUMPH--HARRIET'S READY WIT! ALL THE BETTER. A MAN MUST BE VERY MUCH IN
LOVE, INDEED, TO DESCRIBE HER SO. AH! MR. KNIGHTLEY, I WISH YOU HAD THE
BENEFIT OF THIS; I THINK THIS WOULD CONVINCE YOU. FOR ONCE IN YOUR LIFE
YOU WOULD BE OBLIGED TO OWN YOURSELF MISTAKEN. AN EXCELLENT CHARADE
INDEED! AND VERY MUCH TO THE PURPOSE. THINGS MUST COME TO A CRISIS SOON
NOW."

SHE WAS OBLIGED TO BREAK OFF FROM THESE VERY PLEASANT OBSERVATIONS,
WHICH WERE OTHERWISE OF A SORT TO RUN INTO GREAT LENGTH, BY THE
EAGERNESS OF HARRIET'S WONDERING QUESTIONS.

"WHAT CAN IT BE, MISS WOODHOUSE?--WHAT CAN IT BE? I HAVE NOT AN IDEA--I
CANNOT GUESS IT IN THE LEAST. WHAT CAN IT POSSIBLY BE? DO TRY TO FIND
IT OUT, MISS WOODHOUSE. DO HELP ME. I NEVER SAW ANY THING SO HARD. IS IT
KINGDOM? I WONDER WHO THE FRIEND WAS--AND WHO COULD BE THE YOUNG LADY.
DO YOU THINK IT IS A GOOD ONE? CAN IT BE WOMAN?

      AND WOMAN, LOVELY WOMAN, REIGNS ALONE.

CAN IT BE NEPTUNE?

      BEHOLD HIM THERE, THE MONARCH OF THE SEAS!

OR A TRIDENT? OR A MERMAID? OR A SHARK? OH, NO! SHARK IS ONLY ONE
SYLLABLE. IT MUST BE VERY CLEVER, OR HE WOULD NOT HAVE BROUGHT IT. OH!
MISS WOODHOUSE, DO YOU THINK WE SHALL EVER FIND IT OUT?"

"MERMAIDS AND SHARKS! NONSENSE! MY DEAR HARRIET, WHAT ARE YOU THINKING
OF? WHERE WOULD BE THE USE OF HIS BRINGING US A CHARADE MADE BY A FRIEND
UPON A MERMAID OR A SHARK? GIVE ME THE PAPER AND LISTEN.

FOR MISS ------, READ MISS SMITH.

    MY FIRST DISPLAYS THE WEALTH AND POMP OF KINGS,
      LORDS OF THE EARTH! THEIR LUXURY AND EASE.

THAT IS COURT.

    ANOTHER VIEW OF MAN, MY SECOND BRINGS;
      BEHOLD HIM THERE, THE MONARCH OF THE SEAS!

THAT IS SHIP;--PLAIN AS IT CAN BE.--NOW FOR THE CREAM.

    BUT AH! UNITED, (COURTSHIP, YOU KNOW,) WHAT REVERSE WE HAVE!
      MAN'S BOASTED POWER AND FREEDOM, ALL ARE FLOWN.
    LORD OF THE EARTH AND SEA, HE BENDS A SLAVE,
      AND WOMAN, LOVELY WOMAN, REIGNS ALONE.

A VERY PROPER COMPLIMENT!--AND THEN FOLLOWS THE APPLICATION, WHICH
I THINK, MY DEAR HARRIET, YOU CANNOT FIND MUCH DIFFICULTY IN
COMPREHENDING. READ IT IN COMFORT TO YOURSELF. THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT OF
ITS BEING WRITTEN FOR YOU AND TO YOU."

HARRIET COULD NOT LONG RESIST SO DELIGHTFUL A PERSUASION. SHE READ
THE CONCLUDING LINES, AND WAS ALL FLUTTER AND HAPPINESS. SHE COULD NOT
SPEAK. BUT SHE WAS NOT WANTED TO SPEAK. IT WAS ENOUGH FOR HER TO FEEL.
EMMA SPOKE FOR HER.

"THERE IS SO POINTED, AND SO PARTICULAR A MEANING IN THIS COMPLIMENT,"
SAID SHE, "THAT I CANNOT HAVE A DOUBT AS TO MR. ELTON'S INTENTIONS. YOU
ARE HIS OBJECT--AND YOU WILL SOON RECEIVE THE COMPLETEST PROOF OF IT. I
THOUGHT IT MUST BE SO. I THOUGHT I COULD NOT BE SO DECEIVED; BUT NOW, IT
IS CLEAR; THE STATE OF HIS MIND IS AS CLEAR AND DECIDED, AS MY WISHES ON
THE SUBJECT HAVE BEEN EVER SINCE I KNEW YOU. YES, HARRIET, JUST SO LONG
HAVE I BEEN WANTING THE VERY CIRCUMSTANCE TO HAPPEN WHAT HAS HAPPENED.
I COULD NEVER TELL WHETHER AN ATTACHMENT BETWEEN YOU AND MR. ELTON WERE
MOST DESIRABLE OR MOST NATURAL. ITS PROBABILITY AND ITS ELIGIBILITY HAVE
REALLY SO EQUALLED EACH OTHER! I AM VERY HAPPY. I CONGRATULATE YOU, MY
DEAR HARRIET, WITH ALL MY HEART. THIS IS AN ATTACHMENT WHICH A WOMAN MAY
WELL FEEL PRIDE IN CREATING. THIS IS A CONNEXION WHICH OFFERS NOTHING
BUT GOOD. IT WILL GIVE YOU EVERY THING THAT YOU WANT--CONSIDERATION,
INDEPENDENCE, A PROPER HOME--IT WILL FIX YOU IN THE CENTRE OF ALL YOUR
REAL FRIENDS, CLOSE TO HARTFIELD AND TO ME, AND CONFIRM OUR INTIMACY
FOR EVER. THIS, HARRIET, IS AN ALLIANCE WHICH CAN NEVER RAISE A BLUSH IN
EITHER OF US."

"DEAR MISS WOODHOUSE!"--AND "DEAR MISS WOODHOUSE," WAS ALL THAT HARRIET,
WITH MANY TENDER EMBRACES COULD ARTICULATE AT FIRST; BUT WHEN THEY DID
ARRIVE AT SOMETHING MORE LIKE CONVERSATION, IT WAS SUFFICIENTLY CLEAR TO
HER FRIEND THAT SHE SAW, FELT, ANTICIPATED, AND REMEMBERED JUST AS SHE
OUGHT. MR. ELTON'S SUPERIORITY HAD VERY AMPLE ACKNOWLEDGMENT.

"WHATEVER YOU SAY IS ALWAYS RIGHT," CRIED HARRIET, "AND THEREFORE I
SUPPOSE, AND BELIEVE, AND HOPE IT MUST BE SO; BUT OTHERWISE I COULD NOT
HAVE IMAGINED IT. IT IS SO MUCH BEYOND ANY THING I DESERVE. MR. ELTON,
WHO MIGHT MARRY ANY BODY! THERE CANNOT BE TWO OPINIONS ABOUT HIM. HE
IS SO VERY SUPERIOR. ONLY THINK OF THOSE SWEET VERSES--'TO MISS ------.'
DEAR ME, HOW CLEVER!--COULD IT REALLY BE MEANT FOR ME?"

"I CANNOT MAKE A QUESTION, OR LISTEN TO A QUESTION ABOUT THAT. IT IS A
CERTAINTY. RECEIVE IT ON MY JUDGMENT. IT IS A SORT OF PROLOGUE TO
THE PLAY, A MOTTO TO THE CHAPTER; AND WILL BE SOON FOLLOWED BY
MATTER-OF-FACT PROSE."

"IT IS A SORT OF THING WHICH NOBODY COULD HAVE EXPECTED. I AM SURE,
A MONTH AGO, I HAD NO MORE IDEA MYSELF!--THE STRANGEST THINGS DO TAKE
PLACE!"

"WHEN MISS SMITHS AND MR. ELTONS GET ACQUAINTED--THEY DO INDEED--AND
REALLY IT IS STRANGE; IT IS OUT OF THE COMMON COURSE THAT WHAT IS SO
EVIDENTLY, SO PALPABLY DESIRABLE--WHAT COURTS THE PRE-ARRANGEMENT OF
OTHER PEOPLE, SHOULD SO IMMEDIATELY SHAPE ITSELF INTO THE PROPER FORM.
YOU AND MR. ELTON ARE BY SITUATION CALLED TOGETHER; YOU BELONG TO ONE
ANOTHER BY EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE OF YOUR RESPECTIVE HOMES. YOUR MARRYING
WILL BE EQUAL TO THE MATCH AT RANDALLS. THERE DOES SEEM TO BE A
SOMETHING IN THE AIR OF HARTFIELD WHICH GIVES LOVE EXACTLY THE RIGHT
DIRECTION, AND SENDS IT INTO THE VERY CHANNEL WHERE IT OUGHT TO FLOW.

      THE COURSE OF TRUE LOVE NEVER DID RUN SMOOTH--

A HARTFIELD EDITION OF SHAKESPEARE WOULD HAVE A LONG NOTE ON THAT
PASSAGE."

"THAT MR. ELTON SHOULD REALLY BE IN LOVE WITH ME,--ME, OF ALL PEOPLE,
WHO DID NOT KNOW HIM, TO SPEAK TO HIM, AT MICHAELMAS! AND HE, THE VERY
HANDSOMEST MAN THAT EVER WAS, AND A MAN THAT EVERY BODY LOOKS UP TO,
QUITE LIKE MR. KNIGHTLEY! HIS COMPANY SO SOUGHT AFTER, THAT EVERY BODY
SAYS HE NEED NOT EAT A SINGLE MEAL BY HIMSELF IF HE DOES NOT CHUSE IT;
THAT HE HAS MORE INVITATIONS THAN THERE ARE DAYS IN THE WEEK. AND SO
EXCELLENT IN THE CHURCH! MISS NASH HAS PUT DOWN ALL THE TEXTS HE HAS
EVER PREACHED FROM SINCE HE CAME TO HIGHBURY. DEAR ME! WHEN I LOOK BACK
TO THE FIRST TIME I SAW HIM! HOW LITTLE DID I THINK!--THE TWO ABBOTS AND
I RAN INTO THE FRONT ROOM AND PEEPED THROUGH THE BLIND WHEN WE HEARD HE
WAS GOING BY, AND MISS NASH CAME AND SCOLDED US AWAY, AND STAID TO LOOK
THROUGH HERSELF; HOWEVER, SHE CALLED ME BACK PRESENTLY, AND LET ME
LOOK TOO, WHICH WAS VERY GOOD-NATURED. AND HOW BEAUTIFUL WE THOUGHT HE
LOOKED! HE WAS ARM-IN-ARM WITH MR. COLE."

"THIS IS AN ALLIANCE WHICH, WHOEVER--WHATEVER YOUR FRIENDS MAY BE, MUST
BE AGREEABLE TO THEM, PROVIDED AT LEAST THEY HAVE COMMON SENSE; AND WE
ARE NOT TO BE ADDRESSING OUR CONDUCT TO FOOLS. IF THEY ARE ANXIOUS TO
SEE YOU HAPPILY MARRIED, HERE IS A MAN WHOSE AMIABLE CHARACTER GIVES
EVERY ASSURANCE OF IT;--IF THEY WISH TO HAVE YOU SETTLED IN THE SAME
COUNTRY AND CIRCLE WHICH THEY HAVE CHOSEN TO PLACE YOU IN, HERE IT WILL
BE ACCOMPLISHED; AND IF THEIR ONLY OBJECT IS THAT YOU SHOULD, IN THE
COMMON PHRASE, BE WELL MARRIED, HERE IS THE COMFORTABLE FORTUNE, THE
RESPECTABLE ESTABLISHMENT, THE RISE IN THE WORLD WHICH MUST SATISFY
THEM."

"YES, VERY TRUE. HOW NICELY YOU TALK; I LOVE TO HEAR YOU. YOU UNDERSTAND
EVERY THING. YOU AND MR. ELTON ARE ONE AS CLEVER AS THE OTHER. THIS
CHARADE!--IF I HAD STUDIED A TWELVEMONTH, I COULD NEVER HAVE MADE ANY
THING LIKE IT."

"I THOUGHT HE MEANT TO TRY HIS SKILL, BY HIS MANNER OF DECLINING IT
YESTERDAY."

"I DO THINK IT IS, WITHOUT EXCEPTION, THE BEST CHARADE I EVER READ."

"I NEVER READ ONE MORE TO THE PURPOSE, CERTAINLY."

"IT IS AS LONG AGAIN AS ALMOST ALL WE HAVE HAD BEFORE."

"I DO NOT CONSIDER ITS LENGTH AS PARTICULARLY IN ITS FAVOUR. SUCH THINGS
IN GENERAL CANNOT BE TOO SHORT."

HARRIET WAS TOO INTENT ON THE LINES TO HEAR. THE MOST SATISFACTORY
COMPARISONS WERE RISING IN HER MIND.

"IT IS ONE THING," SAID SHE, PRESENTLY--HER CHEEKS IN A GLOW--"TO HAVE
VERY GOOD SENSE IN A COMMON WAY, LIKE EVERY BODY ELSE, AND IF THERE IS
ANY THING TO SAY, TO SIT DOWN AND WRITE A LETTER, AND SAY JUST WHAT YOU
MUST, IN A SHORT WAY; AND ANOTHER, TO WRITE VERSES AND CHARADES LIKE
THIS."

EMMA COULD NOT HAVE DESIRED A MORE SPIRITED REJECTION OF MR. MARTIN'S
PROSE.

"SUCH SWEET LINES!" CONTINUED HARRIET--"THESE TWO LAST!--BUT HOW SHALL I
EVER BE ABLE TO RETURN THE PAPER, OR SAY I HAVE FOUND IT OUT?--OH! MISS
WOODHOUSE, WHAT CAN WE DO ABOUT THAT?"

"LEAVE IT TO ME. YOU DO NOTHING. HE WILL BE HERE THIS EVENING, I DARE
SAY, AND THEN I WILL GIVE IT HIM BACK, AND SOME NONSENSE OR OTHER WILL
PASS BETWEEN US, AND YOU SHALL NOT BE COMMITTED.--YOUR SOFT EYES SHALL
CHUSE THEIR OWN TIME FOR BEAMING. TRUST TO ME."

"OH! MISS WOODHOUSE, WHAT A PITY THAT I MUST NOT WRITE THIS BEAUTIFUL
CHARADE INTO MY BOOK! I AM SURE I HAVE NOT GOT ONE HALF SO GOOD."

"LEAVE OUT THE TWO LAST LINES, AND THERE IS NO REASON WHY YOU SHOULD NOT
WRITE IT INTO YOUR BOOK."

"OH! BUT THOSE TWO LINES ARE"--

--"THE BEST OF ALL. GRANTED;--FOR PRIVATE ENJOYMENT; AND FOR PRIVATE
ENJOYMENT KEEP THEM. THEY ARE NOT AT ALL THE LESS WRITTEN YOU KNOW,
BECAUSE YOU DIVIDE THEM. THE COUPLET DOES NOT CEASE TO BE, NOR DOES ITS
MEANING CHANGE. BUT TAKE IT AWAY, AND ALL APPROPRIATION CEASES, AND A
VERY PRETTY GALLANT CHARADE REMAINS, FIT FOR ANY COLLECTION. DEPEND UPON
IT, HE WOULD NOT LIKE TO HAVE HIS CHARADE SLIGHTED, MUCH BETTER THAN HIS
PASSION. A POET IN LOVE MUST BE ENCOURAGED IN BOTH CAPACITIES, OR
NEITHER. GIVE ME THE BOOK, I WILL WRITE IT DOWN, AND THEN THERE CAN BE
NO POSSIBLE REFLECTION ON YOU."

HARRIET SUBMITTED, THOUGH HER MIND COULD HARDLY SEPARATE THE PARTS,
SO AS TO FEEL QUITE SURE THAT HER FRIEND WERE NOT WRITING DOWN A
DECLARATION OF LOVE. IT SEEMED TOO PRECIOUS AN OFFERING FOR ANY DEGREE
OF PUBLICITY.

"I SHALL NEVER LET THAT BOOK GO OUT OF MY OWN HANDS," SAID SHE.

"VERY WELL," REPLIED EMMA; "A MOST NATURAL FEELING; AND THE LONGER IT
LASTS, THE BETTER I SHALL BE PLEASED. BUT HERE IS MY FATHER COMING: YOU
WILL NOT OBJECT TO MY READING THE CHARADE TO HIM. IT WILL BE GIVING HIM
SO MUCH PLEASURE! HE LOVES ANY THING OF THE SORT, AND ESPECIALLY ANY
THING THAT PAYS WOMAN A COMPLIMENT. HE HAS THE TENDEREST SPIRIT OF
GALLANTRY TOWARDS US ALL!--YOU MUST LET ME READ IT TO HIM."

HARRIET LOOKED GRAVE.

"MY DEAR HARRIET, YOU MUST NOT REFINE TOO MUCH UPON THIS CHARADE.--YOU
WILL BETRAY YOUR FEELINGS IMPROPERLY, IF YOU ARE TOO CONSCIOUS AND TOO
QUICK, AND APPEAR TO AFFIX MORE MEANING, OR EVEN QUITE ALL THE MEANING
WHICH MAY BE AFFIXED TO IT. DO NOT BE OVERPOWERED BY SUCH A LITTLE
TRIBUTE OF ADMIRATION. IF HE HAD BEEN ANXIOUS FOR SECRECY, HE WOULD NOT
HAVE LEFT THE PAPER WHILE I WAS BY; BUT HE RATHER PUSHED IT TOWARDS ME
THAN TOWARDS YOU. DO NOT LET US BE TOO SOLEMN ON THE BUSINESS. HE HAS
ENCOURAGEMENT ENOUGH TO PROCEED, WITHOUT OUR SIGHING OUT OUR SOULS OVER
THIS CHARADE."

"OH! NO--I HOPE I SHALL NOT BE RIDICULOUS ABOUT IT. DO AS YOU PLEASE."

MR. WOODHOUSE CAME IN, AND VERY SOON LED TO THE SUBJECT AGAIN, BY THE
RECURRENCE OF HIS VERY FREQUENT INQUIRY OF "WELL, MY DEARS, HOW DOES
YOUR BOOK GO ON?--HAVE YOU GOT ANY THING FRESH?"

"YES, PAPA; WE HAVE SOMETHING TO READ YOU, SOMETHING QUITE FRESH. A
PIECE OF PAPER WAS FOUND ON THE TABLE THIS MORNING--(DROPT, WE SUPPOSE,
BY A FAIRY)--CONTAINING A VERY PRETTY CHARADE, AND WE HAVE JUST COPIED
IT IN."

SHE READ IT TO HIM, JUST AS HE LIKED TO HAVE ANY THING READ, SLOWLY AND
DISTINCTLY, AND TWO OR THREE TIMES OVER, WITH EXPLANATIONS OF EVERY
PART AS SHE PROCEEDED--AND HE WAS VERY MUCH PLEASED, AND, AS SHE HAD
FORESEEN, ESPECIALLY STRUCK WITH THE COMPLIMENTARY CONCLUSION.

"AYE, THAT'S VERY JUST, INDEED, THAT'S VERY PROPERLY SAID. VERY TRUE.
'WOMAN, LOVELY WOMAN.' IT IS SUCH A PRETTY CHARADE, MY DEAR, THAT I
CAN EASILY GUESS WHAT FAIRY BROUGHT IT.--NOBODY COULD HAVE WRITTEN SO
PRETTILY, BUT YOU, EMMA."

EMMA ONLY NODDED, AND SMILED.--AFTER A LITTLE THINKING, AND A VERY
TENDER SIGH, HE ADDED,

"AH! IT IS NO DIFFICULTY TO SEE WHO YOU TAKE AFTER! YOUR DEAR MOTHER
WAS SO CLEVER AT ALL THOSE THINGS! IF I HAD BUT HER MEMORY! BUT I CAN
REMEMBER NOTHING;--NOT EVEN THAT PARTICULAR RIDDLE WHICH YOU HAVE
HEARD ME MENTION; I CAN ONLY RECOLLECT THE FIRST STANZA; AND THERE ARE
SEVERAL.

    KITTY, A FAIR BUT FROZEN MAID,
      KINDLED A FLAME I YET DEPLORE,
    THE HOOD-WINK'D BOY I CALLED TO AID,
    THOUGH OF HIS NEAR APPROACH AFRAID,
      SO FATAL TO MY SUIT BEFORE.

AND THAT IS ALL THAT I CAN RECOLLECT OF IT--BUT IT IS VERY CLEVER ALL
THE WAY THROUGH. BUT I THINK, MY DEAR, YOU SAID YOU HAD GOT IT."

"YES, PAPA, IT IS WRITTEN OUT IN OUR SECOND PAGE. WE COPIED IT FROM THE
ELEGANT EXTRACTS. IT WAS GARRICK'S, YOU KNOW."

"AYE, VERY TRUE.--I WISH I COULD RECOLLECT MORE OF IT.

    KITTY, A FAIR BUT FROZEN MAID.

THE NAME MAKES ME THINK OF POOR ISABELLA; FOR SHE WAS VERY NEAR BEING
CHRISTENED CATHERINE AFTER HER GRANDMAMA. I HOPE WE SHALL HAVE HER HERE
NEXT WEEK. HAVE YOU THOUGHT, MY DEAR, WHERE YOU SHALL PUT HER--AND WHAT
ROOM THERE WILL BE FOR THE CHILDREN?"

"OH! YES--SHE WILL HAVE HER OWN ROOM, OF COURSE; THE ROOM SHE ALWAYS
HAS;--AND THERE IS THE NURSERY FOR THE CHILDREN,--JUST AS USUAL, YOU
KNOW. WHY SHOULD THERE BE ANY CHANGE?"

"I DO NOT KNOW, MY DEAR--BUT IT IS SO LONG SINCE SHE WAS HERE!--NOT
SINCE LAST EASTER, AND THEN ONLY FOR A FEW DAYS.--MR. JOHN KNIGHTLEY'S
BEING A LAWYER IS VERY INCONVENIENT.--POOR ISABELLA!--SHE IS SADLY TAKEN
AWAY FROM US ALL!--AND HOW SORRY SHE WILL BE WHEN SHE COMES, NOT TO SEE
MISS TAYLOR HERE!"

"SHE WILL NOT BE SURPRIZED, PAPA, AT LEAST."

"I DO NOT KNOW, MY DEAR. I AM SURE I WAS VERY MUCH SURPRIZED WHEN I
FIRST HEARD SHE WAS GOING TO BE MARRIED."

"WE MUST ASK MR. AND MRS. WESTON TO DINE WITH US, WHILE ISABELLA IS
HERE."

"YES, MY DEAR, IF THERE IS TIME.--BUT--(IN A VERY DEPRESSED TONE)--SHE
IS COMING FOR ONLY ONE WEEK. THERE WILL NOT BE TIME FOR ANY THING."

"IT IS UNFORTUNATE THAT THEY CANNOT STAY LONGER--BUT IT SEEMS A CASE OF
NECESSITY. MR. JOHN KNIGHTLEY MUST BE IN TOWN AGAIN ON THE 28TH, AND WE
OUGHT TO BE THANKFUL, PAPA, THAT WE ARE TO HAVE THE WHOLE OF THE TIME
THEY CAN GIVE TO THE COUNTRY, THAT TWO OR THREE DAYS ARE NOT TO BE TAKEN
OUT FOR THE ABBEY. MR. KNIGHTLEY PROMISES TO GIVE UP HIS CLAIM THIS
CHRISTMAS--THOUGH YOU KNOW IT IS LONGER SINCE THEY WERE WITH HIM, THAN
WITH US."

"IT WOULD BE VERY HARD, INDEED, MY DEAR, IF POOR ISABELLA WERE TO BE
ANYWHERE BUT AT HARTFIELD."

MR. WOODHOUSE COULD NEVER ALLOW FOR MR. KNIGHTLEY'S CLAIMS ON HIS
BROTHER, OR ANY BODY'S CLAIMS ON ISABELLA, EXCEPT HIS OWN. HE SAT MUSING
A LITTLE WHILE, AND THEN SAID,

"BUT I DO NOT SEE WHY POOR ISABELLA SHOULD BE OBLIGED TO GO BACK SO
SOON, THOUGH HE DOES. I THINK, EMMA, I SHALL TRY AND PERSUADE HER TO
STAY LONGER WITH US. SHE AND THE CHILDREN MIGHT STAY VERY WELL."

"AH! PAPA--THAT IS WHAT YOU NEVER HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH, AND I
DO NOT THINK YOU EVER WILL. ISABELLA CANNOT BEAR TO STAY BEHIND HER
HUSBAND."

THIS WAS TOO TRUE FOR CONTRADICTION. UNWELCOME AS IT WAS, MR. WOODHOUSE
COULD ONLY GIVE A SUBMISSIVE SIGH; AND AS EMMA SAW HIS SPIRITS AFFECTED
BY THE IDEA OF HIS DAUGHTER'S ATTACHMENT TO HER HUSBAND, SHE IMMEDIATELY
LED TO SUCH A BRANCH OF THE SUBJECT AS MUST RAISE THEM.

"HARRIET MUST GIVE US AS MUCH OF HER COMPANY AS SHE CAN WHILE MY BROTHER
AND SISTER ARE HERE. I AM SURE SHE WILL BE PLEASED WITH THE CHILDREN.
WE ARE VERY PROUD OF THE CHILDREN, ARE NOT WE, PAPA? I WONDER WHICH SHE
WILL THINK THE HANDSOMEST, HENRY OR JOHN?"

"AYE, I WONDER WHICH SHE WILL. POOR LITTLE DEARS, HOW GLAD THEY WILL BE
TO COME. THEY ARE VERY FOND OF BEING AT HARTFIELD, HARRIET."

"I DARE SAY THEY ARE, SIR. I AM SURE I DO NOT KNOW WHO IS NOT."

"HENRY IS A FINE BOY, BUT JOHN IS VERY LIKE HIS MAMA. HENRY IS THE
ELDEST, HE WAS NAMED AFTER ME, NOT AFTER HIS FATHER. JOHN, THE SECOND,
IS NAMED AFTER HIS FATHER. SOME PEOPLE ARE SURPRIZED, I BELIEVE, THAT
THE ELDEST WAS NOT, BUT ISABELLA WOULD HAVE HIM CALLED HENRY, WHICH I
THOUGHT VERY PRETTY OF HER. AND HE IS A VERY CLEVER BOY, INDEED. THEY
ARE ALL REMARKABLY CLEVER; AND THEY HAVE SO MANY PRETTY WAYS. THEY WILL
COME AND STAND BY MY CHAIR, AND SAY, 'GRANDPAPA, CAN YOU GIVE ME A BIT
OF STRING?' AND ONCE HENRY ASKED ME FOR A KNIFE, BUT I TOLD HIM KNIVES
WERE ONLY MADE FOR GRANDPAPAS. I THINK THEIR FATHER IS TOO ROUGH WITH
THEM VERY OFTEN."

"HE APPEARS ROUGH TO YOU," SAID EMMA, "BECAUSE YOU ARE SO VERY GENTLE
YOURSELF; BUT IF YOU COULD COMPARE HIM WITH OTHER PAPAS, YOU WOULD NOT
THINK HIM ROUGH. HE WISHES HIS BOYS TO BE ACTIVE AND HARDY; AND IF
THEY MISBEHAVE, CAN GIVE THEM A SHARP WORD NOW AND THEN; BUT HE IS AN
AFFECTIONATE FATHER--CERTAINLY MR. JOHN KNIGHTLEY IS AN AFFECTIONATE
FATHER. THE CHILDREN ARE ALL FOND OF HIM."

"AND THEN THEIR UNCLE COMES IN, AND TOSSES THEM UP TO THE CEILING IN A
VERY FRIGHTFUL WAY!"

"BUT THEY LIKE IT, PAPA; THERE IS NOTHING THEY LIKE SO MUCH. IT IS SUCH
ENJOYMENT TO THEM, THAT IF THEIR UNCLE DID NOT LAY DOWN THE RULE OF
THEIR TAKING TURNS, WHICHEVER BEGAN WOULD NEVER GIVE WAY TO THE OTHER."

"WELL, I CANNOT UNDERSTAND IT."

"THAT IS THE CASE WITH US ALL, PAPA. ONE HALF OF THE WORLD CANNOT
UNDERSTAND THE PLEASURES OF THE OTHER."

LATER IN THE MORNING, AND JUST AS THE GIRLS WERE GOING TO SEPARATE
IN PREPARATION FOR THE REGULAR FOUR O'CLOCK DINNER, THE HERO OF THIS
INIMITABLE CHARADE WALKED IN AGAIN. HARRIET TURNED AWAY; BUT EMMA COULD
RECEIVE HIM WITH THE USUAL SMILE, AND HER QUICK EYE SOON DISCERNED IN
HIS THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF HAVING MADE A PUSH--OF HAVING THROWN A DIE;
AND SHE IMAGINED HE WAS COME TO SEE HOW IT MIGHT TURN UP. HIS OSTENSIBLE
REASON, HOWEVER, WAS TO ASK WHETHER MR. WOODHOUSE'S PARTY COULD BE MADE
UP IN THE EVENING WITHOUT HIM, OR WHETHER HE SHOULD BE IN THE SMALLEST
DEGREE NECESSARY AT HARTFIELD. IF HE WERE, EVERY THING ELSE MUST GIVE
WAY; BUT OTHERWISE HIS FRIEND COLE HAD BEEN SAYING SO MUCH ABOUT HIS
DINING WITH HIM--HAD MADE SUCH A POINT OF IT, THAT HE HAD PROMISED HIM
CONDITIONALLY TO COME.

EMMA THANKED HIM, BUT COULD NOT ALLOW OF HIS DISAPPOINTING HIS FRIEND
ON THEIR ACCOUNT; HER FATHER WAS SURE OF HIS RUBBER. HE RE-URGED--SHE
RE-DECLINED; AND HE SEEMED THEN ABOUT TO MAKE HIS BOW, WHEN TAKING THE
PAPER FROM THE TABLE, SHE RETURNED IT--

"OH! HERE IS THE CHARADE YOU WERE SO OBLIGING AS TO LEAVE WITH US; THANK
YOU FOR THE SIGHT OF IT. WE ADMIRED IT SO MUCH, THAT I HAVE VENTURED
TO WRITE IT INTO MISS SMITH'S COLLECTION. YOUR FRIEND WILL NOT TAKE IT
AMISS I HOPE. OF COURSE I HAVE NOT TRANSCRIBED BEYOND THE FIRST EIGHT
LINES."

MR. ELTON CERTAINLY DID NOT VERY WELL KNOW WHAT TO SAY. HE LOOKED RATHER
DOUBTINGLY--RATHER CONFUSED; SAID SOMETHING ABOUT "HONOUR,"--GLANCED AT
EMMA AND AT HARRIET, AND THEN SEEING THE BOOK OPEN ON THE TABLE, TOOK
IT UP, AND EXAMINED IT VERY ATTENTIVELY. WITH THE VIEW OF PASSING OFF AN
AWKWARD MOMENT, EMMA SMILINGLY SAID,

"YOU MUST MAKE MY APOLOGIES TO YOUR FRIEND; BUT SO GOOD A CHARADE
MUST NOT BE CONFINED TO ONE OR TWO. HE MAY BE SURE OF EVERY WOMAN'S
APPROBATION WHILE HE WRITES WITH SUCH GALLANTRY."

"I HAVE NO HESITATION IN SAYING," REPLIED MR. ELTON, THOUGH HESITATING
A GOOD DEAL WHILE HE SPOKE; "I HAVE NO HESITATION IN SAYING--AT LEAST
IF MY FRIEND FEELS AT ALL AS I DO--I HAVE NOT THE SMALLEST DOUBT THAT,
COULD HE SEE HIS LITTLE EFFUSION HONOURED AS I SEE IT, (LOOKING AT THE
BOOK AGAIN, AND REPLACING IT ON THE TABLE), HE WOULD CONSIDER IT AS THE
PROUDEST MOMENT OF HIS LIFE."

AFTER THIS SPEECH HE WAS GONE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. EMMA COULD NOT THINK
IT TOO SOON; FOR WITH ALL HIS GOOD AND AGREEABLE QUALITIES, THERE WAS
A SORT OF PARADE IN HIS SPEECHES WHICH WAS VERY APT TO INCLINE HER TO
LAUGH. SHE RAN AWAY TO INDULGE THE INCLINATION, LEAVING THE TENDER AND
THE SUBLIME OF PLEASURE TO HARRIET'S SHARE.



CHAPTER X


THOUGH NOW THE MIDDLE OF DECEMBER, THERE HAD YET BEEN NO WEATHER TO
PREVENT THE YOUNG LADIES FROM TOLERABLY REGULAR EXERCISE; AND ON THE
MORROW, EMMA HAD A CHARITABLE VISIT TO PAY TO A POOR SICK FAMILY, WHO
LIVED A LITTLE WAY OUT OF HIGHBURY.

THEIR ROAD TO THIS DETACHED COTTAGE WAS DOWN VICARAGE LANE, A LANE
LEADING AT RIGHT ANGLES FROM THE BROAD, THOUGH IRREGULAR, MAIN STREET OF
THE PLACE; AND, AS MAY BE INFERRED, CONTAINING THE BLESSED ABODE OF MR.
ELTON. A FEW INFERIOR DWELLINGS WERE FIRST TO BE PASSED, AND THEN, ABOUT
A QUARTER OF A MILE DOWN THE LANE ROSE THE VICARAGE, AN OLD AND NOT
VERY GOOD HOUSE, ALMOST AS CLOSE TO THE ROAD AS IT COULD BE. IT HAD
NO ADVANTAGE OF SITUATION; BUT HAD BEEN VERY MUCH SMARTENED UP BY THE
PRESENT PROPRIETOR; AND, SUCH AS IT WAS, THERE COULD BE NO POSSIBILITY
OF THE TWO FRIENDS PASSING IT WITHOUT A SLACKENED PACE AND OBSERVING
EYES.--EMMA'S REMARK WAS--

"THERE IT IS. THERE GO YOU AND YOUR RIDDLE-BOOK ONE OF THESE
DAYS."--HARRIET'S WAS--

"OH, WHAT A SWEET HOUSE!--HOW VERY BEAUTIFUL!--THERE ARE THE YELLOW
CURTAINS THAT MISS NASH ADMIRES SO MUCH."

"I DO NOT OFTEN WALK THIS WAY NOW," SAID EMMA, AS THEY PROCEEDED, "BUT
THEN THERE WILL BE AN INDUCEMENT, AND I SHALL GRADUALLY GET INTIMATELY
ACQUAINTED WITH ALL THE HEDGES, GATES, POOLS AND POLLARDS OF THIS PART
OF HIGHBURY."

HARRIET, SHE FOUND, HAD NEVER IN HER LIFE BEEN WITHIN SIDE THE VICARAGE,
AND HER CURIOSITY TO SEE IT WAS SO EXTREME, THAT, CONSIDERING EXTERIORS
AND PROBABILITIES, EMMA COULD ONLY CLASS IT, AS A PROOF OF LOVE, WITH
MR. ELTON'S SEEING READY WIT IN HER.

"I WISH WE COULD CONTRIVE IT," SAID SHE; "BUT I CANNOT THINK OF ANY
TOLERABLE PRETENCE FOR GOING IN;--NO SERVANT THAT I WANT TO INQUIRE
ABOUT OF HIS HOUSEKEEPER--NO MESSAGE FROM MY FATHER."

SHE PONDERED, BUT COULD THINK OF NOTHING. AFTER A MUTUAL SILENCE OF SOME
MINUTES, HARRIET THUS BEGAN AGAIN--

"I DO SO WONDER, MISS WOODHOUSE, THAT YOU SHOULD NOT BE MARRIED, OR
GOING TO BE MARRIED! SO CHARMING AS YOU ARE!"--

EMMA LAUGHED, AND REPLIED,

"MY BEING CHARMING, HARRIET, IS NOT QUITE ENOUGH TO INDUCE ME TO MARRY;
I MUST FIND OTHER PEOPLE CHARMING--ONE OTHER PERSON AT LEAST. AND I
AM NOT ONLY, NOT GOING TO BE MARRIED, AT PRESENT, BUT HAVE VERY LITTLE
INTENTION OF EVER MARRYING AT ALL."

"AH!--SO YOU SAY; BUT I CANNOT BELIEVE IT."

"I MUST SEE SOMEBODY VERY SUPERIOR TO ANY ONE I HAVE SEEN YET, TO BE
TEMPTED; MR. ELTON, YOU KNOW, (RECOLLECTING HERSELF,) IS OUT OF THE
QUESTION: AND I DO NOT WISH TO SEE ANY SUCH PERSON. I WOULD RATHER NOT
BE TEMPTED. I CANNOT REALLY CHANGE FOR THE BETTER. IF I WERE TO MARRY, I
MUST EXPECT TO REPENT IT."

"DEAR ME!--IT IS SO ODD TO HEAR A WOMAN TALK SO!"--

"I HAVE NONE OF THE USUAL INDUCEMENTS OF WOMEN TO MARRY. WERE I TO FALL
IN LOVE, INDEED, IT WOULD BE A DIFFERENT THING! BUT I NEVER HAVE BEEN IN
LOVE; IT IS NOT MY WAY, OR MY NATURE; AND I DO NOT THINK I EVER SHALL.
AND, WITHOUT LOVE, I AM SURE I SHOULD BE A FOOL TO CHANGE SUCH A
SITUATION AS MINE. FORTUNE I DO NOT WANT; EMPLOYMENT I DO NOT WANT;
CONSEQUENCE I DO NOT WANT: I BELIEVE FEW MARRIED WOMEN ARE HALF AS MUCH
MISTRESS OF THEIR HUSBAND'S HOUSE AS I AM OF HARTFIELD; AND NEVER, NEVER
COULD I EXPECT TO BE SO TRULY BELOVED AND IMPORTANT; SO ALWAYS FIRST AND
ALWAYS RIGHT IN ANY MAN'S EYES AS I AM IN MY FATHER'S."

"BUT THEN, TO BE AN OLD MAID AT LAST, LIKE MISS BATES!"

"THAT IS AS FORMIDABLE AN IMAGE AS YOU COULD PRESENT, HARRIET; AND IF
I THOUGHT I SHOULD EVER BE LIKE MISS BATES! SO SILLY--SO SATISFIED--SO
SMILING--SO PROSING--SO UNDISTINGUISHING AND UNFASTIDIOUS--AND SO APT
TO TELL EVERY THING RELATIVE TO EVERY BODY ABOUT ME, I WOULD MARRY
TO-MORROW. BUT BETWEEN US, I AM CONVINCED THERE NEVER CAN BE ANY
LIKENESS, EXCEPT IN BEING UNMARRIED."

"BUT STILL, YOU WILL BE AN OLD MAID! AND THAT'S SO DREADFUL!"

"NEVER MIND, HARRIET, I SHALL NOT BE A POOR OLD MAID; AND IT IS POVERTY
ONLY WHICH MAKES CELIBACY CONTEMPTIBLE TO A GENEROUS PUBLIC! A SINGLE
WOMAN, WITH A VERY NARROW INCOME, MUST BE A RIDICULOUS, DISAGREEABLE OLD
MAID! THE PROPER SPORT OF BOYS AND GIRLS, BUT A SINGLE WOMAN, OF GOOD
FORTUNE, IS ALWAYS RESPECTABLE, AND MAY BE AS SENSIBLE AND PLEASANT
AS ANY BODY ELSE. AND THE DISTINCTION IS NOT QUITE SO MUCH AGAINST THE
CANDOUR AND COMMON SENSE OF THE WORLD AS APPEARS AT FIRST; FOR A VERY
NARROW INCOME HAS A TENDENCY TO CONTRACT THE MIND, AND SOUR THE TEMPER.
THOSE WHO CAN BARELY LIVE, AND WHO LIVE PERFORCE IN A VERY SMALL, AND
GENERALLY VERY INFERIOR, SOCIETY, MAY WELL BE ILLIBERAL AND CROSS. THIS
DOES NOT APPLY, HOWEVER, TO MISS BATES; SHE IS ONLY TOO GOOD NATURED AND
TOO SILLY TO SUIT ME; BUT, IN GENERAL, SHE IS VERY MUCH TO THE TASTE
OF EVERY BODY, THOUGH SINGLE AND THOUGH POOR. POVERTY CERTAINLY HAS NOT
CONTRACTED HER MIND: I REALLY BELIEVE, IF SHE HAD ONLY A SHILLING IN THE
WORLD, SHE WOULD BE VERY LIKELY TO GIVE AWAY SIXPENCE OF IT; AND NOBODY
IS AFRAID OF HER: THAT IS A GREAT CHARM."

"DEAR ME! BUT WHAT SHALL YOU DO? HOW SHALL YOU EMPLOY YOURSELF WHEN YOU
GROW OLD?"

"IF I KNOW MYSELF, HARRIET, MINE IS AN ACTIVE, BUSY MIND, WITH A GREAT
MANY INDEPENDENT RESOURCES; AND I DO NOT PERCEIVE WHY I SHOULD BE MORE
IN WANT OF EMPLOYMENT AT FORTY OR FIFTY THAN ONE-AND-TWENTY. WOMAN'S
USUAL OCCUPATIONS OF HAND AND MIND WILL BE AS OPEN TO ME THEN AS THEY
ARE NOW; OR WITH NO IMPORTANT VARIATION. IF I DRAW LESS, I SHALL READ
MORE; IF I GIVE UP MUSIC, I SHALL TAKE TO CARPET-WORK. AND AS FOR
OBJECTS OF INTEREST, OBJECTS FOR THE AFFECTIONS, WHICH IS IN TRUTH THE
GREAT POINT OF INFERIORITY, THE WANT OF WHICH IS REALLY THE GREAT EVIL
TO BE AVOIDED IN NOT MARRYING, I SHALL BE VERY WELL OFF, WITH ALL THE
CHILDREN OF A SISTER I LOVE SO MUCH, TO CARE ABOUT. THERE WILL BE ENOUGH
OF THEM, IN ALL PROBABILITY, TO SUPPLY EVERY SORT OF SENSATION THAT
DECLINING LIFE CAN NEED. THERE WILL BE ENOUGH FOR EVERY HOPE AND EVERY
FEAR; AND THOUGH MY ATTACHMENT TO NONE CAN EQUAL THAT OF A PARENT, IT
SUITS MY IDEAS OF COMFORT BETTER THAN WHAT IS WARMER AND BLINDER. MY
NEPHEWS AND NIECES!--I SHALL OFTEN HAVE A NIECE WITH ME."

"DO YOU KNOW MISS BATES'S NIECE? THAT IS, I KNOW YOU MUST HAVE SEEN HER
A HUNDRED TIMES--BUT ARE YOU ACQUAINTED?"

"OH! YES; WE ARE ALWAYS FORCED TO BE ACQUAINTED WHENEVER SHE COMES TO
HIGHBURY. BY THE BYE, THAT IS ALMOST ENOUGH TO PUT ONE OUT OF CONCEIT
WITH A NIECE. HEAVEN FORBID! AT LEAST, THAT I SHOULD EVER BORE PEOPLE
HALF SO MUCH ABOUT ALL THE KNIGHTLEYS TOGETHER, AS SHE DOES ABOUT JANE
FAIRFAX. ONE IS SICK OF THE VERY NAME OF JANE FAIRFAX. EVERY LETTER FROM
HER IS READ FORTY TIMES OVER; HER COMPLIMENTS TO ALL FRIENDS GO ROUND
AND ROUND AGAIN; AND IF SHE DOES BUT SEND HER AUNT THE PATTERN OF A
STOMACHER, OR KNIT A PAIR OF GARTERS FOR HER GRANDMOTHER, ONE HEARS OF
NOTHING ELSE FOR A MONTH. I WISH JANE FAIRFAX VERY WELL; BUT SHE TIRES
ME TO DEATH."

THEY WERE NOW APPROACHING THE COTTAGE, AND ALL IDLE TOPICS WERE
SUPERSEDED. EMMA WAS VERY COMPASSIONATE; AND THE DISTRESSES OF THE POOR
WERE AS SURE OF RELIEF FROM HER PERSONAL ATTENTION AND KINDNESS, HER
COUNSEL AND HER PATIENCE, AS FROM HER PURSE. SHE UNDERSTOOD THEIR WAYS,
COULD ALLOW FOR THEIR IGNORANCE AND THEIR TEMPTATIONS, HAD NO ROMANTIC
EXPECTATIONS OF EXTRAORDINARY VIRTUE FROM THOSE FOR WHOM EDUCATION HAD
DONE SO LITTLE; ENTERED INTO THEIR TROUBLES WITH READY SYMPATHY, AND
ALWAYS GAVE HER ASSISTANCE WITH AS MUCH INTELLIGENCE AS GOOD-WILL. IN
THE PRESENT INSTANCE, IT WAS SICKNESS AND POVERTY TOGETHER WHICH SHE
CAME TO VISIT; AND AFTER REMAINING THERE AS LONG AS SHE COULD GIVE
COMFORT OR ADVICE, SHE QUITTED THE COTTAGE WITH SUCH AN IMPRESSION OF
THE SCENE AS MADE HER SAY TO HARRIET, AS THEY WALKED AWAY,

"THESE ARE THE SIGHTS, HARRIET, TO DO ONE GOOD. HOW TRIFLING THEY MAKE
EVERY THING ELSE APPEAR!--I FEEL NOW AS IF I COULD THINK OF NOTHING BUT
THESE POOR CREATURES ALL THE REST OF THE DAY; AND YET, WHO CAN SAY HOW
SOON IT MAY ALL VANISH FROM MY MIND?"

"VERY TRUE," SAID HARRIET. "POOR CREATURES! ONE CAN THINK OF NOTHING
ELSE."

"AND REALLY, I DO NOT THINK THE IMPRESSION WILL SOON BE OVER," SAID
EMMA, AS SHE CROSSED THE LOW HEDGE, AND TOTTERING FOOTSTEP WHICH ENDED
THE NARROW, SLIPPERY PATH THROUGH THE COTTAGE GARDEN, AND BROUGHT THEM
INTO THE LANE AGAIN. "I DO NOT THINK IT WILL," STOPPING TO LOOK ONCE
MORE AT ALL THE OUTWARD WRETCHEDNESS OF THE PLACE, AND RECALL THE STILL
GREATER WITHIN.

"OH! DEAR, NO," SAID HER COMPANION.

THEY WALKED ON. THE LANE MADE A SLIGHT BEND; AND WHEN THAT BEND WAS
PASSED, MR. ELTON WAS IMMEDIATELY IN SIGHT; AND SO NEAR AS TO GIVE EMMA
TIME ONLY TO SAY FARTHER,

"AH! HARRIET, HERE COMES A VERY SUDDEN TRIAL OF OUR STABILITY IN GOOD
THOUGHTS. WELL, (SMILING,) I HOPE IT MAY BE ALLOWED THAT IF COMPASSION
HAS PRODUCED EXERTION AND RELIEF TO THE SUFFERERS, IT HAS DONE ALL THAT
IS TRULY IMPORTANT. IF WE FEEL FOR THE WRETCHED, ENOUGH TO DO ALL WE CAN
FOR THEM, THE REST IS EMPTY SYMPATHY, ONLY DISTRESSING TO OURSELVES."

HARRIET COULD JUST ANSWER, "OH! DEAR, YES," BEFORE THE GENTLEMAN JOINED
THEM. THE WANTS AND SUFFERINGS OF THE POOR FAMILY, HOWEVER, WERE THE
FIRST SUBJECT ON MEETING. HE HAD BEEN GOING TO CALL ON THEM. HIS VISIT
HE WOULD NOW DEFER; BUT THEY HAD A VERY INTERESTING PARLEY ABOUT
WHAT COULD BE DONE AND SHOULD BE DONE. MR. ELTON THEN TURNED BACK TO
ACCOMPANY THEM.

"TO FALL IN WITH EACH OTHER ON SUCH AN ERRAND AS THIS," THOUGHT EMMA;
"TO MEET IN A CHARITABLE SCHEME; THIS WILL BRING A GREAT INCREASE
OF LOVE ON EACH SIDE. I SHOULD NOT WONDER IF IT WERE TO BRING ON THE
DECLARATION. IT MUST, IF I WERE NOT HERE. I WISH I WERE ANYWHERE ELSE."

ANXIOUS TO SEPARATE HERSELF FROM THEM AS FAR AS SHE COULD, SHE SOON
AFTERWARDS TOOK POSSESSION OF A NARROW FOOTPATH, A LITTLE RAISED ON ONE
SIDE OF THE LANE, LEAVING THEM TOGETHER IN THE MAIN ROAD. BUT SHE HAD
NOT BEEN THERE TWO MINUTES WHEN SHE FOUND THAT HARRIET'S HABITS OF
DEPENDENCE AND IMITATION WERE BRINGING HER UP TOO, AND THAT, IN SHORT,
THEY WOULD BOTH BE SOON AFTER HER. THIS WOULD NOT DO; SHE IMMEDIATELY
STOPPED, UNDER PRETENCE OF HAVING SOME ALTERATION TO MAKE IN THE LACING
OF HER HALF-BOOT, AND STOOPING DOWN IN COMPLETE OCCUPATION OF THE
FOOTPATH, BEGGED THEM TO HAVE THE GOODNESS TO WALK ON, AND SHE WOULD
FOLLOW IN HALF A MINUTE. THEY DID AS THEY WERE DESIRED; AND BY THE TIME
SHE JUDGED IT REASONABLE TO HAVE DONE WITH HER BOOT, SHE HAD THE COMFORT
OF FARTHER DELAY IN HER POWER, BEING OVERTAKEN BY A CHILD FROM THE
COTTAGE, SETTING OUT, ACCORDING TO ORDERS, WITH HER PITCHER, TO FETCH
BROTH FROM HARTFIELD. TO WALK BY THE SIDE OF THIS CHILD, AND TALK TO
AND QUESTION HER, WAS THE MOST NATURAL THING IN THE WORLD, OR WOULD HAVE
BEEN THE MOST NATURAL, HAD SHE BEEN ACTING JUST THEN WITHOUT DESIGN;
AND BY THIS MEANS THE OTHERS WERE STILL ABLE TO KEEP AHEAD, WITHOUT
ANY OBLIGATION OF WAITING FOR HER. SHE GAINED ON THEM, HOWEVER,
INVOLUNTARILY: THE CHILD'S PACE WAS QUICK, AND THEIRS RATHER SLOW;
AND SHE WAS THE MORE CONCERNED AT IT, FROM THEIR BEING EVIDENTLY IN
A CONVERSATION WHICH INTERESTED THEM. MR. ELTON WAS SPEAKING WITH
ANIMATION, HARRIET LISTENING WITH A VERY PLEASED ATTENTION; AND EMMA,
HAVING SENT THE CHILD ON, WAS BEGINNING TO THINK HOW SHE MIGHT DRAW BACK
A LITTLE MORE, WHEN THEY BOTH LOOKED AROUND, AND SHE WAS OBLIGED TO JOIN
THEM.

MR. ELTON WAS STILL TALKING, STILL ENGAGED IN SOME INTERESTING DETAIL;
AND EMMA EXPERIENCED SOME DISAPPOINTMENT WHEN SHE FOUND THAT HE WAS ONLY
GIVING HIS FAIR COMPANION AN ACCOUNT OF THE YESTERDAY'S PARTY AT HIS
FRIEND COLE'S, AND THAT SHE WAS COME IN HERSELF FOR THE STILTON CHEESE,
THE NORTH WILTSHIRE, THE BUTTER, THE CELERY, THE BEET-ROOT, AND ALL THE
DESSERT.

"THIS WOULD SOON HAVE LED TO SOMETHING BETTER, OF COURSE," WAS HER
CONSOLING REFLECTION; "ANY THING INTERESTS BETWEEN THOSE WHO LOVE; AND
ANY THING WILL SERVE AS INTRODUCTION TO WHAT IS NEAR THE HEART. IF I
COULD BUT HAVE KEPT LONGER AWAY!"

THEY NOW WALKED ON TOGETHER QUIETLY, TILL WITHIN VIEW OF THE VICARAGE
PALES, WHEN A SUDDEN RESOLUTION, OF AT LEAST GETTING HARRIET INTO THE
HOUSE, MADE HER AGAIN FIND SOMETHING VERY MUCH AMISS ABOUT HER BOOT, AND
FALL BEHIND TO ARRANGE IT ONCE MORE. SHE THEN BROKE THE LACE OFF SHORT,
AND DEXTEROUSLY THROWING IT INTO A DITCH, WAS PRESENTLY OBLIGED TO
ENTREAT THEM TO STOP, AND ACKNOWLEDGED HER INABILITY TO PUT HERSELF TO
RIGHTS SO AS TO BE ABLE TO WALK HOME IN TOLERABLE COMFORT.

"PART OF MY LACE IS GONE," SAID SHE, "AND I DO NOT KNOW HOW I AM TO
CONTRIVE. I REALLY AM A MOST TROUBLESOME COMPANION TO YOU BOTH, BUT I
HOPE I AM NOT OFTEN SO ILL-EQUIPPED. MR. ELTON, I MUST BEG LEAVE TO STOP
AT YOUR HOUSE, AND ASK YOUR HOUSEKEEPER FOR A BIT OF RIBBAND OR STRING,
OR ANY THING JUST TO KEEP MY BOOT ON."

MR. ELTON LOOKED ALL HAPPINESS AT THIS PROPOSITION; AND NOTHING COULD
EXCEED HIS ALERTNESS AND ATTENTION IN CONDUCTING THEM INTO HIS HOUSE AND
ENDEAVOURING TO MAKE EVERY THING APPEAR TO ADVANTAGE. THE ROOM THEY WERE
TAKEN INTO WAS THE ONE HE CHIEFLY OCCUPIED, AND LOOKING FORWARDS; BEHIND
IT WAS ANOTHER WITH WHICH IT IMMEDIATELY COMMUNICATED; THE DOOR BETWEEN
THEM WAS OPEN, AND EMMA PASSED INTO IT WITH THE HOUSEKEEPER TO RECEIVE
HER ASSISTANCE IN THE MOST COMFORTABLE MANNER. SHE WAS OBLIGED TO LEAVE
THE DOOR AJAR AS SHE FOUND IT; BUT SHE FULLY INTENDED THAT MR. ELTON
SHOULD CLOSE IT. IT WAS NOT CLOSED, HOWEVER, IT STILL REMAINED AJAR; BUT
BY ENGAGING THE HOUSEKEEPER IN INCESSANT CONVERSATION, SHE HOPED TO MAKE
IT PRACTICABLE FOR HIM TO CHUSE HIS OWN SUBJECT IN THE ADJOINING
ROOM. FOR TEN MINUTES SHE COULD HEAR NOTHING BUT HERSELF. IT COULD BE
PROTRACTED NO LONGER. SHE WAS THEN OBLIGED TO BE FINISHED, AND MAKE HER
APPEARANCE.

THE LOVERS WERE STANDING TOGETHER AT ONE OF THE WINDOWS. IT HAD A MOST
FAVOURABLE ASPECT; AND, FOR HALF A MINUTE, EMMA FELT THE GLORY OF HAVING
SCHEMED SUCCESSFULLY. BUT IT WOULD NOT DO; HE HAD NOT COME TO THE POINT.
HE HAD BEEN MOST AGREEABLE, MOST DELIGHTFUL; HE HAD TOLD HARRIET THAT
HE HAD SEEN THEM GO BY, AND HAD PURPOSELY FOLLOWED THEM; OTHER LITTLE
GALLANTRIES AND ALLUSIONS HAD BEEN DROPT, BUT NOTHING SERIOUS.

"CAUTIOUS, VERY CAUTIOUS," THOUGHT EMMA; "HE ADVANCES INCH BY INCH, AND
WILL HAZARD NOTHING TILL HE BELIEVES HIMSELF SECURE."

STILL, HOWEVER, THOUGH EVERY THING HAD NOT BEEN ACCOMPLISHED BY HER
INGENIOUS DEVICE, SHE COULD NOT BUT FLATTER HERSELF THAT IT HAD BEEN
THE OCCASION OF MUCH PRESENT ENJOYMENT TO BOTH, AND MUST BE LEADING THEM
FORWARD TO THE GREAT EVENT.



CHAPTER XI


MR. ELTON MUST NOW BE LEFT TO HIMSELF. IT WAS NO LONGER IN EMMA'S POWER
TO SUPERINTEND HIS HAPPINESS OR QUICKEN HIS MEASURES. THE COMING OF HER
SISTER'S FAMILY WAS SO VERY NEAR AT HAND, THAT FIRST IN ANTICIPATION,
AND THEN IN REALITY, IT BECAME HENCEFORTH HER PRIME OBJECT OF INTEREST;
AND DURING THE TEN DAYS OF THEIR STAY AT HARTFIELD IT WAS NOT TO BE
EXPECTED--SHE DID NOT HERSELF EXPECT--THAT ANY THING BEYOND OCCASIONAL,
FORTUITOUS ASSISTANCE COULD BE AFFORDED BY HER TO THE LOVERS. THEY MIGHT
ADVANCE RAPIDLY IF THEY WOULD, HOWEVER; THEY MUST ADVANCE SOMEHOW OR
OTHER WHETHER THEY WOULD OR NO. SHE HARDLY WISHED TO HAVE MORE LEISURE
FOR THEM. THERE ARE PEOPLE, WHO THE MORE YOU DO FOR THEM, THE LESS THEY
WILL DO FOR THEMSELVES.

MR. AND MRS. JOHN KNIGHTLEY, FROM HAVING BEEN LONGER THAN USUAL ABSENT
FROM SURRY, WERE EXCITING OF COURSE RATHER MORE THAN THE USUAL INTEREST.
TILL THIS YEAR, EVERY LONG VACATION SINCE THEIR MARRIAGE HAD BEEN
DIVIDED BETWEEN HARTFIELD AND DONWELL ABBEY; BUT ALL THE HOLIDAYS OF
THIS AUTUMN HAD BEEN GIVEN TO SEA-BATHING FOR THE CHILDREN, AND IT WAS
THEREFORE MANY MONTHS SINCE THEY HAD BEEN SEEN IN A REGULAR WAY BY THEIR
SURRY CONNEXIONS, OR SEEN AT ALL BY MR. WOODHOUSE, WHO COULD NOT BE
INDUCED TO GET SO FAR AS LONDON, EVEN FOR POOR ISABELLA'S SAKE; AND
WHO CONSEQUENTLY WAS NOW MOST NERVOUSLY AND APPREHENSIVELY HAPPY IN
FORESTALLING THIS TOO SHORT VISIT.

HE THOUGHT MUCH OF THE EVILS OF THE JOURNEY FOR HER, AND NOT A LITTLE
OF THE FATIGUES OF HIS OWN HORSES AND COACHMAN WHO WERE TO BRING SOME
OF THE PARTY THE LAST HALF OF THE WAY; BUT HIS ALARMS WERE NEEDLESS;
THE SIXTEEN MILES BEING HAPPILY ACCOMPLISHED, AND MR. AND MRS. JOHN
KNIGHTLEY, THEIR FIVE CHILDREN, AND A COMPETENT NUMBER OF NURSERY-MAIDS,
ALL REACHING HARTFIELD IN SAFETY. THE BUSTLE AND JOY OF SUCH AN ARRIVAL,
THE MANY TO BE TALKED TO, WELCOMED, ENCOURAGED, AND VARIOUSLY DISPERSED
AND DISPOSED OF, PRODUCED A NOISE AND CONFUSION WHICH HIS NERVES COULD
NOT HAVE BORNE UNDER ANY OTHER CAUSE, NOR HAVE ENDURED MUCH LONGER EVEN
FOR THIS; BUT THE WAYS OF HARTFIELD AND THE FEELINGS OF HER FATHER
WERE SO RESPECTED BY MRS. JOHN KNIGHTLEY, THAT IN SPITE OF MATERNAL
SOLICITUDE FOR THE IMMEDIATE ENJOYMENT OF HER LITTLE ONES, AND FOR THEIR
HAVING INSTANTLY ALL THE LIBERTY AND ATTENDANCE, ALL THE EATING AND
DRINKING, AND SLEEPING AND PLAYING, WHICH THEY COULD POSSIBLY WISH FOR,
WITHOUT THE SMALLEST DELAY, THE CHILDREN WERE NEVER ALLOWED TO BE LONG
A DISTURBANCE TO HIM, EITHER IN THEMSELVES OR IN ANY RESTLESS ATTENDANCE
ON THEM.

MRS. JOHN KNIGHTLEY WAS A PRETTY, ELEGANT LITTLE WOMAN, OF GENTLE, QUIET
MANNERS, AND A DISPOSITION REMARKABLY AMIABLE AND AFFECTIONATE; WRAPT
UP IN HER FAMILY; A DEVOTED WIFE, A DOATING MOTHER, AND SO TENDERLY
ATTACHED TO HER FATHER AND SISTER THAT, BUT FOR THESE HIGHER TIES, A
WARMER LOVE MIGHT HAVE SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE. SHE COULD NEVER SEE A FAULT
IN ANY OF THEM. SHE WAS NOT A WOMAN OF STRONG UNDERSTANDING OR ANY
QUICKNESS; AND WITH THIS RESEMBLANCE OF HER FATHER, SHE INHERITED ALSO
MUCH OF HIS CONSTITUTION; WAS DELICATE IN HER OWN HEALTH, OVER-CAREFUL
OF THAT OF HER CHILDREN, HAD MANY FEARS AND MANY NERVES, AND WAS AS FOND
OF HER OWN MR. WINGFIELD IN TOWN AS HER FATHER COULD BE OF MR. PERRY.
THEY WERE ALIKE TOO, IN A GENERAL BENEVOLENCE OF TEMPER, AND A STRONG
HABIT OF REGARD FOR EVERY OLD ACQUAINTANCE.

MR. JOHN KNIGHTLEY WAS A TALL, GENTLEMAN-LIKE, AND VERY CLEVER MAN;
RISING IN HIS PROFESSION, DOMESTIC, AND RESPECTABLE IN HIS PRIVATE
CHARACTER; BUT WITH RESERVED MANNERS WHICH PREVENTED HIS BEING GENERALLY
PLEASING; AND CAPABLE OF BEING SOMETIMES OUT OF HUMOUR. HE WAS NOT AN
ILL-TEMPERED MAN, NOT SO OFTEN UNREASONABLY CROSS AS TO DESERVE SUCH A
REPROACH; BUT HIS TEMPER WAS NOT HIS GREAT PERFECTION; AND, INDEED, WITH
SUCH A WORSHIPPING WIFE, IT WAS HARDLY POSSIBLE THAT ANY NATURAL DEFECTS
IN IT SHOULD NOT BE INCREASED. THE EXTREME SWEETNESS OF HER TEMPER
MUST HURT HIS. HE HAD ALL THE CLEARNESS AND QUICKNESS OF MIND WHICH SHE
WANTED, AND HE COULD SOMETIMES ACT AN UNGRACIOUS, OR SAY A SEVERE THING.

HE WAS NOT A GREAT FAVOURITE WITH HIS FAIR SISTER-IN-LAW. NOTHING WRONG
IN HIM ESCAPED HER. SHE WAS QUICK IN FEELING THE LITTLE INJURIES TO
ISABELLA, WHICH ISABELLA NEVER FELT HERSELF. PERHAPS SHE MIGHT HAVE
PASSED OVER MORE HAD HIS MANNERS BEEN FLATTERING TO ISABELLA'S SISTER,
BUT THEY WERE ONLY THOSE OF A CALMLY KIND BROTHER AND FRIEND, WITHOUT
PRAISE AND WITHOUT BLINDNESS; BUT HARDLY ANY DEGREE OF PERSONAL
COMPLIMENT COULD HAVE MADE HER REGARDLESS OF THAT GREATEST FAULT OF
ALL IN HER EYES WHICH HE SOMETIMES FELL INTO, THE WANT OF RESPECTFUL
FORBEARANCE TOWARDS HER FATHER. THERE HE HAD NOT ALWAYS THE PATIENCE
THAT COULD HAVE BEEN WISHED. MR. WOODHOUSE'S PECULIARITIES AND
FIDGETINESS WERE SOMETIMES PROVOKING HIM TO A RATIONAL REMONSTRANCE OR
SHARP RETORT EQUALLY ILL-BESTOWED. IT DID NOT OFTEN HAPPEN; FOR MR. JOHN
KNIGHTLEY HAD REALLY A GREAT REGARD FOR HIS FATHER-IN-LAW, AND GENERALLY
A STRONG SENSE OF WHAT WAS DUE TO HIM; BUT IT WAS TOO OFTEN FOR EMMA'S
CHARITY, ESPECIALLY AS THERE WAS ALL THE PAIN OF APPREHENSION FREQUENTLY
TO BE ENDURED, THOUGH THE OFFENCE CAME NOT. THE BEGINNING, HOWEVER, OF
EVERY VISIT DISPLAYED NONE BUT THE PROPEREST FEELINGS, AND THIS BEING OF
NECESSITY SO SHORT MIGHT BE HOPED TO PASS AWAY IN UNSULLIED CORDIALITY.
THEY HAD NOT BEEN LONG SEATED AND COMPOSED WHEN MR. WOODHOUSE, WITH A
MELANCHOLY SHAKE OF THE HEAD AND A SIGH, CALLED HIS DAUGHTER'S ATTENTION
TO THE SAD CHANGE AT HARTFIELD SINCE SHE HAD BEEN THERE LAST.

"AH, MY DEAR," SAID HE, "POOR MISS TAYLOR--IT IS A GRIEVOUS BUSINESS."

"OH YES, SIR," CRIED SHE WITH READY SYMPATHY, "HOW YOU MUST MISS HER!
AND DEAR EMMA, TOO!--WHAT A DREADFUL LOSS TO YOU BOTH!--I HAVE BEEN SO
GRIEVED FOR YOU.--I COULD NOT IMAGINE HOW YOU COULD POSSIBLY DO WITHOUT
HER.--IT IS A SAD CHANGE INDEED.--BUT I HOPE SHE IS PRETTY WELL, SIR."

"PRETTY WELL, MY DEAR--I HOPE--PRETTY WELL.--I DO NOT KNOW BUT THAT THE
PLACE AGREES WITH HER TOLERABLY."

MR. JOHN KNIGHTLEY HERE ASKED EMMA QUIETLY WHETHER THERE WERE ANY DOUBTS
OF THE AIR OF RANDALLS.

"OH! NO--NONE IN THE LEAST. I NEVER SAW MRS. WESTON BETTER IN MY
LIFE--NEVER LOOKING SO WELL. PAPA IS ONLY SPEAKING HIS OWN REGRET."

"VERY MUCH TO THE HONOUR OF BOTH," WAS THE HANDSOME REPLY.

"AND DO YOU SEE HER, SIR, TOLERABLY OFTEN?" ASKED ISABELLA IN THE
PLAINTIVE TONE WHICH JUST SUITED HER FATHER.

MR. WOODHOUSE HESITATED.--"NOT NEAR SO OFTEN, MY DEAR, AS I COULD WISH."

"OH! PAPA, WE HAVE MISSED SEEING THEM BUT ONE ENTIRE DAY SINCE THEY
MARRIED. EITHER IN THE MORNING OR EVENING OF EVERY DAY, EXCEPTING ONE,
HAVE WE SEEN EITHER MR. WESTON OR MRS. WESTON, AND GENERALLY BOTH,
EITHER AT RANDALLS OR HERE--AND AS YOU MAY SUPPOSE, ISABELLA, MOST
FREQUENTLY HERE. THEY ARE VERY, VERY KIND IN THEIR VISITS. MR. WESTON
IS REALLY AS KIND AS HERSELF. PAPA, IF YOU SPEAK IN THAT MELANCHOLY WAY,
YOU WILL BE GIVING ISABELLA A FALSE IDEA OF US ALL. EVERY BODY MUST BE
AWARE THAT MISS TAYLOR MUST BE MISSED, BUT EVERY BODY OUGHT ALSO TO BE
ASSURED THAT MR. AND MRS. WESTON DO REALLY PREVENT OUR MISSING HER BY
ANY MEANS TO THE EXTENT WE OURSELVES ANTICIPATED--WHICH IS THE EXACT
TRUTH."

"JUST AS IT SHOULD BE," SAID MR. JOHN KNIGHTLEY, "AND JUST AS I HOPED
IT WAS FROM YOUR LETTERS. HER WISH OF SHEWING YOU ATTENTION COULD NOT BE
DOUBTED, AND HIS BEING A DISENGAGED AND SOCIAL MAN MAKES IT ALL EASY. I
HAVE BEEN ALWAYS TELLING YOU, MY LOVE, THAT I HAD NO IDEA OF THE CHANGE
BEING SO VERY MATERIAL TO HARTFIELD AS YOU APPREHENDED; AND NOW YOU HAVE
EMMA'S ACCOUNT, I HOPE YOU WILL BE SATISFIED."

"WHY, TO BE SURE," SAID MR. WOODHOUSE--"YES, CERTAINLY--I CANNOT
DENY THAT MRS. WESTON, POOR MRS. WESTON, DOES COME AND SEE US PRETTY
OFTEN--BUT THEN--SHE IS ALWAYS OBLIGED TO GO AWAY AGAIN."

"IT WOULD BE VERY HARD UPON MR. WESTON IF SHE DID NOT, PAPA.--YOU QUITE
FORGET POOR MR. WESTON."

"I THINK, INDEED," SAID JOHN KNIGHTLEY PLEASANTLY, "THAT MR. WESTON HAS
SOME LITTLE CLAIM. YOU AND I, EMMA, WILL VENTURE TO TAKE THE PART OF THE
POOR HUSBAND. I, BEING A HUSBAND, AND YOU NOT BEING A WIFE, THE CLAIMS
OF THE MAN MAY VERY LIKELY STRIKE US WITH EQUAL FORCE. AS FOR ISABELLA,
SHE HAS BEEN MARRIED LONG ENOUGH TO SEE THE CONVENIENCE OF PUTTING ALL
THE MR. WESTONS ASIDE AS MUCH AS SHE CAN."

"ME, MY LOVE," CRIED HIS WIFE, HEARING AND UNDERSTANDING ONLY IN PART.--
"ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT ME?--I AM SURE NOBODY OUGHT TO BE, OR CAN BE, A
GREATER ADVOCATE FOR MATRIMONY THAN I AM; AND IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR
THE MISERY OF HER LEAVING HARTFIELD, I SHOULD NEVER HAVE THOUGHT OF MISS
TAYLOR BUT AS THE MOST FORTUNATE WOMAN IN THE WORLD; AND AS TO SLIGHTING
MR. WESTON, THAT EXCELLENT MR. WESTON, I THINK THERE IS NOTHING HE DOES
NOT DESERVE. I BELIEVE HE IS ONE OF THE VERY BEST-TEMPERED MEN THAT EVER
EXISTED. EXCEPTING YOURSELF AND YOUR BROTHER, I DO NOT KNOW HIS EQUAL
FOR TEMPER. I SHALL NEVER FORGET HIS FLYING HENRY'S KITE FOR HIM THAT
VERY WINDY DAY LAST EASTER--AND EVER SINCE HIS PARTICULAR KINDNESS LAST
SEPTEMBER TWELVEMONTH IN WRITING THAT NOTE, AT TWELVE O'CLOCK AT NIGHT,
ON PURPOSE TO ASSURE ME THAT THERE WAS NO SCARLET FEVER AT COBHAM, I
HAVE BEEN CONVINCED THERE COULD NOT BE A MORE FEELING HEART NOR A BETTER
MAN IN EXISTENCE.--IF ANY BODY CAN DESERVE HIM, IT MUST BE MISS TAYLOR."

"WHERE IS THE YOUNG MAN?" SAID JOHN KNIGHTLEY. "HAS HE BEEN HERE ON THIS
OCCASION--OR HAS HE NOT?"

"HE HAS NOT BEEN HERE YET," REPLIED EMMA. "THERE WAS A STRONG
EXPECTATION OF HIS COMING SOON AFTER THE MARRIAGE, BUT IT ENDED IN
NOTHING; AND I HAVE NOT HEARD HIM MENTIONED LATELY."

"BUT YOU SHOULD TELL THEM OF THE LETTER, MY DEAR," SAID HER FATHER.
"HE WROTE A LETTER TO POOR MRS. WESTON, TO CONGRATULATE HER, AND A VERY
PROPER, HANDSOME LETTER IT WAS. SHE SHEWED IT TO ME. I THOUGHT IT VERY
WELL DONE OF HIM INDEED. WHETHER IT WAS HIS OWN IDEA YOU KNOW, ONE
CANNOT TELL. HE IS BUT YOUNG, AND HIS UNCLE, PERHAPS--"

"MY DEAR PAPA, HE IS THREE-AND-TWENTY. YOU FORGET HOW TIME PASSES."

"THREE-AND-TWENTY!--IS HE INDEED?--WELL, I COULD NOT HAVE THOUGHT
IT--AND HE WAS BUT TWO YEARS OLD WHEN HE LOST HIS POOR MOTHER! WELL,
TIME DOES FLY INDEED!--AND MY MEMORY IS VERY BAD. HOWEVER, IT WAS AN
EXCEEDING GOOD, PRETTY LETTER, AND GAVE MR. AND MRS. WESTON A GREAT DEAL
OF PLEASURE. I REMEMBER IT WAS WRITTEN FROM WEYMOUTH, AND DATED SEPT.
28TH--AND BEGAN, 'MY DEAR MADAM,' BUT I FORGET HOW IT WENT ON; AND IT
WAS SIGNED 'F. C. WESTON CHURCHILL.'--I REMEMBER THAT PERFECTLY."

"HOW VERY PLEASING AND PROPER OF HIM!" CRIED THE GOOD-HEARTED MRS. JOHN
KNIGHTLEY. "I HAVE NO DOUBT OF HIS BEING A MOST AMIABLE YOUNG MAN. BUT
HOW SAD IT IS THAT HE SHOULD NOT LIVE AT HOME WITH HIS FATHER! THERE IS
SOMETHING SO SHOCKING IN A CHILD'S BEING TAKEN AWAY FROM HIS PARENTS AND
NATURAL HOME! I NEVER COULD COMPREHEND HOW MR. WESTON COULD PART WITH
HIM. TO GIVE UP ONE'S CHILD! I REALLY NEVER COULD THINK WELL OF ANY BODY
WHO PROPOSED SUCH A THING TO ANY BODY ELSE."

"NOBODY EVER DID THINK WELL OF THE CHURCHILLS, I FANCY," OBSERVED MR.
JOHN KNIGHTLEY COOLLY. "BUT YOU NEED NOT IMAGINE MR. WESTON TO HAVE FELT
WHAT YOU WOULD FEEL IN GIVING UP HENRY OR JOHN. MR. WESTON IS RATHER
AN EASY, CHEERFUL-TEMPERED MAN, THAN A MAN OF STRONG FEELINGS; HE TAKES
THINGS AS HE FINDS THEM, AND MAKES ENJOYMENT OF THEM SOMEHOW OR OTHER,
DEPENDING, I SUSPECT, MUCH MORE UPON WHAT IS CALLED SOCIETY FOR HIS
COMFORTS, THAT IS, UPON THE POWER OF EATING AND DRINKING, AND PLAYING
WHIST WITH HIS NEIGHBOURS FIVE TIMES A WEEK, THAN UPON FAMILY AFFECTION,
OR ANY THING THAT HOME AFFORDS."

EMMA COULD NOT LIKE WHAT BORDERED ON A REFLECTION ON MR. WESTON, AND HAD
HALF A MIND TO TAKE IT UP; BUT SHE STRUGGLED, AND LET IT PASS. SHE
WOULD KEEP THE PEACE IF POSSIBLE; AND THERE WAS SOMETHING HONOURABLE AND
VALUABLE IN THE STRONG DOMESTIC HABITS, THE ALL-SUFFICIENCY OF HOME TO
HIMSELF, WHENCE RESULTED HER BROTHER'S DISPOSITION TO LOOK DOWN ON
THE COMMON RATE OF SOCIAL INTERCOURSE, AND THOSE TO WHOM IT WAS
IMPORTANT.--IT HAD A HIGH CLAIM TO FORBEARANCE.



CHAPTER XII


MR. KNIGHTLEY WAS TO DINE WITH THEM--RATHER AGAINST THE INCLINATION OF
MR. WOODHOUSE, WHO DID NOT LIKE THAT ANY ONE SHOULD SHARE WITH HIM IN
ISABELLA'S FIRST DAY. EMMA'S SENSE OF RIGHT HOWEVER HAD DECIDED IT;
AND BESIDES THE CONSIDERATION OF WHAT WAS DUE TO EACH BROTHER, SHE HAD
PARTICULAR PLEASURE, FROM THE CIRCUMSTANCE OF THE LATE DISAGREEMENT
BETWEEN MR. KNIGHTLEY AND HERSELF, IN PROCURING HIM THE PROPER
INVITATION.

SHE HOPED THEY MIGHT NOW BECOME FRIENDS AGAIN. SHE THOUGHT IT WAS TIME
TO MAKE UP. MAKING-UP INDEED WOULD NOT DO. SHE CERTAINLY HAD NOT BEEN
IN THE WRONG, AND HE WOULD NEVER OWN THAT HE HAD. CONCESSION MUST BE
OUT OF THE QUESTION; BUT IT WAS TIME TO APPEAR TO FORGET THAT THEY HAD
EVER QUARRELLED; AND SHE HOPED IT MIGHT RATHER ASSIST THE RESTORATION OF
FRIENDSHIP, THAT WHEN HE CAME INTO THE ROOM SHE HAD ONE OF THE CHILDREN
WITH HER--THE YOUNGEST, A NICE LITTLE GIRL ABOUT EIGHT MONTHS OLD, WHO
WAS NOW MAKING HER FIRST VISIT TO HARTFIELD, AND VERY HAPPY TO BE DANCED
ABOUT IN HER AUNT'S ARMS. IT DID ASSIST; FOR THOUGH HE BEGAN WITH GRAVE
LOOKS AND SHORT QUESTIONS, HE WAS SOON LED ON TO TALK OF THEM ALL IN
THE USUAL WAY, AND TO TAKE THE CHILD OUT OF HER ARMS WITH ALL THE
UNCEREMONIOUSNESS OF PERFECT AMITY. EMMA FELT THEY WERE FRIENDS AGAIN;
AND THE CONVICTION GIVING HER AT FIRST GREAT SATISFACTION, AND THEN
A LITTLE SAUCINESS, SHE COULD NOT HELP SAYING, AS HE WAS ADMIRING THE
BABY,

"WHAT A COMFORT IT IS, THAT WE THINK ALIKE ABOUT OUR NEPHEWS AND NIECES.
AS TO MEN AND WOMEN, OUR OPINIONS ARE SOMETIMES VERY DIFFERENT; BUT WITH
REGARD TO THESE CHILDREN, I OBSERVE WE NEVER DISAGREE."

"IF YOU WERE AS MUCH GUIDED BY NATURE IN YOUR ESTIMATE OF MEN AND WOMEN,
AND AS LITTLE UNDER THE POWER OF FANCY AND WHIM IN YOUR DEALINGS WITH
THEM, AS YOU ARE WHERE THESE CHILDREN ARE CONCERNED, WE MIGHT ALWAYS
THINK ALIKE."

"TO BE SURE--OUR DISCORDANCIES MUST ALWAYS ARISE FROM MY BEING IN THE
WRONG."

"YES," SAID HE, SMILING--"AND REASON GOOD. I WAS SIXTEEN YEARS OLD WHEN
YOU WERE BORN."

"A MATERIAL DIFFERENCE THEN," SHE REPLIED--"AND NO DOUBT YOU WERE MUCH
MY SUPERIOR IN JUDGMENT AT THAT PERIOD OF OUR LIVES; BUT DOES NOT THE
LAPSE OF ONE-AND-TWENTY YEARS BRING OUR UNDERSTANDINGS A GOOD DEAL
NEARER?"

"YES--A GOOD DEAL NEARER."

"BUT STILL, NOT NEAR ENOUGH TO GIVE ME A CHANCE OF BEING RIGHT, IF WE
THINK DIFFERENTLY."

"I HAVE STILL THE ADVANTAGE OF YOU BY SIXTEEN YEARS' EXPERIENCE, AND BY
NOT BEING A PRETTY YOUNG WOMAN AND A SPOILED CHILD. COME, MY DEAR EMMA,
LET US BE FRIENDS, AND SAY NO MORE ABOUT IT. TELL YOUR AUNT, LITTLE
EMMA, THAT SHE OUGHT TO SET YOU A BETTER EXAMPLE THAN TO BE RENEWING OLD
GRIEVANCES, AND THAT IF SHE WERE NOT WRONG BEFORE, SHE IS NOW."

"THAT'S TRUE," SHE CRIED--"VERY TRUE. LITTLE EMMA, GROW UP A BETTER
WOMAN THAN YOUR AUNT. BE INFINITELY CLEVERER AND NOT HALF SO CONCEITED.
NOW, MR. KNIGHTLEY, A WORD OR TWO MORE, AND I HAVE DONE. AS FAR AS GOOD
INTENTIONS WENT, WE WERE BOTH RIGHT, AND I MUST SAY THAT NO EFFECTS ON
MY SIDE OF THE ARGUMENT HAVE YET PROVED WRONG. I ONLY WANT TO KNOW THAT
MR. MARTIN IS NOT VERY, VERY BITTERLY DISAPPOINTED."

"A MAN CANNOT BE MORE SO," WAS HIS SHORT, FULL ANSWER.

"AH!--INDEED I AM VERY SORRY.--COME, SHAKE HANDS WITH ME."

THIS HAD JUST TAKEN PLACE AND WITH GREAT CORDIALITY, WHEN JOHN KNIGHTLEY
MADE HIS APPEARANCE, AND "HOW D'YE DO, GEORGE?" AND "JOHN, HOW ARE
YOU?" SUCCEEDED IN THE TRUE ENGLISH STYLE, BURYING UNDER A CALMNESS THAT
SEEMED ALL BUT INDIFFERENCE, THE REAL ATTACHMENT WHICH WOULD HAVE LED
EITHER OF THEM, IF REQUISITE, TO DO EVERY THING FOR THE GOOD OF THE
OTHER.

THE EVENING WAS QUIET AND CONVERSABLE, AS MR. WOODHOUSE DECLINED CARDS
ENTIRELY FOR THE SAKE OF COMFORTABLE TALK WITH HIS DEAR ISABELLA, AND
THE LITTLE PARTY MADE TWO NATURAL DIVISIONS; ON ONE SIDE HE AND HIS
DAUGHTER; ON THE OTHER THE TWO MR. KNIGHTLEYS; THEIR SUBJECTS TOTALLY
DISTINCT, OR VERY RARELY MIXING--AND EMMA ONLY OCCASIONALLY JOINING IN
ONE OR THE OTHER.

THE BROTHERS TALKED OF THEIR OWN CONCERNS AND PURSUITS, BUT PRINCIPALLY
OF THOSE OF THE ELDER, WHOSE TEMPER WAS BY MUCH THE MOST COMMUNICATIVE,
AND WHO WAS ALWAYS THE GREATER TALKER. AS A MAGISTRATE, HE HAD GENERALLY
SOME POINT OF LAW TO CONSULT JOHN ABOUT, OR, AT LEAST, SOME CURIOUS
ANECDOTE TO GIVE; AND AS A FARMER, AS KEEPING IN HAND THE HOME-FARM AT
DONWELL, HE HAD TO TELL WHAT EVERY FIELD WAS TO BEAR NEXT YEAR, AND TO
GIVE ALL SUCH LOCAL INFORMATION AS COULD NOT FAIL OF BEING INTERESTING
TO A BROTHER WHOSE HOME IT HAD EQUALLY BEEN THE LONGEST PART OF HIS
LIFE, AND WHOSE ATTACHMENTS WERE STRONG. THE PLAN OF A DRAIN, THE CHANGE
OF A FENCE, THE FELLING OF A TREE, AND THE DESTINATION OF EVERY ACRE FOR
WHEAT, TURNIPS, OR SPRING CORN, WAS ENTERED INTO WITH AS MUCH EQUALITY
OF INTEREST BY JOHN, AS HIS COOLER MANNERS RENDERED POSSIBLE; AND IF HIS
WILLING BROTHER EVER LEFT HIM ANY THING TO INQUIRE ABOUT, HIS INQUIRIES
EVEN APPROACHED A TONE OF EAGERNESS.

WHILE THEY WERE THUS COMFORTABLY OCCUPIED, MR. WOODHOUSE WAS ENJOYING A
FULL FLOW OF HAPPY REGRETS AND FEARFUL AFFECTION WITH HIS DAUGHTER.

"MY POOR DEAR ISABELLA," SAID HE, FONDLY TAKING HER HAND, AND
INTERRUPTING, FOR A FEW MOMENTS, HER BUSY LABOURS FOR SOME ONE OF HER
FIVE CHILDREN--"HOW LONG IT IS, HOW TERRIBLY LONG SINCE YOU WERE HERE!
AND HOW TIRED YOU MUST BE AFTER YOUR JOURNEY! YOU MUST GO TO BED EARLY,
MY DEAR--AND I RECOMMEND A LITTLE GRUEL TO YOU BEFORE YOU GO.--YOU AND
I WILL HAVE A NICE BASIN OF GRUEL TOGETHER. MY DEAR EMMA, SUPPOSE WE ALL
HAVE A LITTLE GRUEL."

EMMA COULD NOT SUPPOSE ANY SUCH THING, KNOWING AS SHE DID, THAT BOTH THE
MR. KNIGHTLEYS WERE AS UNPERSUADABLE ON THAT ARTICLE AS HERSELF;--AND
TWO BASINS ONLY WERE ORDERED. AFTER A LITTLE MORE DISCOURSE IN PRAISE OF
GRUEL, WITH SOME WONDERING AT ITS NOT BEING TAKEN EVERY EVENING BY EVERY
BODY, HE PROCEEDED TO SAY, WITH AN AIR OF GRAVE REFLECTION,

"IT WAS AN AWKWARD BUSINESS, MY DEAR, YOUR SPENDING THE AUTUMN AT SOUTH
END INSTEAD OF COMING HERE. I NEVER HAD MUCH OPINION OF THE SEA AIR."

"MR. WINGFIELD MOST STRENUOUSLY RECOMMENDED IT, SIR--OR WE SHOULD NOT
HAVE GONE. HE RECOMMENDED IT FOR ALL THE CHILDREN, BUT PARTICULARLY FOR
THE WEAKNESS IN LITTLE BELLA'S THROAT,--BOTH SEA AIR AND BATHING."

"AH! MY DEAR, BUT PERRY HAD MANY DOUBTS ABOUT THE SEA DOING HER ANY
GOOD; AND AS TO MYSELF, I HAVE BEEN LONG PERFECTLY CONVINCED, THOUGH
PERHAPS I NEVER TOLD YOU SO BEFORE, THAT THE SEA IS VERY RARELY OF USE
TO ANY BODY. I AM SURE IT ALMOST KILLED ME ONCE."

"COME, COME," CRIED EMMA, FEELING THIS TO BE AN UNSAFE SUBJECT, "I MUST
BEG YOU NOT TO TALK OF THE SEA. IT MAKES ME ENVIOUS AND MISERABLE;--I
WHO HAVE NEVER SEEN IT! SOUTH END IS PROHIBITED, IF YOU PLEASE. MY DEAR
ISABELLA, I HAVE NOT HEARD YOU MAKE ONE INQUIRY ABOUT MR. PERRY YET; AND
HE NEVER FORGETS YOU."

"OH! GOOD MR. PERRY--HOW IS HE, SIR?"

"WHY, PRETTY WELL; BUT NOT QUITE WELL. POOR PERRY IS BILIOUS, AND HE HAS
NOT TIME TO TAKE CARE OF HIMSELF--HE TELLS ME HE HAS NOT TIME TO TAKE
CARE OF HIMSELF--WHICH IS VERY SAD--BUT HE IS ALWAYS WANTED ALL ROUND
THE COUNTRY. I SUPPOSE THERE IS NOT A MAN IN SUCH PRACTICE ANYWHERE. BUT
THEN THERE IS NOT SO CLEVER A MAN ANY WHERE."

"AND MRS. PERRY AND THE CHILDREN, HOW ARE THEY? DO THE CHILDREN GROW?
I HAVE A GREAT REGARD FOR MR. PERRY. I HOPE HE WILL BE CALLING SOON. HE
WILL BE SO PLEASED TO SEE MY LITTLE ONES."

"I HOPE HE WILL BE HERE TO-MORROW, FOR I HAVE A QUESTION OR TWO TO ASK
HIM ABOUT MYSELF OF SOME CONSEQUENCE. AND, MY DEAR, WHENEVER HE COMES,
YOU HAD BETTER LET HIM LOOK AT LITTLE BELLA'S THROAT."

"OH! MY DEAR SIR, HER THROAT IS SO MUCH BETTER THAT I HAVE HARDLY ANY
UNEASINESS ABOUT IT. EITHER BATHING HAS BEEN OF THE GREATEST SERVICE TO
HER, OR ELSE IT IS TO BE ATTRIBUTED TO AN EXCELLENT EMBROCATION OF MR.
WINGFIELD'S, WHICH WE HAVE BEEN APPLYING AT TIMES EVER SINCE AUGUST."

"IT IS NOT VERY LIKELY, MY DEAR, THAT BATHING SHOULD HAVE BEEN OF USE
TO HER--AND IF I HAD KNOWN YOU WERE WANTING AN EMBROCATION, I WOULD HAVE
SPOKEN TO--

"YOU SEEM TO ME TO HAVE FORGOTTEN MRS. AND MISS BATES," SAID EMMA, "I
HAVE NOT HEARD ONE INQUIRY AFTER THEM."

"OH! THE GOOD BATESES--I AM QUITE ASHAMED OF MYSELF--BUT YOU MENTION
THEM IN MOST OF YOUR LETTERS. I HOPE THEY ARE QUITE WELL. GOOD OLD MRS.
BATES--I WILL CALL UPON HER TO-MORROW, AND TAKE MY CHILDREN.--THEY
ARE ALWAYS SO PLEASED TO SEE MY CHILDREN.--AND THAT EXCELLENT MISS
BATES!--SUCH THOROUGH WORTHY PEOPLE!--HOW ARE THEY, SIR?"

"WHY, PRETTY WELL, MY DEAR, UPON THE WHOLE. BUT POOR MRS. BATES HAD A
BAD COLD ABOUT A MONTH AGO."

"HOW SORRY I AM! BUT COLDS WERE NEVER SO PREVALENT AS THEY HAVE BEEN
THIS AUTUMN. MR. WINGFIELD TOLD ME THAT HE HAS NEVER KNOWN THEM MORE
GENERAL OR HEAVY--EXCEPT WHEN IT HAS BEEN QUITE AN INFLUENZA."

"THAT HAS BEEN A GOOD DEAL THE CASE, MY DEAR; BUT NOT TO THE DEGREE YOU
MENTION. PERRY SAYS THAT COLDS HAVE BEEN VERY GENERAL, BUT NOT SO HEAVY
AS HE HAS VERY OFTEN KNOWN THEM IN NOVEMBER. PERRY DOES NOT CALL IT
ALTOGETHER A SICKLY SEASON."

"NO, I DO NOT KNOW THAT MR. WINGFIELD CONSIDERS IT VERY SICKLY
EXCEPT--

"AH! MY POOR DEAR CHILD, THE TRUTH IS, THAT IN LONDON IT IS ALWAYS
A SICKLY SEASON. NOBODY IS HEALTHY IN LONDON, NOBODY CAN BE. IT IS A
DREADFUL THING TO HAVE YOU FORCED TO LIVE THERE! SO FAR OFF!--AND THE
AIR SO BAD!"

"NO, INDEED--WE ARE NOT AT ALL IN A BAD AIR. OUR PART OF LONDON IS
VERY SUPERIOR TO MOST OTHERS!--YOU MUST NOT CONFOUND US WITH LONDON
IN GENERAL, MY DEAR SIR. THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF BRUNSWICK SQUARE IS VERY
DIFFERENT FROM ALMOST ALL THE REST. WE ARE SO VERY AIRY! I SHOULD BE
UNWILLING, I OWN, TO LIVE IN ANY OTHER PART OF THE TOWN;--THERE IS
HARDLY ANY OTHER THAT I COULD BE SATISFIED TO HAVE MY CHILDREN IN:
BUT WE ARE SO REMARKABLY AIRY!--MR. WINGFIELD THINKS THE VICINITY OF
BRUNSWICK SQUARE DECIDEDLY THE MOST FAVOURABLE AS TO AIR."

"AH! MY DEAR, IT IS NOT LIKE HARTFIELD. YOU MAKE THE BEST OF IT--BUT
AFTER YOU HAVE BEEN A WEEK AT HARTFIELD, YOU ARE ALL OF YOU DIFFERENT
CREATURES; YOU DO NOT LOOK LIKE THE SAME. NOW I CANNOT SAY, THAT I THINK
YOU ARE ANY OF YOU LOOKING WELL AT PRESENT."

"I AM SORRY TO HEAR YOU SAY SO, SIR; BUT I ASSURE YOU, EXCEPTING THOSE
LITTLE NERVOUS HEAD-ACHES AND PALPITATIONS WHICH I AM NEVER ENTIRELY
FREE FROM ANYWHERE, I AM QUITE WELL MYSELF; AND IF THE CHILDREN WERE
RATHER PALE BEFORE THEY WENT TO BED, IT WAS ONLY BECAUSE THEY WERE A
LITTLE MORE TIRED THAN USUAL, FROM THEIR JOURNEY AND THE HAPPINESS OF
COMING. I HOPE YOU WILL THINK BETTER OF THEIR LOOKS TO-MORROW; FOR I
ASSURE YOU MR. WINGFIELD TOLD ME, THAT HE DID NOT BELIEVE HE HAD EVER
SENT US OFF ALTOGETHER, IN SUCH GOOD CASE. I TRUST, AT LEAST, THAT
YOU DO NOT THINK MR. KNIGHTLEY LOOKING ILL," TURNING HER EYES WITH
AFFECTIONATE ANXIETY TOWARDS HER HUSBAND.

"MIDDLING, MY DEAR; I CANNOT COMPLIMENT YOU. I THINK MR. JOHN KNIGHTLEY
VERY FAR FROM LOOKING WELL."

"WHAT IS THE MATTER, SIR?--DID YOU SPEAK TO ME?" CRIED MR. JOHN
KNIGHTLEY, HEARING HIS OWN NAME.

"I AM SORRY TO FIND, MY LOVE, THAT MY FATHER DOES NOT THINK YOU LOOKING
WELL--BUT I HOPE IT IS ONLY FROM BEING A LITTLE FATIGUED. I COULD HAVE
WISHED, HOWEVER, AS YOU KNOW, THAT YOU HAD SEEN MR. WINGFIELD BEFORE YOU
LEFT HOME."

"MY DEAR ISABELLA,"--EXCLAIMED HE HASTILY--"PRAY DO NOT CONCERN YOURSELF
ABOUT MY LOOKS. BE SATISFIED WITH DOCTORING AND CODDLING YOURSELF AND
THE CHILDREN, AND LET ME LOOK AS I CHUSE."

"I DID NOT THOROUGHLY UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU WERE TELLING YOUR BROTHER,"
CRIED EMMA, "ABOUT YOUR FRIEND MR. GRAHAM'S INTENDING TO HAVE A BAILIFF
FROM SCOTLAND, TO LOOK AFTER HIS NEW ESTATE. WHAT WILL IT ANSWER? WILL
NOT THE OLD PREJUDICE BE TOO STRONG?"

AND SHE TALKED IN THIS WAY SO LONG AND SUCCESSFULLY THAT, WHEN FORCED TO
GIVE HER ATTENTION AGAIN TO HER FATHER AND SISTER, SHE HAD NOTHING
WORSE TO HEAR THAN ISABELLA'S KIND INQUIRY AFTER JANE FAIRFAX; AND JANE
FAIRFAX, THOUGH NO GREAT FAVOURITE WITH HER IN GENERAL, SHE WAS AT THAT
MOMENT VERY HAPPY TO ASSIST IN PRAISING.

"THAT SWEET, AMIABLE JANE FAIRFAX!" SAID MRS. JOHN KNIGHTLEY.--"IT
IS SO LONG SINCE I HAVE SEEN HER, EXCEPT NOW AND THEN FOR A MOMENT
ACCIDENTALLY IN TOWN! WHAT HAPPINESS IT MUST BE TO HER GOOD OLD
GRANDMOTHER AND EXCELLENT AUNT, WHEN SHE COMES TO VISIT THEM! I ALWAYS
REGRET EXCESSIVELY ON DEAR EMMA'S ACCOUNT THAT SHE CANNOT BE MORE AT
HIGHBURY; BUT NOW THEIR DAUGHTER IS MARRIED, I SUPPOSE COLONEL AND MRS.
CAMPBELL WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PART WITH HER AT ALL. SHE WOULD BE SUCH A
DELIGHTFUL COMPANION FOR EMMA."

MR. WOODHOUSE AGREED TO IT ALL, BUT ADDED,

"OUR LITTLE FRIEND HARRIET SMITH, HOWEVER, IS JUST SUCH ANOTHER PRETTY
KIND OF YOUNG PERSON. YOU WILL LIKE HARRIET. EMMA COULD NOT HAVE A
BETTER COMPANION THAN HARRIET."

"I AM MOST HAPPY TO HEAR IT--BUT ONLY JANE FAIRFAX ONE KNOWS TO BE SO
VERY ACCOMPLISHED AND SUPERIOR!--AND EXACTLY EMMA'S AGE."

THIS TOPIC WAS DISCUSSED VERY HAPPILY, AND OTHERS SUCCEEDED OF SIMILAR
MOMENT, AND PASSED AWAY WITH SIMILAR HARMONY; BUT THE EVENING DID NOT
CLOSE WITHOUT A LITTLE RETURN OF AGITATION. THE GRUEL CAME AND SUPPLIED
A GREAT DEAL TO BE SAID--MUCH PRAISE AND MANY COMMENTS--UNDOUBTING
DECISION OF ITS WHOLESOMENESS FOR EVERY CONSTITUTION, AND PRETTY
SEVERE PHILIPPICS UPON THE MANY HOUSES WHERE IT WAS NEVER MET WITH
TOLERABLE;--BUT, UNFORTUNATELY, AMONG THE FAILURES WHICH THE DAUGHTER
HAD TO INSTANCE, THE MOST RECENT, AND THEREFORE MOST PROMINENT, WAS IN
HER OWN COOK AT SOUTH END, A YOUNG WOMAN HIRED FOR THE TIME, WHO NEVER
HAD BEEN ABLE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT SHE MEANT BY A BASIN OF NICE SMOOTH
GRUEL, THIN, BUT NOT TOO THIN. OFTEN AS SHE HAD WISHED FOR AND ORDERED
IT, SHE HAD NEVER BEEN ABLE TO GET ANY THING TOLERABLE. HERE WAS A
DANGEROUS OPENING.

"AH!" SAID MR. WOODHOUSE, SHAKING HIS HEAD AND FIXING HIS EYES ON HER
WITH TENDER CONCERN.--THE EJACULATION IN EMMA'S EAR EXPRESSED, "AH!
THERE IS NO END OF THE SAD CONSEQUENCES OF YOUR GOING TO SOUTH END. IT
DOES NOT BEAR TALKING OF." AND FOR A LITTLE WHILE SHE HOPED HE WOULD NOT
TALK OF IT, AND THAT A SILENT RUMINATION MIGHT SUFFICE TO RESTORE HIM TO
THE RELISH OF HIS OWN SMOOTH GRUEL. AFTER AN INTERVAL OF SOME MINUTES,
HOWEVER, HE BEGAN WITH,

"I SHALL ALWAYS BE VERY SORRY THAT YOU WENT TO THE SEA THIS AUTUMN,
INSTEAD OF COMING HERE."

"BUT WHY SHOULD YOU BE SORRY, SIR?--I ASSURE YOU, IT DID THE CHILDREN A
GREAT DEAL OF GOOD."

"AND, MOREOVER, IF YOU MUST GO TO THE SEA, IT HAD BETTER NOT HAVE BEEN
TO SOUTH END. SOUTH END IS AN UNHEALTHY PLACE. PERRY WAS SURPRIZED TO
HEAR YOU HAD FIXED UPON SOUTH END."

"I KNOW THERE IS SUCH AN IDEA WITH MANY PEOPLE, BUT INDEED IT IS QUITE
A MISTAKE, SIR.--WE ALL HAD OUR HEALTH PERFECTLY WELL THERE, NEVER
FOUND THE LEAST INCONVENIENCE FROM THE MUD; AND MR. WINGFIELD SAYS IT IS
ENTIRELY A MISTAKE TO SUPPOSE THE PLACE UNHEALTHY; AND I AM SURE HE MAY
BE DEPENDED ON, FOR HE THOROUGHLY UNDERSTANDS THE NATURE OF THE AIR, AND
HIS OWN BROTHER AND FAMILY HAVE BEEN THERE REPEATEDLY."

"YOU SHOULD HAVE GONE TO CROMER, MY DEAR, IF YOU WENT ANYWHERE.--PERRY
WAS A WEEK AT CROMER ONCE, AND HE HOLDS IT TO BE THE BEST OF ALL THE
SEA-BATHING PLACES. A FINE OPEN SEA, HE SAYS, AND VERY PURE AIR. AND, BY
WHAT I UNDERSTAND, YOU MIGHT HAVE HAD LODGINGS THERE QUITE AWAY FROM
THE SEA--A QUARTER OF A MILE OFF--VERY COMFORTABLE. YOU SHOULD HAVE
CONSULTED PERRY."

"BUT, MY DEAR SIR, THE DIFFERENCE OF THE JOURNEY;--ONLY CONSIDER HOW
GREAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN.--AN HUNDRED MILES, PERHAPS, INSTEAD OF FORTY."

"AH! MY DEAR, AS PERRY SAYS, WHERE HEALTH IS AT STAKE, NOTHING ELSE
SHOULD BE CONSIDERED; AND IF ONE IS TO TRAVEL, THERE IS NOT MUCH TO
CHUSE BETWEEN FORTY MILES AND AN HUNDRED.--BETTER NOT MOVE AT ALL,
BETTER STAY IN LONDON ALTOGETHER THAN TRAVEL FORTY MILES TO GET INTO
A WORSE AIR. THIS IS JUST WHAT PERRY SAID. IT SEEMED TO HIM A VERY
ILL-JUDGED MEASURE."

EMMA'S ATTEMPTS TO STOP HER FATHER HAD BEEN VAIN; AND WHEN HE
HAD REACHED SUCH A POINT AS THIS, SHE COULD NOT WONDER AT HER
BROTHER-IN-LAW'S BREAKING OUT.

"MR. PERRY," SAID HE, IN A VOICE OF VERY STRONG DISPLEASURE, "WOULD DO
AS WELL TO KEEP HIS OPINION TILL IT IS ASKED FOR. WHY DOES HE MAKE IT
ANY BUSINESS OF HIS, TO WONDER AT WHAT I DO?--AT MY TAKING MY FAMILY TO
ONE PART OF THE COAST OR ANOTHER?--I MAY BE ALLOWED, I HOPE, THE USE OF
MY JUDGMENT AS WELL AS MR. PERRY.--I WANT HIS DIRECTIONS NO MORE THAN
HIS DRUGS." HE PAUSED--AND GROWING COOLER IN A MOMENT, ADDED, WITH ONLY
SARCASTIC DRYNESS, "IF MR. PERRY CAN TELL ME HOW TO CONVEY A WIFE AND
FIVE CHILDREN A DISTANCE OF AN HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILES WITH NO GREATER
EXPENSE OR INCONVENIENCE THAN A DISTANCE OF FORTY, I SHOULD BE AS
WILLING TO PREFER CROMER TO SOUTH END AS HE COULD HIMSELF."

"TRUE, TRUE," CRIED MR. KNIGHTLEY, WITH MOST READY INTERPOSITION--"VERY
TRUE. THAT'S A CONSIDERATION INDEED.--BUT JOHN, AS TO WHAT I WAS TELLING
YOU OF MY IDEA OF MOVING THE PATH TO LANGHAM, OF TURNING IT MORE TO THE
RIGHT THAT IT MAY NOT CUT THROUGH THE HOME MEADOWS, I CANNOT CONCEIVE
ANY DIFFICULTY. I SHOULD NOT ATTEMPT IT, IF IT WERE TO BE THE MEANS OF
INCONVENIENCE TO THE HIGHBURY PEOPLE, BUT IF YOU CALL TO MIND EXACTLY
THE PRESENT LINE OF THE PATH.... THE ONLY WAY OF PROVING IT, HOWEVER,
WILL BE TO TURN TO OUR MAPS. I SHALL SEE YOU AT THE ABBEY TO-MORROW
MORNING I HOPE, AND THEN WE WILL LOOK THEM OVER, AND YOU SHALL GIVE ME
YOUR OPINION."

MR. WOODHOUSE WAS RATHER AGITATED BY SUCH HARSH REFLECTIONS ON HIS
FRIEND PERRY, TO WHOM HE HAD, IN FACT, THOUGH UNCONSCIOUSLY, BEEN
ATTRIBUTING MANY OF HIS OWN FEELINGS AND EXPRESSIONS;--BUT THE SOOTHING
ATTENTIONS OF HIS DAUGHTERS GRADUALLY REMOVED THE PRESENT EVIL, AND
THE IMMEDIATE ALERTNESS OF ONE BROTHER, AND BETTER RECOLLECTIONS OF THE
OTHER, PREVENTED ANY RENEWAL OF IT.



CHAPTER XIII


THERE COULD HARDLY BE A HAPPIER CREATURE IN THE WORLD THAN MRS. JOHN
KNIGHTLEY, IN THIS SHORT VISIT TO HARTFIELD, GOING ABOUT EVERY MORNING
AMONG HER OLD ACQUAINTANCE WITH HER FIVE CHILDREN, AND TALKING OVER WHAT
SHE HAD DONE EVERY EVENING WITH HER FATHER AND SISTER. SHE HAD NOTHING
TO WISH OTHERWISE, BUT THAT THE DAYS DID NOT PASS SO SWIFTLY. IT WAS A
DELIGHTFUL VISIT;--PERFECT, IN BEING MUCH TOO SHORT.

IN GENERAL THEIR EVENINGS WERE LESS ENGAGED WITH FRIENDS THAN THEIR
MORNINGS; BUT ONE COMPLETE DINNER ENGAGEMENT, AND OUT OF THE HOUSE TOO,
THERE WAS NO AVOIDING, THOUGH AT CHRISTMAS. MR. WESTON WOULD TAKE NO
DENIAL; THEY MUST ALL DINE AT RANDALLS ONE DAY;--EVEN MR. WOODHOUSE WAS
PERSUADED TO THINK IT A POSSIBLE THING IN PREFERENCE TO A DIVISION OF
THE PARTY.

HOW THEY WERE ALL TO BE CONVEYED, HE WOULD HAVE MADE A DIFFICULTY IF HE
COULD, BUT AS HIS SON AND DAUGHTER'S CARRIAGE AND HORSES WERE ACTUALLY
AT HARTFIELD, HE WAS NOT ABLE TO MAKE MORE THAN A SIMPLE QUESTION ON
THAT HEAD; IT HARDLY AMOUNTED TO A DOUBT; NOR DID IT OCCUPY EMMA LONG
TO CONVINCE HIM THAT THEY MIGHT IN ONE OF THE CARRIAGES FIND ROOM FOR
HARRIET ALSO.

HARRIET, MR. ELTON, AND MR. KNIGHTLEY, THEIR OWN ESPECIAL SET, WERE THE
ONLY PERSONS INVITED TO MEET THEM;--THE HOURS WERE TO BE EARLY, AS
WELL AS THE NUMBERS FEW; MR. WOODHOUSE'S HABITS AND INCLINATION BEING
CONSULTED IN EVERY THING.

THE EVENING BEFORE THIS GREAT EVENT (FOR IT WAS A VERY GREAT EVENT THAT
MR. WOODHOUSE SHOULD DINE OUT, ON THE 24TH OF DECEMBER) HAD BEEN SPENT
BY HARRIET AT HARTFIELD, AND SHE HAD GONE HOME SO MUCH INDISPOSED WITH
A COLD, THAT, BUT FOR HER OWN EARNEST WISH OF BEING NURSED BY MRS.
GODDARD, EMMA COULD NOT HAVE ALLOWED HER TO LEAVE THE HOUSE. EMMA CALLED
ON HER THE NEXT DAY, AND FOUND HER DOOM ALREADY SIGNED WITH REGARD TO
RANDALLS. SHE WAS VERY FEVERISH AND HAD A BAD SORE THROAT: MRS. GODDARD
WAS FULL OF CARE AND AFFECTION, MR. PERRY WAS TALKED OF, AND HARRIET
HERSELF WAS TOO ILL AND LOW TO RESIST THE AUTHORITY WHICH EXCLUDED HER
FROM THIS DELIGHTFUL ENGAGEMENT, THOUGH SHE COULD NOT SPEAK OF HER LOSS
WITHOUT MANY TEARS.

EMMA SAT WITH HER AS LONG AS SHE COULD, TO ATTEND HER IN MRS. GODDARD'S
UNAVOIDABLE ABSENCES, AND RAISE HER SPIRITS BY REPRESENTING HOW MUCH MR.
ELTON'S WOULD BE DEPRESSED WHEN HE KNEW HER STATE; AND LEFT HER AT LAST
TOLERABLY COMFORTABLE, IN THE SWEET DEPENDENCE OF HIS HAVING A MOST
COMFORTLESS VISIT, AND OF THEIR ALL MISSING HER VERY MUCH. SHE HAD NOT
ADVANCED MANY YARDS FROM MRS. GODDARD'S DOOR, WHEN SHE WAS MET BY MR.
ELTON HIMSELF, EVIDENTLY COMING TOWARDS IT, AND AS THEY WALKED ON SLOWLY
TOGETHER IN CONVERSATION ABOUT THE INVALID--OF WHOM HE, ON THE RUMOUR
OF CONSIDERABLE ILLNESS, HAD BEEN GOING TO INQUIRE, THAT HE MIGHT
CARRY SOME REPORT OF HER TO HARTFIELD--THEY WERE OVERTAKEN BY MR. JOHN
KNIGHTLEY RETURNING FROM THE DAILY VISIT TO DONWELL, WITH HIS TWO ELDEST
BOYS, WHOSE HEALTHY, GLOWING FACES SHEWED ALL THE BENEFIT OF A COUNTRY
RUN, AND SEEMED TO ENSURE A QUICK DESPATCH OF THE ROAST MUTTON AND RICE
PUDDING THEY WERE HASTENING HOME FOR. THEY JOINED COMPANY AND
PROCEEDED TOGETHER. EMMA WAS JUST DESCRIBING THE NATURE OF HER FRIEND'S
COMPLAINT;--"A THROAT VERY MUCH INFLAMED, WITH A GREAT DEAL OF HEAT
ABOUT HER, A QUICK, LOW PULSE, ETC. AND SHE WAS SORRY TO FIND FROM MRS.
GODDARD THAT HARRIET WAS LIABLE TO VERY BAD SORE-THROATS, AND HAD OFTEN
ALARMED HER WITH THEM." MR. ELTON LOOKED ALL ALARM ON THE OCCASION, AS
HE EXCLAIMED,

"A SORE-THROAT!--I HOPE NOT INFECTIOUS. I HOPE NOT OF A PUTRID
INFECTIOUS SORT. HAS PERRY SEEN HER? INDEED YOU SHOULD TAKE CARE OF
YOURSELF AS WELL AS OF YOUR FRIEND. LET ME ENTREAT YOU TO RUN NO RISKS.
WHY DOES NOT PERRY SEE HER?"

EMMA, WHO WAS NOT REALLY AT ALL FRIGHTENED HERSELF, TRANQUILLISED THIS
EXCESS OF APPREHENSION BY ASSURANCES OF MRS. GODDARD'S EXPERIENCE AND
CARE; BUT AS THERE MUST STILL REMAIN A DEGREE OF UNEASINESS WHICH SHE
COULD NOT WISH TO REASON AWAY, WHICH SHE WOULD RATHER FEED AND ASSIST
THAN NOT, SHE ADDED SOON AFTERWARDS--AS IF QUITE ANOTHER SUBJECT,

"IT IS SO COLD, SO VERY COLD--AND LOOKS AND FEELS SO VERY MUCH LIKE
SNOW, THAT IF IT WERE TO ANY OTHER PLACE OR WITH ANY OTHER PARTY, I
SHOULD REALLY TRY NOT TO GO OUT TO-DAY--AND DISSUADE MY FATHER FROM
VENTURING; BUT AS HE HAS MADE UP HIS MIND, AND DOES NOT SEEM TO FEEL THE
COLD HIMSELF, I DO NOT LIKE TO INTERFERE, AS I KNOW IT WOULD BE SO GREAT
A DISAPPOINTMENT TO MR. AND MRS. WESTON. BUT, UPON MY WORD, MR. ELTON,
IN YOUR CASE, I SHOULD CERTAINLY EXCUSE MYSELF. YOU APPEAR TO ME A
LITTLE HOARSE ALREADY, AND WHEN YOU CONSIDER WHAT DEMAND OF VOICE AND
WHAT FATIGUES TO-MORROW WILL BRING, I THINK IT WOULD BE NO MORE THAN
COMMON PRUDENCE TO STAY AT HOME AND TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF TO-NIGHT."

MR. ELTON LOOKED AS IF HE DID NOT VERY WELL KNOW WHAT ANSWER TO MAKE;
WHICH WAS EXACTLY THE CASE; FOR THOUGH VERY MUCH GRATIFIED BY THE KIND
CARE OF SUCH A FAIR LADY, AND NOT LIKING TO RESIST ANY ADVICE OF HER'S,
HE HAD NOT REALLY THE LEAST INCLINATION TO GIVE UP THE VISIT;--BUT EMMA,
TOO EAGER AND BUSY IN HER OWN PREVIOUS CONCEPTIONS AND VIEWS TO HEAR HIM
IMPARTIALLY, OR SEE HIM WITH CLEAR VISION, WAS VERY WELL SATISFIED WITH
HIS MUTTERING ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF ITS BEING "VERY COLD, CERTAINLY VERY
COLD," AND WALKED ON, REJOICING IN HAVING EXTRICATED HIM FROM RANDALLS,
AND SECURED HIM THE POWER OF SENDING TO INQUIRE AFTER HARRIET EVERY HOUR
OF THE EVENING.

"YOU DO QUITE RIGHT," SAID SHE;--"WE WILL MAKE YOUR APOLOGIES TO MR. AND
MRS. WESTON."

BUT HARDLY HAD SHE SO SPOKEN, WHEN SHE FOUND HER BROTHER WAS CIVILLY
OFFERING A SEAT IN HIS CARRIAGE, IF THE WEATHER WERE MR. ELTON'S ONLY
OBJECTION, AND MR. ELTON ACTUALLY ACCEPTING THE OFFER WITH MUCH PROMPT
SATISFACTION. IT WAS A DONE THING; MR. ELTON WAS TO GO, AND NEVER HAD
HIS BROAD HANDSOME FACE EXPRESSED MORE PLEASURE THAN AT THIS MOMENT;
NEVER HAD HIS SMILE BEEN STRONGER, NOR HIS EYES MORE EXULTING THAN WHEN
HE NEXT LOOKED AT HER.

"WELL," SAID SHE TO HERSELF, "THIS IS MOST STRANGE!--AFTER I HAD GOT
HIM OFF SO WELL, TO CHUSE TO GO INTO COMPANY, AND LEAVE HARRIET ILL
BEHIND!--MOST STRANGE INDEED!--BUT THERE IS, I BELIEVE, IN MANY MEN,
ESPECIALLY SINGLE MEN, SUCH AN INCLINATION--SUCH A PASSION FOR DINING
OUT--A DINNER ENGAGEMENT IS SO HIGH IN THE CLASS OF THEIR PLEASURES,
THEIR EMPLOYMENTS, THEIR DIGNITIES, ALMOST THEIR DUTIES, THAT ANY
THING GIVES WAY TO IT--AND THIS MUST BE THE CASE WITH MR. ELTON; A MOST
VALUABLE, AMIABLE, PLEASING YOUNG MAN UNDOUBTEDLY, AND VERY MUCH IN LOVE
WITH HARRIET; BUT STILL, HE CANNOT REFUSE AN INVITATION, HE MUST DINE
OUT WHEREVER HE IS ASKED. WHAT A STRANGE THING LOVE IS! HE CAN SEE READY
WIT IN HARRIET, BUT WILL NOT DINE ALONE FOR HER."

SOON AFTERWARDS MR. ELTON QUITTED THEM, AND SHE COULD NOT BUT DO HIM
THE JUSTICE OF FEELING THAT THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF SENTIMENT IN HIS
MANNER OF NAMING HARRIET AT PARTING; IN THE TONE OF HIS VOICE WHILE
ASSURING HER THAT HE SHOULD CALL AT MRS. GODDARD'S FOR NEWS OF HER FAIR
FRIEND, THE LAST THING BEFORE HE PREPARED FOR THE HAPPINESS OF MEETING
HER AGAIN, WHEN HE HOPED TO BE ABLE TO GIVE A BETTER REPORT; AND
HE SIGHED AND SMILED HIMSELF OFF IN A WAY THAT LEFT THE BALANCE OF
APPROBATION MUCH IN HIS FAVOUR.

AFTER A FEW MINUTES OF ENTIRE SILENCE BETWEEN THEM, JOHN KNIGHTLEY BEGAN
WITH--

"I NEVER IN MY LIFE SAW A MAN MORE INTENT ON BEING AGREEABLE THAN MR.
ELTON. IT IS DOWNRIGHT LABOUR TO HIM WHERE LADIES ARE CONCERNED. WITH
MEN HE CAN BE RATIONAL AND UNAFFECTED, BUT WHEN HE HAS LADIES TO PLEASE,
EVERY FEATURE WORKS."

"MR. ELTON'S MANNERS ARE NOT PERFECT," REPLIED EMMA; "BUT WHERE THERE IS
A WISH TO PLEASE, ONE OUGHT TO OVERLOOK, AND ONE DOES OVERLOOK A GREAT
DEAL. WHERE A MAN DOES HIS BEST WITH ONLY MODERATE POWERS, HE WILL
HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OVER NEGLIGENT SUPERIORITY. THERE IS SUCH PERFECT
GOOD-TEMPER AND GOOD-WILL IN MR. ELTON AS ONE CANNOT BUT VALUE."

"YES," SAID MR. JOHN KNIGHTLEY PRESENTLY, WITH SOME SLYNESS, "HE SEEMS
TO HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF GOOD-WILL TOWARDS YOU."

"ME!" SHE REPLIED WITH A SMILE OF ASTONISHMENT, "ARE YOU IMAGINING ME TO
BE MR. ELTON'S OBJECT?"

"SUCH AN IMAGINATION HAS CROSSED ME, I OWN, EMMA; AND IF IT NEVER
OCCURRED TO YOU BEFORE, YOU MAY AS WELL TAKE IT INTO CONSIDERATION NOW."

"MR. ELTON IN LOVE WITH ME!--WHAT AN IDEA!"

"I DO NOT SAY IT IS SO; BUT YOU WILL DO WELL TO CONSIDER WHETHER IT
IS SO OR NOT, AND TO REGULATE YOUR BEHAVIOUR ACCORDINGLY. I THINK YOUR
MANNERS TO HIM ENCOURAGING. I SPEAK AS A FRIEND, EMMA. YOU HAD BETTER
LOOK ABOUT YOU, AND ASCERTAIN WHAT YOU DO, AND WHAT YOU MEAN TO DO."

"I THANK YOU; BUT I ASSURE YOU YOU ARE QUITE MISTAKEN. MR. ELTON AND
I ARE VERY GOOD FRIENDS, AND NOTHING MORE;" AND SHE WALKED ON, AMUSING
HERSELF IN THE CONSIDERATION OF THE BLUNDERS WHICH OFTEN ARISE FROM A
PARTIAL KNOWLEDGE OF CIRCUMSTANCES, OF THE MISTAKES WHICH PEOPLE OF HIGH
PRETENSIONS TO JUDGMENT ARE FOR EVER FALLING INTO; AND NOT VERY WELL
PLEASED WITH HER BROTHER FOR IMAGINING HER BLIND AND IGNORANT, AND IN
WANT OF COUNSEL. HE SAID NO MORE.

MR. WOODHOUSE HAD SO COMPLETELY MADE UP HIS MIND TO THE VISIT, THAT IN
SPITE OF THE INCREASING COLDNESS, HE SEEMED TO HAVE NO IDEA OF SHRINKING
FROM IT, AND SET FORWARD AT LAST MOST PUNCTUALLY WITH HIS ELDEST
DAUGHTER IN HIS OWN CARRIAGE, WITH LESS APPARENT CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE
WEATHER THAN EITHER OF THE OTHERS; TOO FULL OF THE WONDER OF HIS OWN
GOING, AND THE PLEASURE IT WAS TO AFFORD AT RANDALLS TO SEE THAT IT WAS
COLD, AND TOO WELL WRAPT UP TO FEEL IT. THE COLD, HOWEVER, WAS SEVERE;
AND BY THE TIME THE SECOND CARRIAGE WAS IN MOTION, A FEW FLAKES OF SNOW
WERE FINDING THEIR WAY DOWN, AND THE SKY HAD THE APPEARANCE OF BEING SO
OVERCHARGED AS TO WANT ONLY A MILDER AIR TO PRODUCE A VERY WHITE WORLD
IN A VERY SHORT TIME.

EMMA SOON SAW THAT HER COMPANION WAS NOT IN THE HAPPIEST HUMOUR. THE
PREPARING AND THE GOING ABROAD IN SUCH WEATHER, WITH THE SACRIFICE OF
HIS CHILDREN AFTER DINNER, WERE EVILS, WERE DISAGREEABLES AT LEAST,
WHICH MR. JOHN KNIGHTLEY DID NOT BY ANY MEANS LIKE; HE ANTICIPATED
NOTHING IN THE VISIT THAT COULD BE AT ALL WORTH THE PURCHASE; AND THE
WHOLE OF THEIR DRIVE TO THE VICARAGE WAS SPENT BY HIM IN EXPRESSING HIS
DISCONTENT.

"A MAN," SAID HE, "MUST HAVE A VERY GOOD OPINION OF HIMSELF WHEN HE ASKS
PEOPLE TO LEAVE THEIR OWN FIRESIDE, AND ENCOUNTER SUCH A DAY AS
THIS, FOR THE SAKE OF COMING TO SEE HIM. HE MUST THINK HIMSELF A MOST
AGREEABLE FELLOW; I COULD NOT DO SUCH A THING. IT IS THE GREATEST
ABSURDITY--ACTUALLY SNOWING AT THIS MOMENT!--THE FOLLY OF NOT ALLOWING
PEOPLE TO BE COMFORTABLE AT HOME--AND THE FOLLY OF PEOPLE'S NOT STAYING
COMFORTABLY AT HOME WHEN THEY CAN! IF WE WERE OBLIGED TO GO OUT SUCH
AN EVENING AS THIS, BY ANY CALL OF DUTY OR BUSINESS, WHAT A HARDSHIP WE
SHOULD DEEM IT;--AND HERE ARE WE, PROBABLY WITH RATHER THINNER CLOTHING
THAN USUAL, SETTING FORWARD VOLUNTARILY, WITHOUT EXCUSE, IN DEFIANCE OF
THE VOICE OF NATURE, WHICH TELLS MAN, IN EVERY THING GIVEN TO HIS VIEW
OR HIS FEELINGS, TO STAY AT HOME HIMSELF, AND KEEP ALL UNDER SHELTER
THAT HE CAN;--HERE ARE WE SETTING FORWARD TO SPEND FIVE DULL HOURS IN
ANOTHER MAN'S HOUSE, WITH NOTHING TO SAY OR TO HEAR THAT WAS NOT SAID
AND HEARD YESTERDAY, AND MAY NOT BE SAID AND HEARD AGAIN TO-MORROW.
GOING IN DISMAL WEATHER, TO RETURN PROBABLY IN WORSE;--FOUR HORSES AND
FOUR SERVANTS TAKEN OUT FOR NOTHING BUT TO CONVEY FIVE IDLE, SHIVERING
CREATURES INTO COLDER ROOMS AND WORSE COMPANY THAN THEY MIGHT HAVE HAD
AT HOME."

EMMA DID NOT FIND HERSELF EQUAL TO GIVE THE PLEASED ASSENT, WHICH NO
DOUBT HE WAS IN THE HABIT OF RECEIVING, TO EMULATE THE "VERY TRUE,
MY LOVE," WHICH MUST HAVE BEEN USUALLY ADMINISTERED BY HIS TRAVELLING
COMPANION; BUT SHE HAD RESOLUTION ENOUGH TO REFRAIN FROM MAKING
ANY ANSWER AT ALL. SHE COULD NOT BE COMPLYING, SHE DREADED BEING
QUARRELSOME; HER HEROISM REACHED ONLY TO SILENCE. SHE ALLOWED HIM TO
TALK, AND ARRANGED THE GLASSES, AND WRAPPED HERSELF UP, WITHOUT OPENING
HER LIPS.

THEY ARRIVED, THE CARRIAGE TURNED, THE STEP WAS LET DOWN, AND MR. ELTON,
SPRUCE, BLACK, AND SMILING, WAS WITH THEM INSTANTLY. EMMA THOUGHT WITH
PLEASURE OF SOME CHANGE OF SUBJECT. MR. ELTON WAS ALL OBLIGATION AND
CHEERFULNESS; HE WAS SO VERY CHEERFUL IN HIS CIVILITIES INDEED, THAT SHE
BEGAN TO THINK HE MUST HAVE RECEIVED A DIFFERENT ACCOUNT OF HARRIET FROM
WHAT HAD REACHED HER. SHE HAD SENT WHILE DRESSING, AND THE ANSWER HAD
BEEN, "MUCH THE SAME--NOT BETTER."

"MY REPORT FROM MRS. GODDARD'S," SAID SHE PRESENTLY, "WAS NOT SO
PLEASANT AS I HAD HOPED--'NOT BETTER' WAS MY ANSWER."

HIS FACE LENGTHENED IMMEDIATELY; AND HIS VOICE WAS THE VOICE OF
SENTIMENT AS HE ANSWERED.

"OH! NO--I AM GRIEVED TO FIND--I WAS ON THE POINT OF TELLING YOU THAT
WHEN I CALLED AT MRS. GODDARD'S DOOR, WHICH I DID THE VERY LAST THING
BEFORE I RETURNED TO DRESS, I WAS TOLD THAT MISS SMITH WAS NOT BETTER,
BY NO MEANS BETTER, RATHER WORSE. VERY MUCH GRIEVED AND CONCERNED--I
HAD FLATTERED MYSELF THAT SHE MUST BE BETTER AFTER SUCH A CORDIAL AS I
KNEW HAD BEEN GIVEN HER IN THE MORNING."

EMMA SMILED AND ANSWERED--"MY VISIT WAS OF USE TO THE NERVOUS PART OF
HER COMPLAINT, I HOPE; BUT NOT EVEN I CAN CHARM AWAY A SORE THROAT;
IT IS A MOST SEVERE COLD INDEED. MR. PERRY HAS BEEN WITH HER, AS YOU
PROBABLY HEARD."

"YES--I IMAGINED--THAT IS--I DID NOT--"

"HE HAS BEEN USED TO HER IN THESE COMPLAINTS, AND I HOPE TO-MORROW
MORNING WILL BRING US BOTH A MORE COMFORTABLE REPORT. BUT IT IS
IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO FEEL UNEASINESS. SUCH A SAD LOSS TO OUR PARTY TO-DAY!"

"DREADFUL!--EXACTLY SO, INDEED.--SHE WILL BE MISSED EVERY MOMENT."

THIS WAS VERY PROPER; THE SIGH WHICH ACCOMPANIED IT WAS REALLY
ESTIMABLE; BUT IT SHOULD HAVE LASTED LONGER. EMMA WAS RATHER IN DISMAY
WHEN ONLY HALF A MINUTE AFTERWARDS HE BEGAN TO SPEAK OF OTHER THINGS,
AND IN A VOICE OF THE GREATEST ALACRITY AND ENJOYMENT.

"WHAT AN EXCELLENT DEVICE," SAID HE, "THE USE OF A SHEEPSKIN FOR
CARRIAGES. HOW VERY COMFORTABLE THEY MAKE IT;--IMPOSSIBLE TO FEEL COLD
WITH SUCH PRECAUTIONS. THE CONTRIVANCES OF MODERN DAYS INDEED HAVE
RENDERED A GENTLEMAN'S CARRIAGE PERFECTLY COMPLETE. ONE IS SO FENCED
AND GUARDED FROM THE WEATHER, THAT NOT A BREATH OF AIR CAN FIND ITS WAY
UNPERMITTED. WEATHER BECOMES ABSOLUTELY OF NO CONSEQUENCE. IT IS A VERY
COLD AFTERNOON--BUT IN THIS CARRIAGE WE KNOW NOTHING OF THE MATTER.--HA!
SNOWS A LITTLE I SEE."

"YES," SAID JOHN KNIGHTLEY, "AND I THINK WE SHALL HAVE A GOOD DEAL OF
IT."

"CHRISTMAS WEATHER," OBSERVED MR. ELTON. "QUITE SEASONABLE; AND
EXTREMELY FORTUNATE WE MAY THINK OURSELVES THAT IT DID NOT BEGIN
YESTERDAY, AND PREVENT THIS DAY'S PARTY, WHICH IT MIGHT VERY POSSIBLY
HAVE DONE, FOR MR. WOODHOUSE WOULD HARDLY HAVE VENTURED HAD THERE BEEN
MUCH SNOW ON THE GROUND; BUT NOW IT IS OF NO CONSEQUENCE. THIS IS QUITE
THE SEASON INDEED FOR FRIENDLY MEETINGS. AT CHRISTMAS EVERY BODY INVITES
THEIR FRIENDS ABOUT THEM, AND PEOPLE THINK LITTLE OF EVEN THE WORST
WEATHER. I WAS SNOWED UP AT A FRIEND'S HOUSE ONCE FOR A WEEK. NOTHING
COULD BE PLEASANTER. I WENT FOR ONLY ONE NIGHT, AND COULD NOT GET AWAY
TILL THAT VERY DAY SE'NNIGHT."

MR. JOHN KNIGHTLEY LOOKED AS IF HE DID NOT COMPREHEND THE PLEASURE, BUT
SAID ONLY, COOLLY,

"I CANNOT WISH TO BE SNOWED UP A WEEK AT RANDALLS."

AT ANOTHER TIME EMMA MIGHT HAVE BEEN AMUSED, BUT SHE WAS TOO MUCH
ASTONISHED NOW AT MR. ELTON'S SPIRITS FOR OTHER FEELINGS. HARRIET SEEMED
QUITE FORGOTTEN IN THE EXPECTATION OF A PLEASANT PARTY.

"WE ARE SURE OF EXCELLENT FIRES," CONTINUED HE, "AND EVERY THING IN THE
GREATEST COMFORT. CHARMING PEOPLE, MR. AND MRS. WESTON;--MRS. WESTON
INDEED IS MUCH BEYOND PRAISE, AND HE IS EXACTLY WHAT ONE VALUES, SO
HOSPITABLE, AND SO FOND OF SOCIETY;--IT WILL BE A SMALL PARTY, BUT WHERE
SMALL PARTIES ARE SELECT, THEY ARE PERHAPS THE MOST AGREEABLE OF ANY.
MR. WESTON'S DINING-ROOM DOES NOT ACCOMMODATE MORE THAN TEN COMFORTABLY;
AND FOR MY PART, I WOULD RATHER, UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES, FALL SHORT BY
TWO THAN EXCEED BY TWO. I THINK YOU WILL AGREE WITH ME, (TURNING WITH
A SOFT AIR TO EMMA,) I THINK I SHALL CERTAINLY HAVE YOUR APPROBATION,
THOUGH MR. KNIGHTLEY PERHAPS, FROM BEING USED TO THE LARGE PARTIES OF
LONDON, MAY NOT QUITE ENTER INTO OUR FEELINGS."

"I KNOW NOTHING OF THE LARGE PARTIES OF LONDON, SIR--I NEVER DINE WITH
ANY BODY."

"INDEED! (IN A TONE OF WONDER AND PITY,) I HAD NO IDEA THAT THE LAW HAD
BEEN SO GREAT A SLAVERY. WELL, SIR, THE TIME MUST COME WHEN YOU WILL
BE PAID FOR ALL THIS, WHEN YOU WILL HAVE LITTLE LABOUR AND GREAT
ENJOYMENT."

"MY FIRST ENJOYMENT," REPLIED JOHN KNIGHTLEY, AS THEY PASSED THROUGH THE
SWEEP-GATE, "WILL BE TO FIND MYSELF SAFE AT HARTFIELD AGAIN."



CHAPTER XIV


SOME CHANGE OF COUNTENANCE WAS NECESSARY FOR EACH GENTLEMAN AS THEY
WALKED INTO MRS. WESTON'S DRAWING-ROOM;--MR. ELTON MUST COMPOSE HIS
JOYOUS LOOKS, AND MR. JOHN KNIGHTLEY DISPERSE HIS ILL-HUMOUR. MR.
ELTON MUST SMILE LESS, AND MR. JOHN KNIGHTLEY MORE, TO FIT THEM FOR THE
PLACE.--EMMA ONLY MIGHT BE AS NATURE PROMPTED, AND SHEW HERSELF JUST AS
HAPPY AS SHE WAS. TO HER IT WAS REAL ENJOYMENT TO BE WITH THE WESTONS.
MR. WESTON WAS A GREAT FAVOURITE, AND THERE WAS NOT A CREATURE IN THE
WORLD TO WHOM SHE SPOKE WITH SUCH UNRESERVE, AS TO HIS WIFE; NOT ANY
ONE, TO WHOM SHE RELATED WITH SUCH CONVICTION OF BEING LISTENED TO AND
UNDERSTOOD, OF BEING ALWAYS INTERESTING AND ALWAYS INTELLIGIBLE, THE
LITTLE AFFAIRS, ARRANGEMENTS, PERPLEXITIES, AND PLEASURES OF HER FATHER
AND HERSELF. SHE COULD TELL NOTHING OF HARTFIELD, IN WHICH MRS. WESTON
HAD NOT A LIVELY CONCERN; AND HALF AN HOUR'S UNINTERRUPTED COMMUNICATION
OF ALL THOSE LITTLE MATTERS ON WHICH THE DAILY HAPPINESS OF PRIVATE LIFE
DEPENDS, WAS ONE OF THE FIRST GRATIFICATIONS OF EACH.

THIS WAS A PLEASURE WHICH PERHAPS THE WHOLE DAY'S VISIT MIGHT NOT
AFFORD, WHICH CERTAINLY DID NOT BELONG TO THE PRESENT HALF-HOUR; BUT THE
VERY SIGHT OF MRS. WESTON, HER SMILE, HER TOUCH, HER VOICE WAS GRATEFUL
TO EMMA, AND SHE DETERMINED TO THINK AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE OF MR.
ELTON'S ODDITIES, OR OF ANY THING ELSE UNPLEASANT, AND ENJOY ALL THAT
WAS ENJOYABLE TO THE UTMOST.

THE MISFORTUNE OF HARRIET'S COLD HAD BEEN PRETTY WELL GONE THROUGH
BEFORE HER ARRIVAL. MR. WOODHOUSE HAD BEEN SAFELY SEATED LONG ENOUGH
TO GIVE THE HISTORY OF IT, BESIDES ALL THE HISTORY OF HIS OWN AND
ISABELLA'S COMING, AND OF EMMA'S BEING TO FOLLOW, AND HAD INDEED JUST
GOT TO THE END OF HIS SATISFACTION THAT JAMES SHOULD COME AND SEE HIS
DAUGHTER, WHEN THE OTHERS APPEARED, AND MRS. WESTON, WHO HAD BEEN ALMOST
WHOLLY ENGROSSED BY HER ATTENTIONS TO HIM, WAS ABLE TO TURN AWAY AND
WELCOME HER DEAR EMMA.

EMMA'S PROJECT OF FORGETTING MR. ELTON FOR A WHILE MADE HER RATHER SORRY
TO FIND, WHEN THEY HAD ALL TAKEN THEIR PLACES, THAT HE WAS CLOSE TO HER.
THE DIFFICULTY WAS GREAT OF DRIVING HIS STRANGE INSENSIBILITY TOWARDS
HARRIET, FROM HER MIND, WHILE HE NOT ONLY SAT AT HER ELBOW, BUT
WAS CONTINUALLY OBTRUDING HIS HAPPY COUNTENANCE ON HER NOTICE, AND
SOLICITOUSLY ADDRESSING HER UPON EVERY OCCASION. INSTEAD OF FORGETTING
HIM, HIS BEHAVIOUR WAS SUCH THAT SHE COULD NOT AVOID THE INTERNAL
SUGGESTION OF "CAN IT REALLY BE AS MY BROTHER IMAGINED? CAN IT BE
POSSIBLE FOR THIS MAN TO BE BEGINNING TO TRANSFER HIS AFFECTIONS FROM
HARRIET TO ME?--ABSURD AND INSUFFERABLE!"--YET HE WOULD BE SO ANXIOUS
FOR HER BEING PERFECTLY WARM, WOULD BE SO INTERESTED ABOUT HER FATHER,
AND SO DELIGHTED WITH MRS. WESTON; AND AT LAST WOULD BEGIN ADMIRING HER
DRAWINGS WITH SO MUCH ZEAL AND SO LITTLE KNOWLEDGE AS SEEMED TERRIBLY
LIKE A WOULD-BE LOVER, AND MADE IT SOME EFFORT WITH HER TO PRESERVE HER
GOOD MANNERS. FOR HER OWN SAKE SHE COULD NOT BE RUDE; AND FOR HARRIET'S,
IN THE HOPE THAT ALL WOULD YET TURN OUT RIGHT, SHE WAS EVEN POSITIVELY
CIVIL; BUT IT WAS AN EFFORT; ESPECIALLY AS SOMETHING WAS GOING ON
AMONGST THE OTHERS, IN THE MOST OVERPOWERING PERIOD OF MR. ELTON'S
NONSENSE, WHICH SHE PARTICULARLY WISHED TO LISTEN TO. SHE HEARD ENOUGH
TO KNOW THAT MR. WESTON WAS GIVING SOME INFORMATION ABOUT HIS SON; SHE
HEARD THE WORDS "MY SON," AND "FRANK," AND "MY SON," REPEATED SEVERAL
TIMES OVER; AND, FROM A FEW OTHER HALF-SYLLABLES VERY MUCH SUSPECTED
THAT HE WAS ANNOUNCING AN EARLY VISIT FROM HIS SON; BUT BEFORE SHE COULD
QUIET MR. ELTON, THE SUBJECT WAS SO COMPLETELY PAST THAT ANY REVIVING
QUESTION FROM HER WOULD HAVE BEEN AWKWARD.

NOW, IT SO HAPPENED THAT IN SPITE OF EMMA'S RESOLUTION OF NEVER
MARRYING, THERE WAS SOMETHING IN THE NAME, IN THE IDEA OF MR.
FRANK CHURCHILL, WHICH ALWAYS INTERESTED HER. SHE HAD FREQUENTLY
THOUGHT--ESPECIALLY SINCE HIS FATHER'S MARRIAGE WITH MISS TAYLOR--THAT
IF SHE WERE TO MARRY, HE WAS THE VERY PERSON TO SUIT HER IN AGE,
CHARACTER AND CONDITION. HE SEEMED BY THIS CONNEXION BETWEEN THE
FAMILIES, QUITE TO BELONG TO HER. SHE COULD NOT BUT SUPPOSE IT TO BE
A MATCH THAT EVERY BODY WHO KNEW THEM MUST THINK OF. THAT MR. AND MRS.
WESTON DID THINK OF IT, SHE WAS VERY STRONGLY PERSUADED; AND THOUGH
NOT MEANING TO BE INDUCED BY HIM, OR BY ANY BODY ELSE, TO GIVE UP A
SITUATION WHICH SHE BELIEVED MORE REPLETE WITH GOOD THAN ANY SHE COULD
CHANGE IT FOR, SHE HAD A GREAT CURIOSITY TO SEE HIM, A DECIDED INTENTION
OF FINDING HIM PLEASANT, OF BEING LIKED BY HIM TO A CERTAIN DEGREE, AND
A SORT OF PLEASURE IN THE IDEA OF THEIR BEING COUPLED IN THEIR FRIENDS'
IMAGINATIONS.

WITH SUCH SENSATIONS, MR. ELTON'S CIVILITIES WERE DREADFULLY ILL-TIMED;
BUT SHE HAD THE COMFORT OF APPEARING VERY POLITE, WHILE FEELING VERY
CROSS--AND OF THINKING THAT THE REST OF THE VISIT COULD NOT POSSIBLY
PASS WITHOUT BRINGING FORWARD THE SAME INFORMATION AGAIN, OR THE
SUBSTANCE OF IT, FROM THE OPEN-HEARTED MR. WESTON.--SO IT PROVED;--FOR
WHEN HAPPILY RELEASED FROM MR. ELTON, AND SEATED BY MR. WESTON,
AT DINNER, HE MADE USE OF THE VERY FIRST INTERVAL IN THE CARES OF
HOSPITALITY, THE VERY FIRST LEISURE FROM THE SADDLE OF MUTTON, TO SAY TO
HER,

"WE WANT ONLY TWO MORE TO BE JUST THE RIGHT NUMBER. I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE
TWO MORE HERE,--YOUR PRETTY LITTLE FRIEND, MISS SMITH, AND MY SON--AND
THEN I SHOULD SAY WE WERE QUITE COMPLETE. I BELIEVE YOU DID NOT HEAR ME
TELLING THE OTHERS IN THE DRAWING-ROOM THAT WE ARE EXPECTING FRANK.
I HAD A LETTER FROM HIM THIS MORNING, AND HE WILL BE WITH US WITHIN A
FORTNIGHT."

EMMA SPOKE WITH A VERY PROPER DEGREE OF PLEASURE; AND FULLY ASSENTED TO
HIS PROPOSITION OF MR. FRANK CHURCHILL AND MISS SMITH MAKING THEIR PARTY
QUITE COMPLETE.

"HE HAS BEEN WANTING TO COME TO US," CONTINUED MR. WESTON, "EVER SINCE
SEPTEMBER: EVERY LETTER HAS BEEN FULL OF IT; BUT HE CANNOT COMMAND HIS
OWN TIME. HE HAS THOSE TO PLEASE WHO MUST BE PLEASED, AND WHO (BETWEEN
OURSELVES) ARE SOMETIMES TO BE PLEASED ONLY BY A GOOD MANY SACRIFICES.
BUT NOW I HAVE NO DOUBT OF SEEING HIM HERE ABOUT THE SECOND WEEK IN
JANUARY."

"WHAT A VERY GREAT PLEASURE IT WILL BE TO YOU! AND MRS. WESTON IS SO
ANXIOUS TO BE ACQUAINTED WITH HIM, THAT SHE MUST BE ALMOST AS HAPPY AS
YOURSELF."

"YES, SHE WOULD BE, BUT THAT SHE THINKS THERE WILL BE ANOTHER PUT-OFF.
SHE DOES NOT DEPEND UPON HIS COMING SO MUCH AS I DO: BUT SHE DOES NOT
KNOW THE PARTIES SO WELL AS I DO. THE CASE, YOU SEE, IS--(BUT THIS IS
QUITE BETWEEN OURSELVES: I DID NOT MENTION A SYLLABLE OF IT IN THE OTHER
ROOM. THERE ARE SECRETS IN ALL FAMILIES, YOU KNOW)--THE CASE IS, THAT A
PARTY OF FRIENDS ARE INVITED TO PAY A VISIT AT ENSCOMBE IN JANUARY; AND
THAT FRANK'S COMING DEPENDS UPON THEIR BEING PUT OFF. IF THEY ARE NOT
PUT OFF, HE CANNOT STIR. BUT I KNOW THEY WILL, BECAUSE IT IS A FAMILY
THAT A CERTAIN LADY, OF SOME CONSEQUENCE, AT ENSCOMBE, HAS A PARTICULAR
DISLIKE TO: AND THOUGH IT IS THOUGHT NECESSARY TO INVITE THEM ONCE IN
TWO OR THREE YEARS, THEY ALWAYS ARE PUT OFF WHEN IT COMES TO THE POINT.
I HAVE NOT THE SMALLEST DOUBT OF THE ISSUE. I AM AS CONFIDENT OF SEEING
FRANK HERE BEFORE THE MIDDLE OF JANUARY, AS I AM OF BEING HERE MYSELF:
BUT YOUR GOOD FRIEND THERE (NODDING TOWARDS THE UPPER END OF THE TABLE)
HAS SO FEW VAGARIES HERSELF, AND HAS BEEN SO LITTLE USED TO THEM AT
HARTFIELD, THAT SHE CANNOT CALCULATE ON THEIR EFFECTS, AS I HAVE BEEN
LONG IN THE PRACTICE OF DOING."

"I AM SORRY THERE SHOULD BE ANY THING LIKE DOUBT IN THE CASE," REPLIED
EMMA; "BUT AM DISPOSED TO SIDE WITH YOU, MR. WESTON. IF YOU THINK HE
WILL COME, I SHALL THINK SO TOO; FOR YOU KNOW ENSCOMBE."

"YES--I HAVE SOME RIGHT TO THAT KNOWLEDGE; THOUGH I HAVE NEVER BEEN AT
THE PLACE IN MY LIFE.--SHE IS AN ODD WOMAN!--BUT I NEVER ALLOW MYSELF
TO SPEAK ILL OF HER, ON FRANK'S ACCOUNT; FOR I DO BELIEVE HER TO BE VERY
FOND OF HIM. I USED TO THINK SHE WAS NOT CAPABLE OF BEING FOND OF
ANY BODY, EXCEPT HERSELF: BUT SHE HAS ALWAYS BEEN KIND TO HIM (IN HER
WAY--ALLOWING FOR LITTLE WHIMS AND CAPRICES, AND EXPECTING EVERY THING
TO BE AS SHE LIKES). AND IT IS NO SMALL CREDIT, IN MY OPINION, TO HIM,
THAT HE SHOULD EXCITE SUCH AN AFFECTION; FOR, THOUGH I WOULD NOT SAY
IT TO ANY BODY ELSE, SHE HAS NO MORE HEART THAN A STONE TO PEOPLE IN
GENERAL; AND THE DEVIL OF A TEMPER."

EMMA LIKED THE SUBJECT SO WELL, THAT SHE BEGAN UPON IT, TO MRS. WESTON,
VERY SOON AFTER THEIR MOVING INTO THE DRAWING-ROOM: WISHING HER JOY--YET
OBSERVING, THAT SHE KNEW THE FIRST MEETING MUST BE RATHER ALARMING.--
MRS. WESTON AGREED TO IT; BUT ADDED, THAT SHE SHOULD BE VERY GLAD TO BE
SECURE OF UNDERGOING THE ANXIETY OF A FIRST MEETING AT THE TIME TALKED
OF: "FOR I CANNOT DEPEND UPON HIS COMING. I CANNOT BE SO SANGUINE AS
MR. WESTON. I AM VERY MUCH AFRAID THAT IT WILL ALL END IN NOTHING. MR.
WESTON, I DARE SAY, HAS BEEN TELLING YOU EXACTLY HOW THE MATTER STANDS?"

"YES--IT SEEMS TO DEPEND UPON NOTHING BUT THE ILL-HUMOUR OF MRS.
CHURCHILL, WHICH I IMAGINE TO BE THE MOST CERTAIN THING IN THE WORLD."

"MY EMMA!" REPLIED MRS. WESTON, SMILING, "WHAT IS THE CERTAINTY
OF CAPRICE?" THEN TURNING TO ISABELLA, WHO HAD NOT BEEN ATTENDING
BEFORE--"YOU MUST KNOW, MY DEAR MRS. KNIGHTLEY, THAT WE ARE BY NO MEANS
SO SURE OF SEEING MR. FRANK CHURCHILL, IN MY OPINION, AS HIS FATHER
THINKS. IT DEPENDS ENTIRELY UPON HIS AUNT'S SPIRITS AND PLEASURE; IN
SHORT, UPON HER TEMPER. TO YOU--TO MY TWO DAUGHTERS--I MAY VENTURE ON
THE TRUTH. MRS. CHURCHILL RULES AT ENSCOMBE, AND IS A VERY ODD-TEMPERED
WOMAN; AND HIS COMING NOW, DEPENDS UPON HER BEING WILLING TO SPARE HIM."

"OH, MRS. CHURCHILL; EVERY BODY KNOWS MRS. CHURCHILL," REPLIED ISABELLA:
"AND I AM SURE I NEVER THINK OF THAT POOR YOUNG MAN WITHOUT THE GREATEST
COMPASSION. TO BE CONSTANTLY LIVING WITH AN ILL-TEMPERED PERSON, MUST
BE DREADFUL. IT IS WHAT WE HAPPILY HAVE NEVER KNOWN ANY THING OF; BUT
IT MUST BE A LIFE OF MISERY. WHAT A BLESSING, THAT SHE NEVER HAD ANY
CHILDREN! POOR LITTLE CREATURES, HOW UNHAPPY SHE WOULD HAVE MADE THEM!"

EMMA WISHED SHE HAD BEEN ALONE WITH MRS. WESTON. SHE SHOULD THEN HAVE
HEARD MORE: MRS. WESTON WOULD SPEAK TO HER, WITH A DEGREE OF UNRESERVE
WHICH SHE WOULD NOT HAZARD WITH ISABELLA; AND, SHE REALLY BELIEVED,
WOULD SCARCELY TRY TO CONCEAL ANY THING RELATIVE TO THE CHURCHILLS
FROM HER, EXCEPTING THOSE VIEWS ON THE YOUNG MAN, OF WHICH HER OWN
IMAGINATION HAD ALREADY GIVEN HER SUCH INSTINCTIVE KNOWLEDGE. BUT AT
PRESENT THERE WAS NOTHING MORE TO BE SAID. MR. WOODHOUSE VERY SOON
FOLLOWED THEM INTO THE DRAWING-ROOM. TO BE SITTING LONG AFTER
DINNER, WAS A CONFINEMENT THAT HE COULD NOT ENDURE. NEITHER WINE NOR
CONVERSATION WAS ANY THING TO HIM; AND GLADLY DID HE MOVE TO THOSE WITH
WHOM HE WAS ALWAYS COMFORTABLE.

WHILE HE TALKED TO ISABELLA, HOWEVER, EMMA FOUND AN OPPORTUNITY OF
SAYING,

"AND SO YOU DO NOT CONSIDER THIS VISIT FROM YOUR SON AS BY ANY MEANS
CERTAIN. I AM SORRY FOR IT. THE INTRODUCTION MUST BE UNPLEASANT,
WHENEVER IT TAKES PLACE; AND THE SOONER IT COULD BE OVER, THE BETTER."

"YES; AND EVERY DELAY MAKES ONE MORE APPREHENSIVE OF OTHER DELAYS. EVEN
IF THIS FAMILY, THE BRAITHWAITES, ARE PUT OFF, I AM STILL AFRAID THAT
SOME EXCUSE MAY BE FOUND FOR DISAPPOINTING US. I CANNOT BEAR TO IMAGINE
ANY RELUCTANCE ON HIS SIDE; BUT I AM SURE THERE IS A GREAT WISH ON
THE CHURCHILLS' TO KEEP HIM TO THEMSELVES. THERE IS JEALOUSY. THEY
ARE JEALOUS EVEN OF HIS REGARD FOR HIS FATHER. IN SHORT, I CAN FEEL NO
DEPENDENCE ON HIS COMING, AND I WISH MR. WESTON WERE LESS SANGUINE."

"HE OUGHT TO COME," SAID EMMA. "IF HE COULD STAY ONLY A COUPLE OF DAYS,
HE OUGHT TO COME; AND ONE CAN HARDLY CONCEIVE A YOUNG MAN'S NOT HAVING
IT IN HIS POWER TO DO AS MUCH AS THAT. A YOUNG WOMAN, IF SHE FALL INTO
BAD HANDS, MAY BE TEASED, AND KEPT AT A DISTANCE FROM THOSE SHE WANTS
TO BE WITH; BUT ONE CANNOT COMPREHEND A YOUNG MAN'S BEING UNDER SUCH
RESTRAINT, AS NOT TO BE ABLE TO SPEND A WEEK WITH HIS FATHER, IF HE
LIKES IT."

"ONE OUGHT TO BE AT ENSCOMBE, AND KNOW THE WAYS OF THE FAMILY, BEFORE
ONE DECIDES UPON WHAT HE CAN DO," REPLIED MRS. WESTON. "ONE OUGHT TO
USE THE SAME CAUTION, PERHAPS, IN JUDGING OF THE CONDUCT OF ANY ONE
INDIVIDUAL OF ANY ONE FAMILY; BUT ENSCOMBE, I BELIEVE, CERTAINLY MUST
NOT BE JUDGED BY GENERAL RULES: SHE IS SO VERY UNREASONABLE; AND EVERY
THING GIVES WAY TO HER."

"BUT SHE IS SO FOND OF THE NEPHEW: HE IS SO VERY GREAT A FAVOURITE. NOW,
ACCORDING TO MY IDEA OF MRS. CHURCHILL, IT WOULD BE MOST NATURAL, THAT
WHILE SHE MAKES NO SACRIFICE FOR THE COMFORT OF THE HUSBAND, TO WHOM SHE
OWES EVERY THING, WHILE SHE EXERCISES INCESSANT CAPRICE TOWARDS HIM,
SHE SHOULD FREQUENTLY BE GOVERNED BY THE NEPHEW, TO WHOM SHE OWES
NOTHING AT ALL."

"MY DEAREST EMMA, DO NOT PRETEND, WITH YOUR SWEET TEMPER, TO UNDERSTAND
A BAD ONE, OR TO LAY DOWN RULES FOR IT: YOU MUST LET IT GO ITS OWN WAY.
I HAVE NO DOUBT OF HIS HAVING, AT TIMES, CONSIDERABLE INFLUENCE; BUT IT
MAY BE PERFECTLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO KNOW BEFOREHAND WHEN IT WILL
BE."

EMMA LISTENED, AND THEN COOLLY SAID, "I SHALL NOT BE SATISFIED, UNLESS
HE COMES."

"HE MAY HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF INFLUENCE ON SOME POINTS," CONTINUED MRS.
WESTON, "AND ON OTHERS, VERY LITTLE: AND AMONG THOSE, ON WHICH SHE IS
BEYOND HIS REACH, IT IS BUT TOO LIKELY, MAY BE THIS VERY CIRCUMSTANCE OF
HIS COMING AWAY FROM THEM TO VISIT US."



CHAPTER XV


MR. WOODHOUSE WAS SOON READY FOR HIS TEA; AND WHEN HE HAD DRANK HIS
TEA HE WAS QUITE READY TO GO HOME; AND IT WAS AS MUCH AS HIS THREE
COMPANIONS COULD DO, TO ENTERTAIN AWAY HIS NOTICE OF THE LATENESS OF
THE HOUR, BEFORE THE OTHER GENTLEMEN APPEARED. MR. WESTON WAS CHATTY AND
CONVIVIAL, AND NO FRIEND TO EARLY SEPARATIONS OF ANY SORT; BUT AT LAST
THE DRAWING-ROOM PARTY DID RECEIVE AN AUGMENTATION. MR. ELTON, IN VERY
GOOD SPIRITS, WAS ONE OF THE FIRST TO WALK IN. MRS. WESTON AND EMMA
WERE SITTING TOGETHER ON A SOFA. HE JOINED THEM IMMEDIATELY, AND, WITH
SCARCELY AN INVITATION, SEATED HIMSELF BETWEEN THEM.

EMMA, IN GOOD SPIRITS TOO, FROM THE AMUSEMENT AFFORDED HER MIND BY
THE EXPECTATION OF MR. FRANK CHURCHILL, WAS WILLING TO FORGET HIS LATE
IMPROPRIETIES, AND BE AS WELL SATISFIED WITH HIM AS BEFORE, AND ON HIS
MAKING HARRIET HIS VERY FIRST SUBJECT, WAS READY TO LISTEN WITH MOST
FRIENDLY SMILES.

HE PROFESSED HIMSELF EXTREMELY ANXIOUS ABOUT HER FAIR FRIEND--HER FAIR,
LOVELY, AMIABLE FRIEND. "DID SHE KNOW?--HAD SHE HEARD ANY THING ABOUT
HER, SINCE THEIR BEING AT RANDALLS?--HE FELT MUCH ANXIETY--HE MUST
CONFESS THAT THE NATURE OF HER COMPLAINT ALARMED HIM CONSIDERABLY."
AND IN THIS STYLE HE TALKED ON FOR SOME TIME VERY PROPERLY, NOT MUCH
ATTENDING TO ANY ANSWER, BUT ALTOGETHER SUFFICIENTLY AWAKE TO THE TERROR
OF A BAD SORE THROAT; AND EMMA WAS QUITE IN CHARITY WITH HIM.

BUT AT LAST THERE SEEMED A PERVERSE TURN; IT SEEMED ALL AT ONCE AS IF HE
WERE MORE AFRAID OF ITS BEING A BAD SORE THROAT ON HER ACCOUNT, THAN ON
HARRIET'S--MORE ANXIOUS THAT SHE SHOULD ESCAPE THE INFECTION, THAN
THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO INFECTION IN THE COMPLAINT. HE BEGAN WITH GREAT
EARNESTNESS TO ENTREAT HER TO REFRAIN FROM VISITING THE SICK-CHAMBER
AGAIN, FOR THE PRESENT--TO ENTREAT HER TO PROMISE HIM NOT TO VENTURE
INTO SUCH HAZARD TILL HE HAD SEEN MR. PERRY AND LEARNT HIS OPINION; AND
THOUGH SHE TRIED TO LAUGH IT OFF AND BRING THE SUBJECT BACK INTO ITS
PROPER COURSE, THERE WAS NO PUTTING AN END TO HIS EXTREME SOLICITUDE
ABOUT HER. SHE WAS VEXED. IT DID APPEAR--THERE WAS NO CONCEALING
IT--EXACTLY LIKE THE PRETENCE OF BEING IN LOVE WITH HER, INSTEAD OF
HARRIET; AN INCONSTANCY, IF REAL, THE MOST CONTEMPTIBLE AND ABOMINABLE!
AND SHE HAD DIFFICULTY IN BEHAVING WITH TEMPER. HE TURNED TO MRS. WESTON
TO IMPLORE HER ASSISTANCE, "WOULD NOT SHE GIVE HIM HER SUPPORT?--WOULD
NOT SHE ADD HER PERSUASIONS TO HIS, TO INDUCE MISS WOODHOUSE NOT TO GO
TO MRS. GODDARD'S TILL IT WERE CERTAIN THAT MISS SMITH'S DISORDER HAD
NO INFECTION? HE COULD NOT BE SATISFIED WITHOUT A PROMISE--WOULD NOT SHE
GIVE HIM HER INFLUENCE IN PROCURING IT?"

"SO SCRUPULOUS FOR OTHERS," HE CONTINUED, "AND YET SO CARELESS FOR
HERSELF! SHE WANTED ME TO NURSE MY COLD BY STAYING AT HOME TO-DAY, AND
YET WILL NOT PROMISE TO AVOID THE DANGER OF CATCHING AN ULCERATED SORE
THROAT HERSELF. IS THIS FAIR, MRS. WESTON?--JUDGE BETWEEN US. HAVE NOT I
SOME RIGHT TO COMPLAIN? I AM SURE OF YOUR KIND SUPPORT AND AID."

EMMA SAW MRS. WESTON'S SURPRIZE, AND FELT THAT IT MUST BE GREAT, AT AN
ADDRESS WHICH, IN WORDS AND MANNER, WAS ASSUMING TO HIMSELF THE RIGHT OF
FIRST INTEREST IN HER; AND AS FOR HERSELF, SHE WAS TOO MUCH PROVOKED AND
OFFENDED TO HAVE THE POWER OF DIRECTLY SAYING ANY THING TO THE PURPOSE.
SHE COULD ONLY GIVE HIM A LOOK; BUT IT WAS SUCH A LOOK AS SHE THOUGHT
MUST RESTORE HIM TO HIS SENSES, AND THEN LEFT THE SOFA, REMOVING TO A
SEAT BY HER SISTER, AND GIVING HER ALL HER ATTENTION.

SHE HAD NOT TIME TO KNOW HOW MR. ELTON TOOK THE REPROOF, SO RAPIDLY DID
ANOTHER SUBJECT SUCCEED; FOR MR. JOHN KNIGHTLEY NOW CAME INTO THE ROOM
FROM EXAMINING THE WEATHER, AND OPENED ON THEM ALL WITH THE INFORMATION
OF THE GROUND BEING COVERED WITH SNOW, AND OF ITS STILL SNOWING
FAST, WITH A STRONG DRIFTING WIND; CONCLUDING WITH THESE WORDS TO MR.
WOODHOUSE:

"THIS WILL PROVE A SPIRITED BEGINNING OF YOUR WINTER ENGAGEMENTS,
SIR. SOMETHING NEW FOR YOUR COACHMAN AND HORSES TO BE MAKING THEIR WAY
THROUGH A STORM OF SNOW."

POOR MR. WOODHOUSE WAS SILENT FROM CONSTERNATION; BUT EVERY BODY ELSE
HAD SOMETHING TO SAY; EVERY BODY WAS EITHER SURPRIZED OR NOT SURPRIZED,
AND HAD SOME QUESTION TO ASK, OR SOME COMFORT TO OFFER. MRS. WESTON
AND EMMA TRIED EARNESTLY TO CHEER HIM AND TURN HIS ATTENTION FROM HIS
SON-IN-LAW, WHO WAS PURSUING HIS TRIUMPH RATHER UNFEELINGLY.

"I ADMIRED YOUR RESOLUTION VERY MUCH, SIR," SAID HE, "IN VENTURING OUT
IN SUCH WEATHER, FOR OF COURSE YOU SAW THERE WOULD BE SNOW VERY SOON.
EVERY BODY MUST HAVE SEEN THE SNOW COMING ON. I ADMIRED YOUR SPIRIT; AND
I DARE SAY WE SHALL GET HOME VERY WELL. ANOTHER HOUR OR TWO'S SNOW CAN
HARDLY MAKE THE ROAD IMPASSABLE; AND WE ARE TWO CARRIAGES; IF ONE IS
BLOWN OVER IN THE BLEAK PART OF THE COMMON FIELD THERE WILL BE THE OTHER
AT HAND. I DARE SAY WE SHALL BE ALL SAFE AT HARTFIELD BEFORE MIDNIGHT."

MR. WESTON, WITH TRIUMPH OF A DIFFERENT SORT, WAS CONFESSING THAT HE
HAD KNOWN IT TO BE SNOWING SOME TIME, BUT HAD NOT SAID A WORD, LEST
IT SHOULD MAKE MR. WOODHOUSE UNCOMFORTABLE, AND BE AN EXCUSE FOR HIS
HURRYING AWAY. AS TO THERE BEING ANY QUANTITY OF SNOW FALLEN OR LIKELY
TO FALL TO IMPEDE THEIR RETURN, THAT WAS A MERE JOKE; HE WAS AFRAID THEY
WOULD FIND NO DIFFICULTY. HE WISHED THE ROAD MIGHT BE IMPASSABLE, THAT
HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO KEEP THEM ALL AT RANDALLS; AND WITH THE UTMOST
GOOD-WILL WAS SURE THAT ACCOMMODATION MIGHT BE FOUND FOR EVERY BODY,
CALLING ON HIS WIFE TO AGREE WITH HIM, THAT WITH A LITTLE CONTRIVANCE,
EVERY BODY MIGHT BE LODGED, WHICH SHE HARDLY KNEW HOW TO DO, FROM THE
CONSCIOUSNESS OF THERE BEING BUT TWO SPARE ROOMS IN THE HOUSE.

"WHAT IS TO BE DONE, MY DEAR EMMA?--WHAT IS TO BE DONE?" WAS MR.
WOODHOUSE'S FIRST EXCLAMATION, AND ALL THAT HE COULD SAY FOR SOME
TIME. TO HER HE LOOKED FOR COMFORT; AND HER ASSURANCES OF SAFETY, HER
REPRESENTATION OF THE EXCELLENCE OF THE HORSES, AND OF JAMES, AND OF
THEIR HAVING SO MANY FRIENDS ABOUT THEM, REVIVED HIM A LITTLE.

HIS ELDEST DAUGHTER'S ALARM WAS EQUAL TO HIS OWN. THE HORROR OF BEING
BLOCKED UP AT RANDALLS, WHILE HER CHILDREN WERE AT HARTFIELD, WAS FULL
IN HER IMAGINATION; AND FANCYING THE ROAD TO BE NOW JUST PASSABLE FOR
ADVENTUROUS PEOPLE, BUT IN A STATE THAT ADMITTED NO DELAY, SHE WAS EAGER
TO HAVE IT SETTLED, THAT HER FATHER AND EMMA SHOULD REMAIN AT RANDALLS,
WHILE SHE AND HER HUSBAND SET FORWARD INSTANTLY THROUGH ALL THE POSSIBLE
ACCUMULATIONS OF DRIFTED SNOW THAT MIGHT IMPEDE THEM.

"YOU HAD BETTER ORDER THE CARRIAGE DIRECTLY, MY LOVE," SAID SHE; "I DARE
SAY WE SHALL BE ABLE TO GET ALONG, IF WE SET OFF DIRECTLY; AND IF WE
DO COME TO ANY THING VERY BAD, I CAN GET OUT AND WALK. I AM NOT AT ALL
AFRAID. I SHOULD NOT MIND WALKING HALF THE WAY. I COULD CHANGE MY SHOES,
YOU KNOW, THE MOMENT I GOT HOME; AND IT IS NOT THE SORT OF THING THAT
GIVES ME COLD."

"INDEED!" REPLIED HE. "THEN, MY DEAR ISABELLA, IT IS THE MOST
EXTRAORDINARY SORT OF THING IN THE WORLD, FOR IN GENERAL EVERY THING
DOES GIVE YOU COLD. WALK HOME!--YOU ARE PRETTILY SHOD FOR WALKING HOME,
I DARE SAY. IT WILL BE BAD ENOUGH FOR THE HORSES."

ISABELLA TURNED TO MRS. WESTON FOR HER APPROBATION OF THE PLAN. MRS.
WESTON COULD ONLY APPROVE. ISABELLA THEN WENT TO EMMA; BUT EMMA COULD
NOT SO ENTIRELY GIVE UP THE HOPE OF THEIR BEING ALL ABLE TO GET AWAY;
AND THEY WERE STILL DISCUSSING THE POINT, WHEN MR. KNIGHTLEY, WHO HAD
LEFT THE ROOM IMMEDIATELY AFTER HIS BROTHER'S FIRST REPORT OF THE SNOW,
CAME BACK AGAIN, AND TOLD THEM THAT HE HAD BEEN OUT OF DOORS TO EXAMINE,
AND COULD ANSWER FOR THERE NOT BEING THE SMALLEST DIFFICULTY IN THEIR
GETTING HOME, WHENEVER THEY LIKED IT, EITHER NOW OR AN HOUR HENCE. HE
HAD GONE BEYOND THE SWEEP--SOME WAY ALONG THE HIGHBURY ROAD--THE SNOW
WAS NOWHERE ABOVE HALF AN INCH DEEP--IN MANY PLACES HARDLY ENOUGH TO
WHITEN THE GROUND; A VERY FEW FLAKES WERE FALLING AT PRESENT, BUT THE
CLOUDS WERE PARTING, AND THERE WAS EVERY APPEARANCE OF ITS BEING SOON
OVER. HE HAD SEEN THE COACHMEN, AND THEY BOTH AGREED WITH HIM IN THERE
BEING NOTHING TO APPREHEND.

TO ISABELLA, THE RELIEF OF SUCH TIDINGS WAS VERY GREAT, AND THEY WERE
SCARCELY LESS ACCEPTABLE TO EMMA ON HER FATHER'S ACCOUNT, WHO
WAS IMMEDIATELY SET AS MUCH AT EASE ON THE SUBJECT AS HIS NERVOUS
CONSTITUTION ALLOWED; BUT THE ALARM THAT HAD BEEN RAISED COULD NOT BE
APPEASED SO AS TO ADMIT OF ANY COMFORT FOR HIM WHILE HE CONTINUED AT
RANDALLS. HE WAS SATISFIED OF THERE BEING NO PRESENT DANGER IN RETURNING
HOME, BUT NO ASSURANCES COULD CONVINCE HIM THAT IT WAS SAFE TO STAY; AND
WHILE THE OTHERS WERE VARIOUSLY URGING AND RECOMMENDING, MR. KNIGHTLEY
AND EMMA SETTLED IT IN A FEW BRIEF SENTENCES: THUS--

"YOUR FATHER WILL NOT BE EASY; WHY DO NOT YOU GO?"

"I AM READY, IF THE OTHERS ARE."

"SHALL I RING THE BELL?"

"YES, DO."

AND THE BELL WAS RUNG, AND THE CARRIAGES SPOKEN FOR. A FEW MINUTES MORE,
AND EMMA HOPED TO SEE ONE TROUBLESOME COMPANION DEPOSITED IN HIS OWN
HOUSE, TO GET SOBER AND COOL, AND THE OTHER RECOVER HIS TEMPER AND
HAPPINESS WHEN THIS VISIT OF HARDSHIP WERE OVER.

THE CARRIAGE CAME: AND MR. WOODHOUSE, ALWAYS THE FIRST OBJECT ON SUCH
OCCASIONS, WAS CAREFULLY ATTENDED TO HIS OWN BY MR. KNIGHTLEY AND MR.
WESTON; BUT NOT ALL THAT EITHER COULD SAY COULD PREVENT SOME RENEWAL
OF ALARM AT THE SIGHT OF THE SNOW WHICH HAD ACTUALLY FALLEN, AND THE
DISCOVERY OF A MUCH DARKER NIGHT THAN HE HAD BEEN PREPARED FOR. "HE WAS
AFRAID THEY SHOULD HAVE A VERY BAD DRIVE. HE WAS AFRAID POOR ISABELLA
WOULD NOT LIKE IT. AND THERE WOULD BE POOR EMMA IN THE CARRIAGE BEHIND.
HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT THEY HAD BEST DO. THEY MUST KEEP AS MUCH TOGETHER
AS THEY COULD;" AND JAMES WAS TALKED TO, AND GIVEN A CHARGE TO GO VERY
SLOW AND WAIT FOR THE OTHER CARRIAGE.

ISABELLA STEPT IN AFTER HER FATHER; JOHN KNIGHTLEY, FORGETTING THAT HE
DID NOT BELONG TO THEIR PARTY, STEPT IN AFTER HIS WIFE VERY NATURALLY;
SO THAT EMMA FOUND, ON BEING ESCORTED AND FOLLOWED INTO THE SECOND
CARRIAGE BY MR. ELTON, THAT THE DOOR WAS TO BE LAWFULLY SHUT ON THEM,
AND THAT THEY WERE TO HAVE A TETE-A-TETE DRIVE. IT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN
THE AWKWARDNESS OF A MOMENT, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN RATHER A PLEASURE,
PREVIOUS TO THE SUSPICIONS OF THIS VERY DAY; SHE COULD HAVE TALKED TO
HIM OF HARRIET, AND THE THREE-QUARTERS OF A MILE WOULD HAVE SEEMED BUT
ONE. BUT NOW, SHE WOULD RATHER IT HAD NOT HAPPENED. SHE BELIEVED HE HAD
BEEN DRINKING TOO MUCH OF MR. WESTON'S GOOD WINE, AND FELT SURE THAT HE
WOULD WANT TO BE TALKING NONSENSE.

TO RESTRAIN HIM AS MUCH AS MIGHT BE, BY HER OWN MANNERS, SHE WAS
IMMEDIATELY PREPARING TO SPEAK WITH EXQUISITE CALMNESS AND GRAVITY OF
THE WEATHER AND THE NIGHT; BUT SCARCELY HAD SHE BEGUN, SCARCELY HAD THEY
PASSED THE SWEEP-GATE AND JOINED THE OTHER CARRIAGE, THAN SHE FOUND HER
SUBJECT CUT UP--HER HAND SEIZED--HER ATTENTION DEMANDED, AND MR. ELTON
ACTUALLY MAKING VIOLENT LOVE TO HER: AVAILING HIMSELF OF THE PRECIOUS
OPPORTUNITY, DECLARING SENTIMENTS WHICH MUST BE ALREADY WELL KNOWN,
HOPING--FEARING--ADORING--READY TO DIE IF SHE REFUSED HIM; BUT
FLATTERING HIMSELF THAT HIS ARDENT ATTACHMENT AND UNEQUALLED LOVE AND
UNEXAMPLED PASSION COULD NOT FAIL OF HAVING SOME EFFECT, AND IN SHORT,
VERY MUCH RESOLVED ON BEING SERIOUSLY ACCEPTED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. IT
REALLY WAS SO. WITHOUT SCRUPLE--WITHOUT APOLOGY--WITHOUT MUCH APPARENT
DIFFIDENCE, MR. ELTON, THE LOVER OF HARRIET, WAS PROFESSING HIMSELF
HER LOVER. SHE TRIED TO STOP HIM; BUT VAINLY; HE WOULD GO ON, AND SAY
IT ALL. ANGRY AS SHE WAS, THE THOUGHT OF THE MOMENT MADE HER RESOLVE TO
RESTRAIN HERSELF WHEN SHE DID SPEAK. SHE FELT THAT HALF THIS FOLLY MUST
BE DRUNKENNESS, AND THEREFORE COULD HOPE THAT IT MIGHT BELONG ONLY TO
THE PASSING HOUR. ACCORDINGLY, WITH A MIXTURE OF THE SERIOUS AND THE
PLAYFUL, WHICH SHE HOPED WOULD BEST SUIT HIS HALF AND HALF STATE, SHE
REPLIED,

"I AM VERY MUCH ASTONISHED, MR. ELTON. THIS TO ME! YOU FORGET
YOURSELF--YOU TAKE ME FOR MY FRIEND--ANY MESSAGE TO MISS SMITH I SHALL
BE HAPPY TO DELIVER; BUT NO MORE OF THIS TO ME, IF YOU PLEASE."

"MISS SMITH!--MESSAGE TO MISS SMITH!--WHAT COULD SHE POSSIBLY
MEAN!"--AND HE REPEATED HER WORDS WITH SUCH ASSURANCE OF ACCENT, SUCH
BOASTFUL PRETENCE OF AMAZEMENT, THAT SHE COULD NOT HELP REPLYING WITH
QUICKNESS,

"MR. ELTON, THIS IS THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY CONDUCT! AND I CAN ACCOUNT
FOR IT ONLY IN ONE WAY; YOU ARE NOT YOURSELF, OR YOU COULD NOT SPEAK
EITHER TO ME, OR OF HARRIET, IN SUCH A MANNER. COMMAND YOURSELF ENOUGH
TO SAY NO MORE, AND I WILL ENDEAVOUR TO FORGET IT."

BUT MR. ELTON HAD ONLY DRUNK WINE ENOUGH TO ELEVATE HIS SPIRITS, NOT AT
ALL TO CONFUSE HIS INTELLECTS. HE PERFECTLY KNEW HIS OWN MEANING; AND
HAVING WARMLY PROTESTED AGAINST HER SUSPICION AS MOST INJURIOUS, AND
SLIGHTLY TOUCHED UPON HIS RESPECT FOR MISS SMITH AS HER FRIEND,--BUT
ACKNOWLEDGING HIS WONDER THAT MISS SMITH SHOULD BE MENTIONED AT ALL,--HE
RESUMED THE SUBJECT OF HIS OWN PASSION, AND WAS VERY URGENT FOR A
FAVOURABLE ANSWER.

AS SHE THOUGHT LESS OF HIS INEBRIETY, SHE THOUGHT MORE OF HIS
INCONSTANCY AND PRESUMPTION; AND WITH FEWER STRUGGLES FOR POLITENESS,
REPLIED,

"IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO DOUBT ANY LONGER. YOU HAVE MADE YOURSELF
TOO CLEAR. MR. ELTON, MY ASTONISHMENT IS MUCH BEYOND ANY THING I CAN
EXPRESS. AFTER SUCH BEHAVIOUR, AS I HAVE WITNESSED DURING THE LAST
MONTH, TO MISS SMITH--SUCH ATTENTIONS AS I HAVE BEEN IN THE DAILY
HABIT OF OBSERVING--TO BE ADDRESSING ME IN THIS MANNER--THIS IS AN
UNSTEADINESS OF CHARACTER, INDEED, WHICH I HAD NOT SUPPOSED POSSIBLE!
BELIEVE ME, SIR, I AM FAR, VERY FAR, FROM GRATIFIED IN BEING THE OBJECT
OF SUCH PROFESSIONS."

"GOOD HEAVEN!" CRIED MR. ELTON, "WHAT CAN BE THE MEANING OF THIS?--MISS
SMITH!--I NEVER THOUGHT OF MISS SMITH IN THE WHOLE COURSE OF MY
EXISTENCE--NEVER PAID HER ANY ATTENTIONS, BUT AS YOUR FRIEND: NEVER
CARED WHETHER SHE WERE DEAD OR ALIVE, BUT AS YOUR FRIEND. IF SHE
HAS FANCIED OTHERWISE, HER OWN WISHES HAVE MISLED HER, AND I AM VERY
SORRY--EXTREMELY SORRY--BUT, MISS SMITH, INDEED!--OH! MISS WOODHOUSE!
WHO CAN THINK OF MISS SMITH, WHEN MISS WOODHOUSE IS NEAR! NO, UPON MY
HONOUR, THERE IS NO UNSTEADINESS OF CHARACTER. I HAVE THOUGHT ONLY OF
YOU. I PROTEST AGAINST HAVING PAID THE SMALLEST ATTENTION TO ANY ONE
ELSE. EVERY THING THAT I HAVE SAID OR DONE, FOR MANY WEEKS PAST, HAS
BEEN WITH THE SOLE VIEW OF MARKING MY ADORATION OF YOURSELF. YOU
CANNOT REALLY, SERIOUSLY, DOUBT IT. NO!--(IN AN ACCENT MEANT TO BE
INSINUATING)--I AM SURE YOU HAVE SEEN AND UNDERSTOOD ME."

IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY WHAT EMMA FELT, ON HEARING THIS--WHICH
OF ALL HER UNPLEASANT SENSATIONS WAS UPPERMOST. SHE WAS TOO COMPLETELY
OVERPOWERED TO BE IMMEDIATELY ABLE TO REPLY: AND TWO MOMENTS OF SILENCE
BEING AMPLE ENCOURAGEMENT FOR MR. ELTON'S SANGUINE STATE OF MIND, HE
TRIED TO TAKE HER HAND AGAIN, AS HE JOYOUSLY EXCLAIMED--

"CHARMING MISS WOODHOUSE! ALLOW ME TO INTERPRET THIS INTERESTING
SILENCE. IT CONFESSES THAT YOU HAVE LONG UNDERSTOOD ME."

"NO, SIR," CRIED EMMA, "IT CONFESSES NO SUCH THING. SO FAR FROM HAVING
LONG UNDERSTOOD YOU, I HAVE BEEN IN A MOST COMPLETE ERROR WITH RESPECT
TO YOUR VIEWS, TILL THIS MOMENT. AS TO MYSELF, I AM VERY SORRY THAT YOU
SHOULD HAVE BEEN GIVING WAY TO ANY FEELINGS--NOTHING COULD BE FARTHER
FROM MY WISHES--YOUR ATTACHMENT TO MY FRIEND HARRIET--YOUR PURSUIT OF
HER, (PURSUIT, IT APPEARED,) GAVE ME GREAT PLEASURE, AND I HAVE BEEN
VERY EARNESTLY WISHING YOU SUCCESS: BUT HAD I SUPPOSED THAT SHE WERE NOT
YOUR ATTRACTION TO HARTFIELD, I SHOULD CERTAINLY HAVE THOUGHT YOU JUDGED
ILL IN MAKING YOUR VISITS SO FREQUENT. AM I TO BELIEVE THAT YOU HAVE
NEVER SOUGHT TO RECOMMEND YOURSELF PARTICULARLY TO MISS SMITH?--THAT YOU
HAVE NEVER THOUGHT SERIOUSLY OF HER?"

"NEVER, MADAM," CRIED HE, AFFRONTED IN HIS TURN: "NEVER, I ASSURE YOU.
I THINK SERIOUSLY OF MISS SMITH!--MISS SMITH IS A VERY GOOD SORT OF
GIRL; AND I SHOULD BE HAPPY TO SEE HER RESPECTABLY SETTLED. I WISH
HER EXTREMELY WELL: AND, NO DOUBT, THERE ARE MEN WHO MIGHT NOT OBJECT
TO--EVERY BODY HAS THEIR LEVEL: BUT AS FOR MYSELF, I AM NOT, I THINK,
QUITE SO MUCH AT A LOSS. I NEED NOT SO TOTALLY DESPAIR OF AN EQUAL
ALLIANCE, AS TO BE ADDRESSING MYSELF TO MISS SMITH!--NO, MADAM, MY
VISITS TO HARTFIELD HAVE BEEN FOR YOURSELF ONLY; AND THE ENCOURAGEMENT I
RECEIVED--"

"ENCOURAGEMENT!--I GIVE YOU ENCOURAGEMENT!--SIR, YOU HAVE BEEN ENTIRELY
MISTAKEN IN SUPPOSING IT. I HAVE SEEN YOU ONLY AS THE ADMIRER OF MY
FRIEND. IN NO OTHER LIGHT COULD YOU HAVE BEEN MORE TO ME THAN A COMMON
ACQUAINTANCE. I AM EXCEEDINGLY SORRY: BUT IT IS WELL THAT THE MISTAKE
ENDS WHERE IT DOES. HAD THE SAME BEHAVIOUR CONTINUED, MISS SMITH MIGHT
HAVE BEEN LED INTO A MISCONCEPTION OF YOUR VIEWS; NOT BEING AWARE,
PROBABLY, ANY MORE THAN MYSELF, OF THE VERY GREAT INEQUALITY WHICH YOU
ARE SO SENSIBLE OF. BUT, AS IT IS, THE DISAPPOINTMENT IS SINGLE, AND, I
TRUST, WILL NOT BE LASTING. I HAVE NO THOUGHTS OF MATRIMONY AT PRESENT."

HE WAS TOO ANGRY TO SAY ANOTHER WORD; HER MANNER TOO DECIDED TO INVITE
SUPPLICATION; AND IN THIS STATE OF SWELLING RESENTMENT, AND MUTUALLY
DEEP MORTIFICATION, THEY HAD TO CONTINUE TOGETHER A FEW MINUTES LONGER,
FOR THE FEARS OF MR. WOODHOUSE HAD CONFINED THEM TO A FOOT-PACE. IF
THERE HAD NOT BEEN SO MUCH ANGER, THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN DESPERATE
AWKWARDNESS; BUT THEIR STRAIGHTFORWARD EMOTIONS LEFT NO ROOM FOR THE
LITTLE ZIGZAGS OF EMBARRASSMENT. WITHOUT KNOWING WHEN THE CARRIAGE
TURNED INTO VICARAGE LANE, OR WHEN IT STOPPED, THEY FOUND THEMSELVES,
ALL AT ONCE, AT THE DOOR OF HIS HOUSE; AND HE WAS OUT BEFORE ANOTHER
SYLLABLE PASSED.--EMMA THEN FELT IT INDISPENSABLE TO WISH HIM A GOOD
NIGHT. THE COMPLIMENT WAS JUST RETURNED, COLDLY AND PROUDLY; AND, UNDER
INDESCRIBABLE IRRITATION OF SPIRITS, SHE WAS THEN CONVEYED TO HARTFIELD.

THERE SHE WAS WELCOMED, WITH THE UTMOST DELIGHT, BY HER FATHER, WHO
HAD BEEN TREMBLING FOR THE DANGERS OF A SOLITARY DRIVE FROM VICARAGE
LANE--TURNING A CORNER WHICH HE COULD NEVER BEAR TO THINK OF--AND IN
STRANGE HANDS--A MERE COMMON COACHMAN--NO JAMES; AND THERE IT SEEMED AS
IF HER RETURN ONLY WERE WANTED TO MAKE EVERY THING GO WELL: FOR MR.
JOHN KNIGHTLEY, ASHAMED OF HIS ILL-HUMOUR, WAS NOW ALL KINDNESS AND
ATTENTION; AND SO PARTICULARLY SOLICITOUS FOR THE COMFORT OF HER
FATHER, AS TO SEEM--IF NOT QUITE READY TO JOIN HIM IN A BASIN OF
GRUEL--PERFECTLY SENSIBLE OF ITS BEING EXCEEDINGLY WHOLESOME; AND THE
DAY WAS CONCLUDING IN PEACE AND COMFORT TO ALL THEIR LITTLE PARTY,
EXCEPT HERSELF.--BUT HER MIND HAD NEVER BEEN IN SUCH PERTURBATION; AND
IT NEEDED A VERY STRONG EFFORT TO APPEAR ATTENTIVE AND CHEERFUL TILL THE
USUAL HOUR OF SEPARATING ALLOWED HER THE RELIEF OF QUIET REFLECTION.



CHAPTER XVI


THE HAIR WAS CURLED, AND THE MAID SENT AWAY, AND EMMA SAT DOWN TO THINK
AND BE MISERABLE.--IT WAS A WRETCHED BUSINESS INDEED!--SUCH AN OVERTHROW
OF EVERY THING SHE HAD BEEN WISHING FOR!--SUCH A DEVELOPMENT OF EVERY
THING MOST UNWELCOME!--SUCH A BLOW FOR HARRIET!--THAT WAS THE WORST
OF ALL. EVERY PART OF IT BROUGHT PAIN AND HUMILIATION, OF SOME SORT OR
OTHER; BUT, COMPARED WITH THE EVIL TO HARRIET, ALL WAS LIGHT; AND
SHE WOULD GLADLY HAVE SUBMITTED TO FEEL YET MORE MISTAKEN--MORE IN
ERROR--MORE DISGRACED BY MIS-JUDGMENT, THAN SHE ACTUALLY WAS, COULD THE
EFFECTS OF HER BLUNDERS HAVE BEEN CONFINED TO HERSELF.

"IF I HAD NOT PERSUADED HARRIET INTO LIKING THE MAN, I COULD HAVE
BORNE ANY THING. HE MIGHT HAVE DOUBLED HIS PRESUMPTION TO ME--BUT POOR
HARRIET!"

HOW SHE COULD HAVE BEEN SO DECEIVED!--HE PROTESTED THAT HE HAD NEVER
THOUGHT SERIOUSLY OF HARRIET--NEVER! SHE LOOKED BACK AS WELL AS
SHE COULD; BUT IT WAS ALL CONFUSION. SHE HAD TAKEN UP THE IDEA, SHE
SUPPOSED, AND MADE EVERY THING BEND TO IT. HIS MANNERS, HOWEVER, MUST
HAVE BEEN UNMARKED, WAVERING, DUBIOUS, OR SHE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN SO
MISLED.

THE PICTURE!--HOW EAGER HE HAD BEEN ABOUT THE PICTURE!--AND THE
CHARADE!--AND AN HUNDRED OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES;--HOW CLEARLY THEY HAD
SEEMED TO POINT AT HARRIET. TO BE SURE, THE CHARADE, WITH ITS "READY
WIT"--BUT THEN THE "SOFT EYES"--IN FACT IT SUITED NEITHER; IT WAS
A JUMBLE WITHOUT TASTE OR TRUTH. WHO COULD HAVE SEEN THROUGH SUCH
THICK-HEADED NONSENSE?

CERTAINLY SHE HAD OFTEN, ESPECIALLY OF LATE, THOUGHT HIS MANNERS TO
HERSELF UNNECESSARILY GALLANT; BUT IT HAD PASSED AS HIS WAY, AS A MERE
ERROR OF JUDGMENT, OF KNOWLEDGE, OF TASTE, AS ONE PROOF AMONG OTHERS
THAT HE HAD NOT ALWAYS LIVED IN THE BEST SOCIETY, THAT WITH ALL THE
GENTLENESS OF HIS ADDRESS, TRUE ELEGANCE WAS SOMETIMES WANTING; BUT,
TILL THIS VERY DAY, SHE HAD NEVER, FOR AN INSTANT, SUSPECTED IT TO MEAN
ANY THING BUT GRATEFUL RESPECT TO HER AS HARRIET'S FRIEND.

TO MR. JOHN KNIGHTLEY WAS SHE INDEBTED FOR HER FIRST IDEA ON THE
SUBJECT, FOR THE FIRST START OF ITS POSSIBILITY. THERE WAS NO DENYING
THAT THOSE BROTHERS HAD PENETRATION. SHE REMEMBERED WHAT MR. KNIGHTLEY
HAD ONCE SAID TO HER ABOUT MR. ELTON, THE CAUTION HE HAD GIVEN,
THE CONVICTION HE HAD PROFESSED THAT MR. ELTON WOULD NEVER MARRY
INDISCREETLY; AND BLUSHED TO THINK HOW MUCH TRUER A KNOWLEDGE OF HIS
CHARACTER HAD BEEN THERE SHEWN THAN ANY SHE HAD REACHED HERSELF. IT
WAS DREADFULLY MORTIFYING; BUT MR. ELTON WAS PROVING HIMSELF, IN MANY
RESPECTS, THE VERY REVERSE OF WHAT SHE HAD MEANT AND BELIEVED HIM;
PROUD, ASSUMING, CONCEITED; VERY FULL OF HIS OWN CLAIMS, AND LITTLE
CONCERNED ABOUT THE FEELINGS OF OTHERS.

CONTRARY TO THE USUAL COURSE OF THINGS, MR. ELTON'S WANTING TO PAY HIS
ADDRESSES TO HER HAD SUNK HIM IN HER OPINION. HIS PROFESSIONS AND HIS
PROPOSALS DID HIM NO SERVICE. SHE THOUGHT NOTHING OF HIS ATTACHMENT,
AND WAS INSULTED BY HIS HOPES. HE WANTED TO MARRY WELL, AND HAVING THE
ARROGANCE TO RAISE HIS EYES TO HER, PRETENDED TO BE IN LOVE; BUT SHE WAS
PERFECTLY EASY AS TO HIS NOT SUFFERING ANY DISAPPOINTMENT THAT NEED BE
CARED FOR. THERE HAD BEEN NO REAL AFFECTION EITHER IN HIS LANGUAGE OR
MANNERS. SIGHS AND FINE WORDS HAD BEEN GIVEN IN ABUNDANCE; BUT SHE COULD
HARDLY DEVISE ANY SET OF EXPRESSIONS, OR FANCY ANY TONE OF VOICE, LESS
ALLIED WITH REAL LOVE. SHE NEED NOT TROUBLE HERSELF TO PITY HIM. HE
ONLY WANTED TO AGGRANDISE AND ENRICH HIMSELF; AND IF MISS WOODHOUSE
OF HARTFIELD, THE HEIRESS OF THIRTY THOUSAND POUNDS, WERE NOT QUITE SO
EASILY OBTAINED AS HE HAD FANCIED, HE WOULD SOON TRY FOR MISS SOMEBODY
ELSE WITH TWENTY, OR WITH TEN.

BUT--THAT HE SHOULD TALK OF ENCOURAGEMENT, SHOULD CONSIDER HER AS AWARE
OF HIS VIEWS, ACCEPTING HIS ATTENTIONS, MEANING (IN SHORT), TO MARRY
HIM!--SHOULD SUPPOSE HIMSELF HER EQUAL IN CONNEXION OR MIND!--LOOK DOWN
UPON HER FRIEND, SO WELL UNDERSTANDING THE GRADATIONS OF RANK BELOW
HIM, AND BE SO BLIND TO WHAT ROSE ABOVE, AS TO FANCY HIMSELF SHEWING NO
PRESUMPTION IN ADDRESSING HER!--IT WAS MOST PROVOKING.

PERHAPS IT WAS NOT FAIR TO EXPECT HIM TO FEEL HOW VERY MUCH HE WAS HER
INFERIOR IN TALENT, AND ALL THE ELEGANCIES OF MIND. THE VERY WANT OF
SUCH EQUALITY MIGHT PREVENT HIS PERCEPTION OF IT; BUT HE MUST KNOW THAT
IN FORTUNE AND CONSEQUENCE SHE WAS GREATLY HIS SUPERIOR. HE MUST
KNOW THAT THE WOODHOUSES HAD BEEN SETTLED FOR SEVERAL GENERATIONS AT
HARTFIELD, THE YOUNGER BRANCH OF A VERY ANCIENT FAMILY--AND THAT THE
ELTONS WERE NOBODY. THE LANDED PROPERTY OF HARTFIELD CERTAINLY WAS
INCONSIDERABLE, BEING BUT A SORT OF NOTCH IN THE DONWELL ABBEY ESTATE,
TO WHICH ALL THE REST OF HIGHBURY BELONGED; BUT THEIR FORTUNE, FROM
OTHER SOURCES, WAS SUCH AS TO MAKE THEM SCARCELY SECONDARY TO DONWELL
ABBEY ITSELF, IN EVERY OTHER KIND OF CONSEQUENCE; AND THE WOODHOUSES HAD
LONG HELD A HIGH PLACE IN THE CONSIDERATION OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD WHICH
MR. ELTON HAD FIRST ENTERED NOT TWO YEARS AGO, TO MAKE HIS WAY AS HE
COULD, WITHOUT ANY ALLIANCES BUT IN TRADE, OR ANY THING TO RECOMMEND HIM
TO NOTICE BUT HIS SITUATION AND HIS CIVILITY.--BUT HE HAD FANCIED HER
IN LOVE WITH HIM; THAT EVIDENTLY MUST HAVE BEEN HIS DEPENDENCE; AND
AFTER RAVING A LITTLE ABOUT THE SEEMING INCONGRUITY OF GENTLE MANNERS
AND A CONCEITED HEAD, EMMA WAS OBLIGED IN COMMON HONESTY TO STOP
AND ADMIT THAT HER OWN BEHAVIOUR TO HIM HAD BEEN SO COMPLAISANT AND
OBLIGING, SO FULL OF COURTESY AND ATTENTION, AS (SUPPOSING HER REAL
MOTIVE UNPERCEIVED) MIGHT WARRANT A MAN OF ORDINARY OBSERVATION AND
DELICACY, LIKE MR. ELTON, IN FANCYING HIMSELF A VERY DECIDED FAVOURITE.
IF SHE HAD SO MISINTERPRETED HIS FEELINGS, SHE HAD LITTLE RIGHT TO
WONDER THAT HE, WITH SELF-INTEREST TO BLIND HIM, SHOULD HAVE MISTAKEN
HERS.

THE FIRST ERROR AND THE WORST LAY AT HER DOOR. IT WAS FOOLISH, IT WAS
WRONG, TO TAKE SO ACTIVE A PART IN BRINGING ANY TWO PEOPLE TOGETHER. IT
WAS ADVENTURING TOO FAR, ASSUMING TOO MUCH, MAKING LIGHT OF WHAT
OUGHT TO BE SERIOUS, A TRICK OF WHAT OUGHT TO BE SIMPLE. SHE WAS QUITE
CONCERNED AND ASHAMED, AND RESOLVED TO DO SUCH THINGS NO MORE.

"HERE HAVE I," SAID SHE, "ACTUALLY TALKED POOR HARRIET INTO BEING VERY
MUCH ATTACHED TO THIS MAN. SHE MIGHT NEVER HAVE THOUGHT OF HIM BUT FOR
ME; AND CERTAINLY NEVER WOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF HIM WITH HOPE, IF I HAD
NOT ASSURED HER OF HIS ATTACHMENT, FOR SHE IS AS MODEST AND HUMBLE AS I
USED TO THINK HIM. OH! THAT I HAD BEEN SATISFIED WITH PERSUADING HER NOT
TO ACCEPT YOUNG MARTIN. THERE I WAS QUITE RIGHT. THAT WAS WELL DONE
OF ME; BUT THERE I SHOULD HAVE STOPPED, AND LEFT THE REST TO TIME AND
CHANCE. I WAS INTRODUCING HER INTO GOOD COMPANY, AND GIVING HER THE
OPPORTUNITY OF PLEASING SOME ONE WORTH HAVING; I OUGHT NOT TO HAVE
ATTEMPTED MORE. BUT NOW, POOR GIRL, HER PEACE IS CUT UP FOR SOME TIME.
I HAVE BEEN BUT HALF A FRIEND TO HER; AND IF SHE WERE NOT TO FEEL THIS
DISAPPOINTMENT SO VERY MUCH, I AM SURE I HAVE NOT AN IDEA OF ANY BODY
ELSE WHO WOULD BE AT ALL DESIRABLE FOR HER;--WILLIAM COXE--OH! NO, I
COULD NOT ENDURE WILLIAM COXE--A PERT YOUNG LAWYER."

SHE STOPT TO BLUSH AND LAUGH AT HER OWN RELAPSE, AND THEN RESUMED A MORE
SERIOUS, MORE DISPIRITING COGITATION UPON WHAT HAD BEEN, AND MIGHT BE,
AND MUST BE. THE DISTRESSING EXPLANATION SHE HAD TO MAKE TO HARRIET, AND
ALL THAT POOR HARRIET WOULD BE SUFFERING, WITH THE AWKWARDNESS OF
FUTURE MEETINGS, THE DIFFICULTIES OF CONTINUING OR DISCONTINUING THE
ACQUAINTANCE, OF SUBDUING FEELINGS, CONCEALING RESENTMENT, AND AVOIDING
ECLAT, WERE ENOUGH TO OCCUPY HER IN MOST UNMIRTHFUL REFLECTIONS SOME
TIME LONGER, AND SHE WENT TO BED AT LAST WITH NOTHING SETTLED BUT THE
CONVICTION OF HER HAVING BLUNDERED MOST DREADFULLY.

TO YOUTH AND NATURAL CHEERFULNESS LIKE EMMA'S, THOUGH UNDER TEMPORARY
GLOOM AT NIGHT, THE RETURN OF DAY WILL HARDLY FAIL TO BRING RETURN OF
SPIRITS. THE YOUTH AND CHEERFULNESS OF MORNING ARE IN HAPPY ANALOGY,
AND OF POWERFUL OPERATION; AND IF THE DISTRESS BE NOT POIGNANT ENOUGH
TO KEEP THE EYES UNCLOSED, THEY WILL BE SURE TO OPEN TO SENSATIONS OF
SOFTENED PAIN AND BRIGHTER HOPE.

EMMA GOT UP ON THE MORROW MORE DISPOSED FOR COMFORT THAN SHE HAD GONE
TO BED, MORE READY TO SEE ALLEVIATIONS OF THE EVIL BEFORE HER, AND TO
DEPEND ON GETTING TOLERABLY OUT OF IT.

IT WAS A GREAT CONSOLATION THAT MR. ELTON SHOULD NOT BE REALLY IN
LOVE WITH HER, OR SO PARTICULARLY AMIABLE AS TO MAKE IT SHOCKING TO
DISAPPOINT HIM--THAT HARRIET'S NATURE SHOULD NOT BE OF THAT SUPERIOR
SORT IN WHICH THE FEELINGS ARE MOST ACUTE AND RETENTIVE--AND THAT THERE
COULD BE NO NECESSITY FOR ANY BODY'S KNOWING WHAT HAD PASSED EXCEPT THE
THREE PRINCIPALS, AND ESPECIALLY FOR HER FATHER'S BEING GIVEN A MOMENT'S
UNEASINESS ABOUT IT.

THESE WERE VERY CHEERING THOUGHTS; AND THE SIGHT OF A GREAT DEAL OF SNOW
ON THE GROUND DID HER FURTHER SERVICE, FOR ANY THING WAS WELCOME THAT
MIGHT JUSTIFY THEIR ALL THREE BEING QUITE ASUNDER AT PRESENT.

THE WEATHER WAS MOST FAVOURABLE FOR HER; THOUGH CHRISTMAS DAY, SHE
COULD NOT GO TO CHURCH. MR. WOODHOUSE WOULD HAVE BEEN MISERABLE HAD HIS
DAUGHTER ATTEMPTED IT, AND SHE WAS THEREFORE SAFE FROM EITHER EXCITING
OR RECEIVING UNPLEASANT AND MOST UNSUITABLE IDEAS. THE GROUND COVERED
WITH SNOW, AND THE ATMOSPHERE IN THAT UNSETTLED STATE BETWEEN FROST AND
THAW, WHICH IS OF ALL OTHERS THE MOST UNFRIENDLY FOR EXERCISE, EVERY
MORNING BEGINNING IN RAIN OR SNOW, AND EVERY EVENING SETTING IN TO
FREEZE, SHE WAS FOR MANY DAYS A MOST HONOURABLE PRISONER. NO INTERCOURSE
WITH HARRIET POSSIBLE BUT BY NOTE; NO CHURCH FOR HER ON SUNDAY ANY
MORE THAN ON CHRISTMAS DAY; AND NO NEED TO FIND EXCUSES FOR MR. ELTON'S
ABSENTING HIMSELF.

IT WAS WEATHER WHICH MIGHT FAIRLY CONFINE EVERY BODY AT HOME; AND THOUGH
SHE HOPED AND BELIEVED HIM TO BE REALLY TAKING COMFORT IN SOME SOCIETY
OR OTHER, IT WAS VERY PLEASANT TO HAVE HER FATHER SO WELL SATISFIED WITH
HIS BEING ALL ALONE IN HIS OWN HOUSE, TOO WISE TO STIR OUT; AND TO
HEAR HIM SAY TO MR. KNIGHTLEY, WHOM NO WEATHER COULD KEEP ENTIRELY FROM
THEM,--

"AH! MR. KNIGHTLEY, WHY DO NOT YOU STAY AT HOME LIKE POOR MR. ELTON?"

THESE DAYS OF CONFINEMENT WOULD HAVE BEEN, BUT FOR HER PRIVATE
PERPLEXITIES, REMARKABLY COMFORTABLE, AS SUCH SECLUSION EXACTLY SUITED
HER BROTHER, WHOSE FEELINGS MUST ALWAYS BE OF GREAT IMPORTANCE TO
HIS COMPANIONS; AND HE HAD, BESIDES, SO THOROUGHLY CLEARED OFF HIS
ILL-HUMOUR AT RANDALLS, THAT HIS AMIABLENESS NEVER FAILED HIM DURING THE
REST OF HIS STAY AT HARTFIELD. HE WAS ALWAYS AGREEABLE AND OBLIGING,
AND SPEAKING PLEASANTLY OF EVERY BODY. BUT WITH ALL THE HOPES OF
CHEERFULNESS, AND ALL THE PRESENT COMFORT OF DELAY, THERE WAS STILL SUCH
AN EVIL HANGING OVER HER IN THE HOUR OF EXPLANATION WITH HARRIET, AS
MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR EMMA TO BE EVER PERFECTLY AT EASE.



CHAPTER XVII


MR. AND MRS. JOHN KNIGHTLEY WERE NOT DETAINED LONG AT HARTFIELD. THE
WEATHER SOON IMPROVED ENOUGH FOR THOSE TO MOVE WHO MUST MOVE; AND MR.
WOODHOUSE HAVING, AS USUAL, TRIED TO PERSUADE HIS DAUGHTER TO STAY
BEHIND WITH ALL HER CHILDREN, WAS OBLIGED TO SEE THE WHOLE PARTY
SET OFF, AND RETURN TO HIS LAMENTATIONS OVER THE DESTINY OF POOR
ISABELLA;--WHICH POOR ISABELLA, PASSING HER LIFE WITH THOSE SHE DOATED
ON, FULL OF THEIR MERITS, BLIND TO THEIR FAULTS, AND ALWAYS INNOCENTLY
BUSY, MIGHT HAVE BEEN A MODEL OF RIGHT FEMININE HAPPINESS.

THE EVENING OF THE VERY DAY ON WHICH THEY WENT BROUGHT A NOTE FROM MR.
ELTON TO MR. WOODHOUSE, A LONG, CIVIL, CEREMONIOUS NOTE, TO SAY, WITH
MR. ELTON'S BEST COMPLIMENTS, "THAT HE WAS PROPOSING TO LEAVE HIGHBURY
THE FOLLOWING MORNING IN HIS WAY TO BATH; WHERE, IN COMPLIANCE WITH
THE PRESSING ENTREATIES OF SOME FRIENDS, HE HAD ENGAGED TO SPEND A FEW
WEEKS, AND VERY MUCH REGRETTED THE IMPOSSIBILITY HE WAS UNDER, FROM
VARIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES OF WEATHER AND BUSINESS, OF TAKING A PERSONAL
LEAVE OF MR. WOODHOUSE, OF WHOSE FRIENDLY CIVILITIES HE SHOULD EVER
RETAIN A GRATEFUL SENSE--AND HAD MR. WOODHOUSE ANY COMMANDS, SHOULD BE
HAPPY TO ATTEND TO THEM."

EMMA WAS MOST AGREEABLY SURPRIZED.--MR. ELTON'S ABSENCE JUST AT THIS
TIME WAS THE VERY THING TO BE DESIRED. SHE ADMIRED HIM FOR CONTRIVING
IT, THOUGH NOT ABLE TO GIVE HIM MUCH CREDIT FOR THE MANNER IN WHICH IT
WAS ANNOUNCED. RESENTMENT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE PLAINLY SPOKEN THAN
IN A CIVILITY TO HER FATHER, FROM WHICH SHE WAS SO POINTEDLY EXCLUDED.
SHE HAD NOT EVEN A SHARE IN HIS OPENING COMPLIMENTS.--HER NAME WAS NOT
MENTIONED;--AND THERE WAS SO STRIKING A CHANGE IN ALL THIS, AND SUCH AN
ILL-JUDGED SOLEMNITY OF LEAVE-TAKING IN HIS GRACEFUL ACKNOWLEDGMENTS, AS
SHE THOUGHT, AT FIRST, COULD NOT ESCAPE HER FATHER'S SUSPICION.

IT DID, HOWEVER.--HER FATHER WAS QUITE TAKEN UP WITH THE SURPRIZE OF SO
SUDDEN A JOURNEY, AND HIS FEARS THAT MR. ELTON MIGHT NEVER GET SAFELY TO
THE END OF IT, AND SAW NOTHING EXTRAORDINARY IN HIS LANGUAGE. IT WAS A
VERY USEFUL NOTE, FOR IT SUPPLIED THEM WITH FRESH MATTER FOR THOUGHT
AND CONVERSATION DURING THE REST OF THEIR LONELY EVENING. MR. WOODHOUSE
TALKED OVER HIS ALARMS, AND EMMA WAS IN SPIRITS TO PERSUADE THEM AWAY
WITH ALL HER USUAL PROMPTITUDE.

SHE NOW RESOLVED TO KEEP HARRIET NO LONGER IN THE DARK. SHE HAD REASON
TO BELIEVE HER NEARLY RECOVERED FROM HER COLD, AND IT WAS DESIRABLE THAT
SHE SHOULD HAVE AS MUCH TIME AS POSSIBLE FOR GETTING THE BETTER OF
HER OTHER COMPLAINT BEFORE THE GENTLEMAN'S RETURN. SHE WENT TO MRS.
GODDARD'S ACCORDINGLY THE VERY NEXT DAY, TO UNDERGO THE NECESSARY
PENANCE OF COMMUNICATION; AND A SEVERE ONE IT WAS.--SHE HAD TO DESTROY
ALL THE HOPES WHICH SHE HAD BEEN SO INDUSTRIOUSLY FEEDING--TO APPEAR IN
THE UNGRACIOUS CHARACTER OF THE ONE PREFERRED--AND ACKNOWLEDGE HERSELF
GROSSLY MISTAKEN AND MIS-JUDGING IN ALL HER IDEAS ON ONE SUBJECT, ALL
HER OBSERVATIONS, ALL HER CONVICTIONS, ALL HER PROPHECIES FOR THE LAST
SIX WEEKS.

THE CONFESSION COMPLETELY RENEWED HER FIRST SHAME--AND THE SIGHT OF
HARRIET'S TEARS MADE HER THINK THAT SHE SHOULD NEVER BE IN CHARITY WITH
HERSELF AGAIN.

HARRIET BORE THE INTELLIGENCE VERY WELL--BLAMING NOBODY--AND IN EVERY
THING TESTIFYING SUCH AN INGENUOUSNESS OF DISPOSITION AND LOWLY OPINION
OF HERSELF, AS MUST APPEAR WITH PARTICULAR ADVANTAGE AT THAT MOMENT TO
HER FRIEND.

EMMA WAS IN THE HUMOUR TO VALUE SIMPLICITY AND MODESTY TO THE UTMOST;
AND ALL THAT WAS AMIABLE, ALL THAT OUGHT TO BE ATTACHING, SEEMED ON
HARRIET'S SIDE, NOT HER OWN. HARRIET DID NOT CONSIDER HERSELF AS HAVING
ANY THING TO COMPLAIN OF. THE AFFECTION OF SUCH A MAN AS MR. ELTON
WOULD HAVE BEEN TOO GREAT A DISTINCTION.--SHE NEVER COULD HAVE DESERVED
HIM--AND NOBODY BUT SO PARTIAL AND KIND A FRIEND AS MISS WOODHOUSE WOULD
HAVE THOUGHT IT POSSIBLE.

HER TEARS FELL ABUNDANTLY--BUT HER GRIEF WAS SO TRULY ARTLESS, THAT
NO DIGNITY COULD HAVE MADE IT MORE RESPECTABLE IN EMMA'S EYES--AND
SHE LISTENED TO HER AND TRIED TO CONSOLE HER WITH ALL HER HEART AND
UNDERSTANDING--REALLY FOR THE TIME CONVINCED THAT HARRIET WAS THE
SUPERIOR CREATURE OF THE TWO--AND THAT TO RESEMBLE HER WOULD BE MORE FOR
HER OWN WELFARE AND HAPPINESS THAN ALL THAT GENIUS OR INTELLIGENCE COULD
DO.

IT WAS RATHER TOO LATE IN THE DAY TO SET ABOUT BEING SIMPLE-MINDED AND
IGNORANT; BUT SHE LEFT HER WITH EVERY PREVIOUS RESOLUTION CONFIRMED OF
BEING HUMBLE AND DISCREET, AND REPRESSING IMAGINATION ALL THE REST OF
HER LIFE. HER SECOND DUTY NOW, INFERIOR ONLY TO HER FATHER'S CLAIMS, WAS
TO PROMOTE HARRIET'S COMFORT, AND ENDEAVOUR TO PROVE HER OWN AFFECTION
IN SOME BETTER METHOD THAN BY MATCH-MAKING. SHE GOT HER TO HARTFIELD,
AND SHEWED HER THE MOST UNVARYING KINDNESS, STRIVING TO OCCUPY AND
AMUSE HER, AND BY BOOKS AND CONVERSATION, TO DRIVE MR. ELTON FROM HER
THOUGHTS.

TIME, SHE KNEW, MUST BE ALLOWED FOR THIS BEING THOROUGHLY DONE; AND
SHE COULD SUPPOSE HERSELF BUT AN INDIFFERENT JUDGE OF SUCH MATTERS IN
GENERAL, AND VERY INADEQUATE TO SYMPATHISE IN AN ATTACHMENT TO MR. ELTON
IN PARTICULAR; BUT IT SEEMED TO HER REASONABLE THAT AT HARRIET'S AGE,
AND WITH THE ENTIRE EXTINCTION OF ALL HOPE, SUCH A PROGRESS MIGHT BE
MADE TOWARDS A STATE OF COMPOSURE BY THE TIME OF MR. ELTON'S RETURN, AS
TO ALLOW THEM ALL TO MEET AGAIN IN THE COMMON ROUTINE OF ACQUAINTANCE,
WITHOUT ANY DANGER OF BETRAYING SENTIMENTS OR INCREASING THEM.

HARRIET DID THINK HIM ALL PERFECTION, AND MAINTAINED THE NON-EXISTENCE
OF ANY BODY EQUAL TO HIM IN PERSON OR GOODNESS--AND DID, IN TRUTH,
PROVE HERSELF MORE RESOLUTELY IN LOVE THAN EMMA HAD FORESEEN; BUT YET
IT APPEARED TO HER SO NATURAL, SO INEVITABLE TO STRIVE AGAINST AN
INCLINATION OF THAT SORT UNREQUITED, THAT SHE COULD NOT COMPREHEND ITS
CONTINUING VERY LONG IN EQUAL FORCE.

IF MR. ELTON, ON HIS RETURN, MADE HIS OWN INDIFFERENCE AS EVIDENT AND
INDUBITABLE AS SHE COULD NOT DOUBT HE WOULD ANXIOUSLY DO, SHE COULD NOT
IMAGINE HARRIET'S PERSISTING TO PLACE HER HAPPINESS IN THE SIGHT OR THE
RECOLLECTION OF HIM.

THEIR BEING FIXED, SO ABSOLUTELY FIXED, IN THE SAME PLACE, WAS BAD FOR
EACH, FOR ALL THREE. NOT ONE OF THEM HAD THE POWER OF REMOVAL, OR OF
EFFECTING ANY MATERIAL CHANGE OF SOCIETY. THEY MUST ENCOUNTER EACH
OTHER, AND MAKE THE BEST OF IT.

HARRIET WAS FARTHER UNFORTUNATE IN THE TONE OF HER COMPANIONS AT MRS.
GODDARD'S; MR. ELTON BEING THE ADORATION OF ALL THE TEACHERS AND GREAT
GIRLS IN THE SCHOOL; AND IT MUST BE AT HARTFIELD ONLY THAT SHE COULD
HAVE ANY CHANCE OF HEARING HIM SPOKEN OF WITH COOLING MODERATION OR
REPELLENT TRUTH. WHERE THE WOUND HAD BEEN GIVEN, THERE MUST THE CURE BE
FOUND IF ANYWHERE; AND EMMA FELT THAT, TILL SHE SAW HER IN THE WAY OF
CURE, THERE COULD BE NO TRUE PEACE FOR HERSELF.



CHAPTER XVIII


MR. FRANK CHURCHILL DID NOT COME. WHEN THE TIME PROPOSED DREW NEAR, MRS.
WESTON'S FEARS WERE JUSTIFIED IN THE ARRIVAL OF A LETTER OF EXCUSE. FOR
THE PRESENT, HE COULD NOT BE SPARED, TO HIS "VERY GREAT MORTIFICATION
AND REGRET; BUT STILL HE LOOKED FORWARD WITH THE HOPE OF COMING TO
RANDALLS AT NO DISTANT PERIOD."

MRS. WESTON WAS EXCEEDINGLY DISAPPOINTED--MUCH MORE DISAPPOINTED, IN
FACT, THAN HER HUSBAND, THOUGH HER DEPENDENCE ON SEEING THE YOUNG MAN
HAD BEEN SO MUCH MORE SOBER: BUT A SANGUINE TEMPER, THOUGH FOR EVER
EXPECTING MORE GOOD THAN OCCURS, DOES NOT ALWAYS PAY FOR ITS HOPES BY
ANY PROPORTIONATE DEPRESSION. IT SOON FLIES OVER THE PRESENT FAILURE,
AND BEGINS TO HOPE AGAIN. FOR HALF AN HOUR MR. WESTON WAS SURPRIZED AND
SORRY; BUT THEN HE BEGAN TO PERCEIVE THAT FRANK'S COMING TWO OR THREE
MONTHS LATER WOULD BE A MUCH BETTER PLAN; BETTER TIME OF YEAR;
BETTER WEATHER; AND THAT HE WOULD BE ABLE, WITHOUT ANY DOUBT, TO STAY
CONSIDERABLY LONGER WITH THEM THAN IF HE HAD COME SOONER.

THESE FEELINGS RAPIDLY RESTORED HIS COMFORT, WHILE MRS. WESTON, OF
A MORE APPREHENSIVE DISPOSITION, FORESAW NOTHING BUT A REPETITION OF
EXCUSES AND DELAYS; AND AFTER ALL HER CONCERN FOR WHAT HER HUSBAND WAS
TO SUFFER, SUFFERED A GREAT DEAL MORE HERSELF.

EMMA WAS NOT AT THIS TIME IN A STATE OF SPIRITS TO CARE REALLY ABOUT MR.
FRANK CHURCHILL'S NOT COMING, EXCEPT AS A DISAPPOINTMENT AT RANDALLS.
THE ACQUAINTANCE AT PRESENT HAD NO CHARM FOR HER. SHE WANTED, RATHER, TO
BE QUIET, AND OUT OF TEMPTATION; BUT STILL, AS IT WAS DESIRABLE THAT SHE
SHOULD APPEAR, IN GENERAL, LIKE HER USUAL SELF, SHE TOOK CARE TO EXPRESS
AS MUCH INTEREST IN THE CIRCUMSTANCE, AND ENTER AS WARMLY INTO MR.
AND MRS. WESTON'S DISAPPOINTMENT, AS MIGHT NATURALLY BELONG TO THEIR
FRIENDSHIP.

SHE WAS THE FIRST TO ANNOUNCE IT TO MR. KNIGHTLEY; AND EXCLAIMED QUITE
AS MUCH AS WAS NECESSARY, (OR, BEING ACTING A PART, PERHAPS RATHER
MORE,) AT THE CONDUCT OF THE CHURCHILLS, IN KEEPING HIM AWAY. SHE THEN
PROCEEDED TO SAY A GOOD DEAL MORE THAN SHE FELT, OF THE ADVANTAGE OF
SUCH AN ADDITION TO THEIR CONFINED SOCIETY IN SURRY; THE PLEASURE OF
LOOKING AT SOMEBODY NEW; THE GALA-DAY TO HIGHBURY ENTIRE, WHICH THE
SIGHT OF HIM WOULD HAVE MADE; AND ENDING WITH REFLECTIONS ON THE
CHURCHILLS AGAIN, FOUND HERSELF DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN A DISAGREEMENT
WITH MR. KNIGHTLEY; AND, TO HER GREAT AMUSEMENT, PERCEIVED THAT SHE WAS
TAKING THE OTHER SIDE OF THE QUESTION FROM HER REAL OPINION, AND MAKING
USE OF MRS. WESTON'S ARGUMENTS AGAINST HERSELF.

"THE CHURCHILLS ARE VERY LIKELY IN FAULT," SAID MR. KNIGHTLEY, COOLLY;
"BUT I DARE SAY HE MIGHT COME IF HE WOULD."

"I DO NOT KNOW WHY YOU SHOULD SAY SO. HE WISHES EXCEEDINGLY TO COME; BUT
HIS UNCLE AND AUNT WILL NOT SPARE HIM."

"I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT HE HAS NOT THE POWER OF COMING, IF HE MADE A
POINT OF IT. IT IS TOO UNLIKELY, FOR ME TO BELIEVE IT WITHOUT PROOF."

"HOW ODD YOU ARE! WHAT HAS MR. FRANK CHURCHILL DONE, TO MAKE YOU SUPPOSE
HIM SUCH AN UNNATURAL CREATURE?"

"I AM NOT SUPPOSING HIM AT ALL AN UNNATURAL CREATURE, IN SUSPECTING THAT
HE MAY HAVE LEARNT TO BE ABOVE HIS CONNEXIONS, AND TO CARE VERY LITTLE
FOR ANY THING BUT HIS OWN PLEASURE, FROM LIVING WITH THOSE WHO HAVE
ALWAYS SET HIM THE EXAMPLE OF IT. IT IS A GREAT DEAL MORE NATURAL THAN
ONE COULD WISH, THAT A YOUNG MAN, BROUGHT UP BY THOSE WHO ARE PROUD,
LUXURIOUS, AND SELFISH, SHOULD BE PROUD, LUXURIOUS, AND SELFISH TOO. IF
FRANK CHURCHILL HAD WANTED TO SEE HIS FATHER, HE WOULD HAVE CONTRIVED IT
BETWEEN SEPTEMBER AND JANUARY. A MAN AT HIS AGE--WHAT IS HE?--THREE OR
FOUR-AND-TWENTY--CANNOT BE WITHOUT THE MEANS OF DOING AS MUCH AS THAT.
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE."

"THAT'S EASILY SAID, AND EASILY FELT BY YOU, WHO HAVE ALWAYS BEEN YOUR
OWN MASTER. YOU ARE THE WORST JUDGE IN THE WORLD, MR. KNIGHTLEY, OF THE
DIFFICULTIES OF DEPENDENCE. YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT IT IS TO HAVE TEMPERS
TO MANAGE."

"IT IS NOT TO BE CONCEIVED THAT A MAN OF THREE OR FOUR-AND-TWENTY
SHOULD NOT HAVE LIBERTY OF MIND OR LIMB TO THAT AMOUNT. HE CANNOT WANT
MONEY--HE CANNOT WANT LEISURE. WE KNOW, ON THE CONTRARY, THAT HE HAS SO
MUCH OF BOTH, THAT HE IS GLAD TO GET RID OF THEM AT THE IDLEST HAUNTS IN
THE KINGDOM. WE HEAR OF HIM FOR EVER AT SOME WATERING-PLACE OR OTHER. A
LITTLE WHILE AGO, HE WAS AT WEYMOUTH. THIS PROVES THAT HE CAN LEAVE THE
CHURCHILLS."

"YES, SOMETIMES HE CAN."

"AND THOSE TIMES ARE WHENEVER HE THINKS IT WORTH HIS WHILE; WHENEVER
THERE IS ANY TEMPTATION OF PLEASURE."

"IT IS VERY UNFAIR TO JUDGE OF ANY BODY'S CONDUCT, WITHOUT AN INTIMATE
KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR SITUATION. NOBODY, WHO HAS NOT BEEN IN THE INTERIOR
OF A FAMILY, CAN SAY WHAT THE DIFFICULTIES OF ANY INDIVIDUAL OF THAT
FAMILY MAY BE. WE OUGHT TO BE ACQUAINTED WITH ENSCOMBE, AND WITH MRS.
CHURCHILL'S TEMPER, BEFORE WE PRETEND TO DECIDE UPON WHAT HER NEPHEW
CAN DO. HE MAY, AT TIMES, BE ABLE TO DO A GREAT DEAL MORE THAN HE CAN AT
OTHERS."

"THERE IS ONE THING, EMMA, WHICH A MAN CAN ALWAYS DO, IF HE CHUSES, AND
THAT IS, HIS DUTY; NOT BY MANOEUVRING AND FINESSING, BUT BY VIGOUR AND
RESOLUTION. IT IS FRANK CHURCHILL'S DUTY TO PAY THIS ATTENTION TO HIS
FATHER. HE KNOWS IT TO BE SO, BY HIS PROMISES AND MESSAGES; BUT IF HE
WISHED TO DO IT, IT MIGHT BE DONE. A MAN WHO FELT RIGHTLY WOULD SAY AT
ONCE, SIMPLY AND RESOLUTELY, TO MRS. CHURCHILL--'EVERY SACRIFICE OF
MERE PLEASURE YOU WILL ALWAYS FIND ME READY TO MAKE TO YOUR CONVENIENCE;
BUT I MUST GO AND SEE MY FATHER IMMEDIATELY. I KNOW HE WOULD BE HURT BY
MY FAILING IN SUCH A MARK OF RESPECT TO HIM ON THE PRESENT OCCASION.
I SHALL, THEREFORE, SET OFF TO-MORROW.'--IF HE WOULD SAY SO TO HER
AT ONCE, IN THE TONE OF DECISION BECOMING A MAN, THERE WOULD BE NO
OPPOSITION MADE TO HIS GOING."

"NO," SAID EMMA, LAUGHING; "BUT PERHAPS THERE MIGHT BE SOME MADE TO HIS
COMING BACK AGAIN. SUCH LANGUAGE FOR A YOUNG MAN ENTIRELY DEPENDENT, TO
USE!--NOBODY BUT YOU, MR. KNIGHTLEY, WOULD IMAGINE IT POSSIBLE. BUT YOU
HAVE NOT AN IDEA OF WHAT IS REQUISITE IN SITUATIONS DIRECTLY OPPOSITE TO
YOUR OWN. MR. FRANK CHURCHILL TO BE MAKING SUCH A SPEECH AS THAT TO
THE UNCLE AND AUNT, WHO HAVE BROUGHT HIM UP, AND ARE TO PROVIDE FOR
HIM!--STANDING UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM, I SUPPOSE, AND SPEAKING AS
LOUD AS HE COULD!--HOW CAN YOU IMAGINE SUCH CONDUCT PRACTICABLE?"

"DEPEND UPON IT, EMMA, A SENSIBLE MAN WOULD FIND NO DIFFICULTY IN IT. HE
WOULD FEEL HIMSELF IN THE RIGHT; AND THE DECLARATION--MADE, OF COURSE,
AS A MAN OF SENSE WOULD MAKE IT, IN A PROPER MANNER--WOULD DO HIM MORE
GOOD, RAISE HIM HIGHER, FIX HIS INTEREST STRONGER WITH THE PEOPLE HE
DEPENDED ON, THAN ALL THAT A LINE OF SHIFTS AND EXPEDIENTS CAN EVER DO.
RESPECT WOULD BE ADDED TO AFFECTION. THEY WOULD FEEL THAT THEY COULD
TRUST HIM; THAT THE NEPHEW WHO HAD DONE RIGHTLY BY HIS FATHER, WOULD DO
RIGHTLY BY THEM; FOR THEY KNOW, AS WELL AS HE DOES, AS WELL AS ALL THE
WORLD MUST KNOW, THAT HE OUGHT TO PAY THIS VISIT TO HIS FATHER; AND
WHILE MEANLY EXERTING THEIR POWER TO DELAY IT, ARE IN THEIR HEARTS NOT
THINKING THE BETTER OF HIM FOR SUBMITTING TO THEIR WHIMS. RESPECT FOR
RIGHT CONDUCT IS FELT BY EVERY BODY. IF HE WOULD ACT IN THIS SORT OF
MANNER, ON PRINCIPLE, CONSISTENTLY, REGULARLY, THEIR LITTLE MINDS WOULD
BEND TO HIS."

"I RATHER DOUBT THAT. YOU ARE VERY FOND OF BENDING LITTLE MINDS; BUT
WHERE LITTLE MINDS BELONG TO RICH PEOPLE IN AUTHORITY, I THINK THEY HAVE
A KNACK OF SWELLING OUT, TILL THEY ARE QUITE AS UNMANAGEABLE AS GREAT
ONES. I CAN IMAGINE, THAT IF YOU, AS YOU ARE, MR. KNIGHTLEY, WERE TO BE
TRANSPORTED AND PLACED ALL AT ONCE IN MR. FRANK CHURCHILL'S SITUATION,
YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO SAY AND DO JUST WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN RECOMMENDING FOR
HIM; AND IT MIGHT HAVE A VERY GOOD EFFECT. THE CHURCHILLS MIGHT NOT HAVE
A WORD TO SAY IN RETURN; BUT THEN, YOU WOULD HAVE NO HABITS OF EARLY
OBEDIENCE AND LONG OBSERVANCE TO BREAK THROUGH. TO HIM WHO HAS, IT MIGHT
NOT BE SO EASY TO BURST FORTH AT ONCE INTO PERFECT INDEPENDENCE, AND SET
ALL THEIR CLAIMS ON HIS GRATITUDE AND REGARD AT NOUGHT. HE MAY HAVE AS
STRONG A SENSE OF WHAT WOULD BE RIGHT, AS YOU CAN HAVE, WITHOUT BEING SO
EQUAL, UNDER PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES, TO ACT UP TO IT."

"THEN IT WOULD NOT BE SO STRONG A SENSE. IF IT FAILED TO PRODUCE EQUAL
EXERTION, IT COULD NOT BE AN EQUAL CONVICTION."

"OH, THE DIFFERENCE OF SITUATION AND HABIT! I WISH YOU WOULD TRY TO
UNDERSTAND WHAT AN AMIABLE YOUNG MAN MAY BE LIKELY TO FEEL IN DIRECTLY
OPPOSING THOSE, WHOM AS CHILD AND BOY HE HAS BEEN LOOKING UP TO ALL HIS
LIFE."

"OUR AMIABLE YOUNG MAN IS A VERY WEAK YOUNG MAN, IF THIS BE THE FIRST
OCCASION OF HIS CARRYING THROUGH A RESOLUTION TO DO RIGHT AGAINST THE
WILL OF OTHERS. IT OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN A HABIT WITH HIM BY THIS TIME, OF
FOLLOWING HIS DUTY, INSTEAD OF CONSULTING EXPEDIENCY. I CAN ALLOW FOR
THE FEARS OF THE CHILD, BUT NOT OF THE MAN. AS HE BECAME RATIONAL, HE
OUGHT TO HAVE ROUSED HIMSELF AND SHAKEN OFF ALL THAT WAS UNWORTHY IN
THEIR AUTHORITY. HE OUGHT TO HAVE OPPOSED THE FIRST ATTEMPT ON THEIR
SIDE TO MAKE HIM SLIGHT HIS FATHER. HAD HE BEGUN AS HE OUGHT, THERE
WOULD HAVE BEEN NO DIFFICULTY NOW."

"WE SHALL NEVER AGREE ABOUT HIM," CRIED EMMA; "BUT THAT IS NOTHING
EXTRAORDINARY. I HAVE NOT THE LEAST IDEA OF HIS BEING A WEAK YOUNG MAN:
I FEEL SURE THAT HE IS NOT. MR. WESTON WOULD NOT BE BLIND TO FOLLY,
THOUGH IN HIS OWN SON; BUT HE IS VERY LIKELY TO HAVE A MORE YIELDING,
COMPLYING, MILD DISPOSITION THAN WOULD SUIT YOUR NOTIONS OF MAN'S
PERFECTION. I DARE SAY HE HAS; AND THOUGH IT MAY CUT HIM OFF FROM SOME
ADVANTAGES, IT WILL SECURE HIM MANY OTHERS."

"YES; ALL THE ADVANTAGES OF SITTING STILL WHEN HE OUGHT TO MOVE, AND
OF LEADING A LIFE OF MERE IDLE PLEASURE, AND FANCYING HIMSELF EXTREMELY
EXPERT IN FINDING EXCUSES FOR IT. HE CAN SIT DOWN AND WRITE A FINE
FLOURISHING LETTER, FULL OF PROFESSIONS AND FALSEHOODS, AND PERSUADE
HIMSELF THAT HE HAS HIT UPON THE VERY BEST METHOD IN THE WORLD OF
PRESERVING PEACE AT HOME AND PREVENTING HIS FATHER'S HAVING ANY RIGHT TO
COMPLAIN. HIS LETTERS DISGUST ME."

"YOUR FEELINGS ARE SINGULAR. THEY SEEM TO SATISFY EVERY BODY ELSE."

"I SUSPECT THEY DO NOT SATISFY MRS. WESTON. THEY HARDLY CAN SATISFY
A WOMAN OF HER GOOD SENSE AND QUICK FEELINGS: STANDING IN A MOTHER'S
PLACE, BUT WITHOUT A MOTHER'S AFFECTION TO BLIND HER. IT IS ON HER
ACCOUNT THAT ATTENTION TO RANDALLS IS DOUBLY DUE, AND SHE MUST DOUBLY
FEEL THE OMISSION. HAD SHE BEEN A PERSON OF CONSEQUENCE HERSELF, HE
WOULD HAVE COME I DARE SAY; AND IT WOULD NOT HAVE SIGNIFIED WHETHER
HE DID OR NO. CAN YOU THINK YOUR FRIEND BEHINDHAND IN THESE SORT OF
CONSIDERATIONS? DO YOU SUPPOSE SHE DOES NOT OFTEN SAY ALL THIS TO
HERSELF? NO, EMMA, YOUR AMIABLE YOUNG MAN CAN BE AMIABLE ONLY IN FRENCH,
NOT IN ENGLISH. HE MAY BE VERY 'AIMABLE,' HAVE VERY GOOD MANNERS, AND BE
VERY AGREEABLE; BUT HE CAN HAVE NO ENGLISH DELICACY TOWARDS THE FEELINGS
OF OTHER PEOPLE: NOTHING REALLY AMIABLE ABOUT HIM."

"YOU SEEM DETERMINED TO THINK ILL OF HIM."

"ME!--NOT AT ALL," REPLIED MR. KNIGHTLEY, RATHER DISPLEASED; "I DO NOT
WANT TO THINK ILL OF HIM. I SHOULD BE AS READY TO ACKNOWLEDGE HIS MERITS
AS ANY OTHER MAN; BUT I HEAR OF NONE, EXCEPT WHAT ARE MERELY PERSONAL;
THAT HE IS WELL-GROWN AND GOOD-LOOKING, WITH SMOOTH, PLAUSIBLE MANNERS."

"WELL, IF HE HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO RECOMMEND HIM, HE WILL BE A TREASURE
AT HIGHBURY. WE DO NOT OFTEN LOOK UPON FINE YOUNG MEN, WELL-BRED AND
AGREEABLE. WE MUST NOT BE NICE AND ASK FOR ALL THE VIRTUES INTO THE
BARGAIN. CANNOT YOU IMAGINE, MR. KNIGHTLEY, WHAT A SENSATION HIS
COMING WILL PRODUCE? THERE WILL BE BUT ONE SUBJECT THROUGHOUT THE
PARISHES OF DONWELL AND HIGHBURY; BUT ONE INTEREST--ONE OBJECT OF
CURIOSITY; IT WILL BE ALL MR. FRANK CHURCHILL; WE SHALL THINK AND SPEAK
OF NOBODY ELSE."

"YOU WILL EXCUSE MY BEING SO MUCH OVER-POWERED. IF I FIND HIM
CONVERSABLE, I SHALL BE GLAD OF HIS ACQUAINTANCE; BUT IF HE IS ONLY A
CHATTERING COXCOMB, HE WILL NOT OCCUPY MUCH OF MY TIME OR THOUGHTS."

"MY IDEA OF HIM IS, THAT HE CAN ADAPT HIS CONVERSATION TO THE TASTE OF
EVERY BODY, AND HAS THE POWER AS WELL AS THE WISH OF BEING UNIVERSALLY
AGREEABLE. TO YOU, HE WILL TALK OF FARMING; TO ME, OF DRAWING OR MUSIC;
AND SO ON TO EVERY BODY, HAVING THAT GENERAL INFORMATION ON ALL SUBJECTS
WHICH WILL ENABLE HIM TO FOLLOW THE LEAD, OR TAKE THE LEAD, JUST AS
PROPRIETY MAY REQUIRE, AND TO SPEAK EXTREMELY WELL ON EACH; THAT IS MY
IDEA OF HIM."

"AND MINE," SAID MR. KNIGHTLEY WARMLY, "IS, THAT IF HE TURN OUT ANY
THING LIKE IT, HE WILL BE THE MOST INSUFFERABLE FELLOW BREATHING! WHAT!
AT THREE-AND-TWENTY TO BE THE KING OF HIS COMPANY--THE GREAT MAN--THE
PRACTISED POLITICIAN, WHO IS TO READ EVERY BODY'S CHARACTER, AND MAKE
EVERY BODY'S TALENTS CONDUCE TO THE DISPLAY OF HIS OWN SUPERIORITY; TO
BE DISPENSING HIS FLATTERIES AROUND, THAT HE MAY MAKE ALL APPEAR LIKE
FOOLS COMPARED WITH HIMSELF! MY DEAR EMMA, YOUR OWN GOOD SENSE COULD NOT
ENDURE SUCH A PUPPY WHEN IT CAME TO THE POINT."

"I WILL SAY NO MORE ABOUT HIM," CRIED EMMA, "YOU TURN EVERY THING TO
EVIL. WE ARE BOTH PREJUDICED; YOU AGAINST, I FOR HIM; AND WE HAVE NO
CHANCE OF AGREEING TILL HE IS REALLY HERE."

"PREJUDICED! I AM NOT PREJUDICED."

"BUT I AM VERY MUCH, AND WITHOUT BEING AT ALL ASHAMED OF IT. MY LOVE FOR
MR. AND MRS. WESTON GIVES ME A DECIDED PREJUDICE IN HIS FAVOUR."

"HE IS A PERSON I NEVER THINK OF FROM ONE MONTH'S END TO ANOTHER," SAID
MR. KNIGHTLEY, WITH A DEGREE OF VEXATION, WHICH MADE EMMA IMMEDIATELY
TALK OF SOMETHING ELSE, THOUGH SHE COULD NOT COMPREHEND WHY HE SHOULD BE
ANGRY.

TO TAKE A DISLIKE TO A YOUNG MAN, ONLY BECAUSE HE APPEARED TO BE OF A
DIFFERENT DISPOSITION FROM HIMSELF, WAS UNWORTHY THE REAL LIBERALITY OF
MIND WHICH SHE WAS ALWAYS USED TO ACKNOWLEDGE IN HIM; FOR WITH ALL THE
HIGH OPINION OF HIMSELF, WHICH SHE HAD OFTEN LAID TO HIS CHARGE, SHE HAD
NEVER BEFORE FOR A MOMENT SUPPOSED IT COULD MAKE HIM UNJUST TO THE MERIT
OF ANOTHER.




VOLUME II



CHAPTER I


EMMA AND HARRIET HAD BEEN WALKING TOGETHER ONE MORNING, AND, IN EMMA'S
OPINION, HAD BEEN TALKING ENOUGH OF MR. ELTON FOR THAT DAY. SHE COULD
NOT THINK THAT HARRIET'S SOLACE OR HER OWN SINS REQUIRED MORE; AND
SHE WAS THEREFORE INDUSTRIOUSLY GETTING RID OF THE SUBJECT AS THEY
RETURNED;--BUT IT BURST OUT AGAIN WHEN SHE THOUGHT SHE HAD SUCCEEDED,
AND AFTER SPEAKING SOME TIME OF WHAT THE POOR MUST SUFFER IN WINTER, AND
RECEIVING NO OTHER ANSWER THAN A VERY PLAINTIVE--"MR. ELTON IS SO GOOD
TO THE POOR!" SHE FOUND SOMETHING ELSE MUST BE DONE.

THEY WERE JUST APPROACHING THE HOUSE WHERE LIVED MRS. AND MISS BATES.
SHE DETERMINED TO CALL UPON THEM AND SEEK SAFETY IN NUMBERS. THERE WAS
ALWAYS SUFFICIENT REASON FOR SUCH AN ATTENTION; MRS. AND MISS BATES
LOVED TO BE CALLED ON, AND SHE KNEW SHE WAS CONSIDERED BY THE VERY FEW
WHO PRESUMED EVER TO SEE IMPERFECTION IN HER, AS RATHER NEGLIGENT IN
THAT RESPECT, AND AS NOT CONTRIBUTING WHAT SHE OUGHT TO THE STOCK OF
THEIR SCANTY COMFORTS.

SHE HAD HAD MANY A HINT FROM MR. KNIGHTLEY AND SOME FROM HER OWN HEART,
AS TO HER DEFICIENCY--BUT NONE WERE EQUAL TO COUNTERACT THE PERSUASION
OF ITS BEING VERY DISAGREEABLE,--A WASTE OF TIME--TIRESOME WOMEN--AND
ALL THE HORROR OF BEING IN DANGER OF FALLING IN WITH THE SECOND-RATE AND
THIRD-RATE OF HIGHBURY, WHO WERE CALLING ON THEM FOR EVER, AND THEREFORE
SHE SELDOM WENT NEAR THEM. BUT NOW SHE MADE THE SUDDEN RESOLUTION OF NOT
PASSING THEIR DOOR WITHOUT GOING IN--OBSERVING, AS SHE PROPOSED IT TO
HARRIET, THAT, AS WELL AS SHE COULD CALCULATE, THEY WERE JUST NOW QUITE
SAFE FROM ANY LETTER FROM JANE FAIRFAX.

THE HOUSE BELONGED TO PEOPLE IN BUSINESS. MRS. AND MISS BATES OCCUPIED
THE DRAWING-ROOM FLOOR; AND THERE, IN THE VERY MODERATE-SIZED APARTMENT,
WHICH WAS EVERY THING TO THEM, THE VISITORS WERE MOST CORDIALLY AND EVEN
GRATEFULLY WELCOMED; THE QUIET NEAT OLD LADY, WHO WITH HER KNITTING WAS
SEATED IN THE WARMEST CORNER, WANTING EVEN TO GIVE UP HER PLACE TO
MISS WOODHOUSE, AND HER MORE ACTIVE, TALKING DAUGHTER, ALMOST READY
TO OVERPOWER THEM WITH CARE AND KINDNESS, THANKS FOR THEIR VISIT,
SOLICITUDE FOR THEIR SHOES, ANXIOUS INQUIRIES AFTER MR. WOODHOUSE'S
HEALTH, CHEERFUL COMMUNICATIONS ABOUT HER MOTHER'S, AND SWEET-CAKE FROM
THE BEAUFET--"MRS. COLE HAD JUST BEEN THERE, JUST CALLED IN FOR TEN
MINUTES, AND HAD BEEN SO GOOD AS TO SIT AN HOUR WITH THEM, AND SHE HAD
TAKEN A PIECE OF CAKE AND BEEN SO KIND AS TO SAY SHE LIKED IT VERY MUCH;
AND, THEREFORE, SHE HOPED MISS WOODHOUSE AND MISS SMITH WOULD DO THEM
THE FAVOUR TO EAT A PIECE TOO."

THE MENTION OF THE COLES WAS SURE TO BE FOLLOWED BY THAT OF MR. ELTON.
THERE WAS INTIMACY BETWEEN THEM, AND MR. COLE HAD HEARD FROM MR. ELTON
SINCE HIS GOING AWAY. EMMA KNEW WHAT WAS COMING; THEY MUST HAVE THE
LETTER OVER AGAIN, AND SETTLE HOW LONG HE HAD BEEN GONE, AND HOW MUCH
HE WAS ENGAGED IN COMPANY, AND WHAT A FAVOURITE HE WAS WHEREVER HE WENT,
AND HOW FULL THE MASTER OF THE CEREMONIES' BALL HAD BEEN; AND SHE WENT
THROUGH IT VERY WELL, WITH ALL THE INTEREST AND ALL THE COMMENDATION
THAT COULD BE REQUISITE, AND ALWAYS PUTTING FORWARD TO PREVENT HARRIET'S
BEING OBLIGED TO SAY A WORD.

THIS SHE HAD BEEN PREPARED FOR WHEN SHE ENTERED THE HOUSE; BUT MEANT,
HAVING ONCE TALKED HIM HANDSOMELY OVER, TO BE NO FARTHER INCOMMODED BY
ANY TROUBLESOME TOPIC, AND TO WANDER AT LARGE AMONGST ALL THE MISTRESSES
AND MISSES OF HIGHBURY, AND THEIR CARD-PARTIES. SHE HAD NOT BEEN
PREPARED TO HAVE JANE FAIRFAX SUCCEED MR. ELTON; BUT HE WAS ACTUALLY
HURRIED OFF BY MISS BATES, SHE JUMPED AWAY FROM HIM AT LAST ABRUPTLY TO
THE COLES, TO USHER IN A LETTER FROM HER NIECE.

"OH! YES--MR. ELTON, I UNDERSTAND--CERTAINLY AS TO DANCING--MRS. COLE
WAS TELLING ME THAT DANCING AT THE ROOMS AT BATH WAS--MRS. COLE WAS SO
KIND AS TO SIT SOME TIME WITH US, TALKING OF JANE; FOR AS SOON AS
SHE CAME IN, SHE BEGAN INQUIRING AFTER HER, JANE IS SO VERY GREAT A
FAVOURITE THERE. WHENEVER SHE IS WITH US, MRS. COLE DOES NOT KNOW HOW TO
SHEW HER KINDNESS ENOUGH; AND I MUST SAY THAT JANE DESERVES IT AS MUCH
AS ANY BODY CAN. AND SO SHE BEGAN INQUIRING AFTER HER DIRECTLY, SAYING,
'I KNOW YOU CANNOT HAVE HEARD FROM JANE LATELY, BECAUSE IT IS NOT HER
TIME FOR WRITING;' AND WHEN I IMMEDIATELY SAID, 'BUT INDEED WE HAVE, WE
HAD A LETTER THIS VERY MORNING,' I DO NOT KNOW THAT I EVER SAW ANY BODY
MORE SURPRIZED. 'HAVE YOU, UPON YOUR HONOUR?' SAID SHE; 'WELL, THAT IS
QUITE UNEXPECTED. DO LET ME HEAR WHAT SHE SAYS.'"

EMMA'S POLITENESS WAS AT HAND DIRECTLY, TO SAY, WITH SMILING INTEREST--

"HAVE YOU HEARD FROM MISS FAIRFAX SO LATELY? I AM EXTREMELY HAPPY. I
HOPE SHE IS WELL?"

"THANK YOU. YOU ARE SO KIND!" REPLIED THE HAPPILY DECEIVED AUNT, WHILE
EAGERLY HUNTING FOR THE LETTER.--"OH! HERE IT IS. I WAS SURE IT COULD
NOT BE FAR OFF; BUT I HAD PUT MY HUSWIFE UPON IT, YOU SEE, WITHOUT BEING
AWARE, AND SO IT WAS QUITE HID, BUT I HAD IT IN MY HAND SO VERY LATELY
THAT I WAS ALMOST SURE IT MUST BE ON THE TABLE. I WAS READING IT TO MRS.
COLE, AND SINCE SHE WENT AWAY, I WAS READING IT AGAIN TO MY MOTHER, FOR
IT IS SUCH A PLEASURE TO HER--A LETTER FROM JANE--THAT SHE CAN NEVER
HEAR IT OFTEN ENOUGH; SO I KNEW IT COULD NOT BE FAR OFF, AND HERE IT IS,
ONLY JUST UNDER MY HUSWIFE--AND SINCE YOU ARE SO KIND AS TO WISH TO HEAR
WHAT SHE SAYS;--BUT, FIRST OF ALL, I REALLY MUST, IN JUSTICE TO
JANE, APOLOGISE FOR HER WRITING SO SHORT A LETTER--ONLY TWO PAGES YOU
SEE--HARDLY TWO--AND IN GENERAL SHE FILLS THE WHOLE PAPER AND CROSSES
HALF. MY MOTHER OFTEN WONDERS THAT I CAN MAKE IT OUT SO WELL. SHE OFTEN
SAYS, WHEN THE LETTER IS FIRST OPENED, 'WELL, HETTY, NOW I THINK
YOU WILL BE PUT TO IT TO MAKE OUT ALL THAT CHECKER-WORK'--DON'T YOU,
MA'AM?--AND THEN I TELL HER, I AM SURE SHE WOULD CONTRIVE TO MAKE IT OUT
HERSELF, IF SHE HAD NOBODY TO DO IT FOR HER--EVERY WORD OF IT--I AM SURE
SHE WOULD PORE OVER IT TILL SHE HAD MADE OUT EVERY WORD. AND, INDEED,
THOUGH MY MOTHER'S EYES ARE NOT SO GOOD AS THEY WERE, SHE CAN SEE
AMAZINGLY WELL STILL, THANK GOD! WITH THE HELP OF SPECTACLES. IT IS SUCH
A BLESSING! MY MOTHER'S ARE REALLY VERY GOOD INDEED. JANE OFTEN SAYS,
WHEN SHE IS HERE, 'I AM SURE, GRANDMAMA, YOU MUST HAVE HAD VERY STRONG
EYES TO SEE AS YOU DO--AND SO MUCH FINE WORK AS YOU HAVE DONE TOO!--I
ONLY WISH MY EYES MAY LAST ME AS WELL.'"

ALL THIS SPOKEN EXTREMELY FAST OBLIGED MISS BATES TO STOP FOR BREATH;
AND EMMA SAID SOMETHING VERY CIVIL ABOUT THE EXCELLENCE OF MISS
FAIRFAX'S HANDWRITING.

"YOU ARE EXTREMELY KIND," REPLIED MISS BATES, HIGHLY GRATIFIED; "YOU WHO
ARE SUCH A JUDGE, AND WRITE SO BEAUTIFULLY YOURSELF. I AM SURE THERE IS
NOBODY'S PRAISE THAT COULD GIVE US SO MUCH PLEASURE AS MISS WOODHOUSE'S.
MY MOTHER DOES NOT HEAR; SHE IS A LITTLE DEAF YOU KNOW. MA'AM,"
ADDRESSING HER, "DO YOU HEAR WHAT MISS WOODHOUSE IS SO OBLIGING TO SAY
ABOUT JANE'S HANDWRITING?"

AND EMMA HAD THE ADVANTAGE OF HEARING HER OWN SILLY COMPLIMENT REPEATED
TWICE OVER BEFORE THE GOOD OLD LADY COULD COMPREHEND IT. SHE WAS
PONDERING, IN THE MEANWHILE, UPON THE POSSIBILITY, WITHOUT SEEMING VERY
RUDE, OF MAKING HER ESCAPE FROM JANE FAIRFAX'S LETTER, AND HAD ALMOST
RESOLVED ON HURRYING AWAY DIRECTLY UNDER SOME SLIGHT EXCUSE, WHEN MISS
BATES TURNED TO HER AGAIN AND SEIZED HER ATTENTION.

"MY MOTHER'S DEAFNESS IS VERY TRIFLING YOU SEE--JUST NOTHING AT ALL. BY
ONLY RAISING MY VOICE, AND SAYING ANY THING TWO OR THREE TIMES OVER,
SHE IS SURE TO HEAR; BUT THEN SHE IS USED TO MY VOICE. BUT IT IS VERY
REMARKABLE THAT SHE SHOULD ALWAYS HEAR JANE BETTER THAN SHE DOES ME.
JANE SPEAKS SO DISTINCT! HOWEVER, SHE WILL NOT FIND HER GRANDMAMA AT ALL
DEAFER THAN SHE WAS TWO YEARS AGO; WHICH IS SAYING A GREAT DEAL AT MY
MOTHER'S TIME OF LIFE--AND IT REALLY IS FULL TWO YEARS, YOU KNOW, SINCE
SHE WAS HERE. WE NEVER WERE SO LONG WITHOUT SEEING HER BEFORE, AND AS
I WAS TELLING MRS. COLE, WE SHALL HARDLY KNOW HOW TO MAKE ENOUGH OF HER
NOW."

"ARE YOU EXPECTING MISS FAIRFAX HERE SOON?"

"OH YES; NEXT WEEK."

"INDEED!--THAT MUST BE A VERY GREAT PLEASURE."

"THANK YOU. YOU ARE VERY KIND. YES, NEXT WEEK. EVERY BODY IS SO
SURPRIZED; AND EVERY BODY SAYS THE SAME OBLIGING THINGS. I AM SURE SHE
WILL BE AS HAPPY TO SEE HER FRIENDS AT HIGHBURY, AS THEY CAN BE TO SEE
HER. YES, FRIDAY OR SATURDAY; SHE CANNOT SAY WHICH, BECAUSE COLONEL
CAMPBELL WILL BE WANTING THE CARRIAGE HIMSELF ONE OF THOSE DAYS. SO VERY
GOOD OF THEM TO SEND HER THE WHOLE WAY! BUT THEY ALWAYS DO, YOU KNOW. OH
YES, FRIDAY OR SATURDAY NEXT. THAT IS WHAT SHE WRITES ABOUT. THAT IS
THE REASON OF HER WRITING OUT OF RULE, AS WE CALL IT; FOR, IN THE
COMMON COURSE, WE SHOULD NOT HAVE HEARD FROM HER BEFORE NEXT TUESDAY OR
WEDNESDAY."

"YES, SO I IMAGINED. I WAS AFRAID THERE COULD BE LITTLE CHANCE OF MY
HEARING ANY THING OF MISS FAIRFAX TO-DAY."

"SO OBLIGING OF YOU! NO, WE SHOULD NOT HAVE HEARD, IF IT HAD NOT BEEN
FOR THIS PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCE, OF HER BEING TO COME HERE SO SOON. MY
MOTHER IS SO DELIGHTED!--FOR SHE IS TO BE THREE MONTHS WITH US AT
LEAST. THREE MONTHS, SHE SAYS SO, POSITIVELY, AS I AM GOING TO HAVE THE
PLEASURE OF READING TO YOU. THE CASE IS, YOU SEE, THAT THE CAMPBELLS ARE
GOING TO IRELAND. MRS. DIXON HAS PERSUADED HER FATHER AND MOTHER TO COME
OVER AND SEE HER DIRECTLY. THEY HAD NOT INTENDED TO GO OVER TILL THE
SUMMER, BUT SHE IS SO IMPATIENT TO SEE THEM AGAIN--FOR TILL SHE MARRIED,
LAST OCTOBER, SHE WAS NEVER AWAY FROM THEM SO MUCH AS A WEEK, WHICH MUST
MAKE IT VERY STRANGE TO BE IN DIFFERENT KINGDOMS, I WAS GOING TO SAY,
BUT HOWEVER DIFFERENT COUNTRIES, AND SO SHE WROTE A VERY URGENT LETTER
TO HER MOTHER--OR HER FATHER, I DECLARE I DO NOT KNOW WHICH IT WAS, BUT
WE SHALL SEE PRESENTLY IN JANE'S LETTER--WROTE IN MR. DIXON'S NAME AS
WELL AS HER OWN, TO PRESS THEIR COMING OVER DIRECTLY, AND THEY WOULD
GIVE THEM THE MEETING IN DUBLIN, AND TAKE THEM BACK TO THEIR COUNTRY
SEAT, BALY-CRAIG, A BEAUTIFUL PLACE, I FANCY. JANE HAS HEARD A GREAT
DEAL OF ITS BEAUTY; FROM MR. DIXON, I MEAN--I DO NOT KNOW THAT SHE EVER
HEARD ABOUT IT FROM ANY BODY ELSE; BUT IT WAS VERY NATURAL, YOU KNOW,
THAT HE SHOULD LIKE TO SPEAK OF HIS OWN PLACE WHILE HE WAS PAYING HIS
ADDRESSES--AND AS JANE USED TO BE VERY OFTEN WALKING OUT WITH THEM--FOR
COLONEL AND MRS. CAMPBELL WERE VERY PARTICULAR ABOUT THEIR DAUGHTER'S
NOT WALKING OUT OFTEN WITH ONLY MR. DIXON, FOR WHICH I DO NOT AT ALL
BLAME THEM; OF COURSE SHE HEARD EVERY THING HE MIGHT BE TELLING MISS
CAMPBELL ABOUT HIS OWN HOME IN IRELAND; AND I THINK SHE WROTE US WORD
THAT HE HAD SHEWN THEM SOME DRAWINGS OF THE PLACE, VIEWS THAT HE HAD
TAKEN HIMSELF. HE IS A MOST AMIABLE, CHARMING YOUNG MAN, I BELIEVE. JANE
WAS QUITE LONGING TO GO TO IRELAND, FROM HIS ACCOUNT OF THINGS."

AT THIS MOMENT, AN INGENIOUS AND ANIMATING SUSPICION ENTERING EMMA'S
BRAIN WITH REGARD TO JANE FAIRFAX, THIS CHARMING MR. DIXON, AND THE
NOT GOING TO IRELAND, SHE SAID, WITH THE INSIDIOUS DESIGN OF FARTHER
DISCOVERY,

"YOU MUST FEEL IT VERY FORTUNATE THAT MISS FAIRFAX SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO
COME TO YOU AT SUCH A TIME. CONSIDERING THE VERY PARTICULAR FRIENDSHIP
BETWEEN HER AND MRS. DIXON, YOU COULD HARDLY HAVE EXPECTED HER TO BE
EXCUSED FROM ACCOMPANYING COLONEL AND MRS. CAMPBELL."

"VERY TRUE, VERY TRUE, INDEED. THE VERY THING THAT WE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN
RATHER AFRAID OF; FOR WE SHOULD NOT HAVE LIKED TO HAVE HER AT SUCH A
DISTANCE FROM US, FOR MONTHS TOGETHER--NOT ABLE TO COME IF ANY THING WAS
TO HAPPEN. BUT YOU SEE, EVERY THING TURNS OUT FOR THE BEST. THEY WANT
HER (MR. AND MRS. DIXON) EXCESSIVELY TO COME OVER WITH COLONEL AND MRS.
CAMPBELL; QUITE DEPEND UPON IT; NOTHING CAN BE MORE KIND OR PRESSING
THAN THEIR JOINT INVITATION, JANE SAYS, AS YOU WILL HEAR PRESENTLY;
MR. DIXON DOES NOT SEEM IN THE LEAST BACKWARD IN ANY ATTENTION. HE IS
A MOST CHARMING YOUNG MAN. EVER SINCE THE SERVICE HE RENDERED JANE AT
WEYMOUTH, WHEN THEY WERE OUT IN THAT PARTY ON THE WATER, AND SHE, BY THE
SUDDEN WHIRLING ROUND OF SOMETHING OR OTHER AMONG THE SAILS, WOULD HAVE
BEEN DASHED INTO THE SEA AT ONCE, AND ACTUALLY WAS ALL BUT GONE, IF HE
HAD NOT, WITH THE GREATEST PRESENCE OF MIND, CAUGHT HOLD OF HER HABIT--
(I CAN NEVER THINK OF IT WITHOUT TREMBLING!)--BUT EVER SINCE WE HAD THE
HISTORY OF THAT DAY, I HAVE BEEN SO FOND OF MR. DIXON!"

"BUT, IN SPITE OF ALL HER FRIENDS' URGENCY, AND HER OWN WISH OF SEEING
IRELAND, MISS FAIRFAX PREFERS DEVOTING THE TIME TO YOU AND MRS. BATES?"

"YES--ENTIRELY HER OWN DOING, ENTIRELY HER OWN CHOICE; AND COLONEL
AND MRS. CAMPBELL THINK SHE DOES QUITE RIGHT, JUST WHAT THEY SHOULD
RECOMMEND; AND INDEED THEY PARTICULARLY WISH HER TO TRY HER NATIVE
AIR, AS SHE HAS NOT BEEN QUITE SO WELL AS USUAL LATELY."

"I AM CONCERNED TO HEAR OF IT. I THINK THEY JUDGE WISELY. BUT MRS.
DIXON MUST BE VERY MUCH DISAPPOINTED. MRS. DIXON, I UNDERSTAND, HAS
NO REMARKABLE DEGREE OF PERSONAL BEAUTY; IS NOT, BY ANY MEANS, TO BE
COMPARED WITH MISS FAIRFAX."

"OH! NO. YOU ARE VERY OBLIGING TO SAY SUCH THINGS--BUT CERTAINLY NOT.
THERE IS NO COMPARISON BETWEEN THEM. MISS CAMPBELL ALWAYS WAS ABSOLUTELY
PLAIN--BUT EXTREMELY ELEGANT AND AMIABLE."

"YES, THAT OF COURSE."

"JANE CAUGHT A BAD COLD, POOR THING! SO LONG AGO AS THE 7TH OF NOVEMBER,
(AS I AM GOING TO READ TO YOU,) AND HAS NEVER BEEN WELL SINCE. A LONG
TIME, IS NOT IT, FOR A COLD TO HANG UPON HER? SHE NEVER MENTIONED
IT BEFORE, BECAUSE SHE WOULD NOT ALARM US. JUST LIKE HER! SO
CONSIDERATE!--BUT HOWEVER, SHE IS SO FAR FROM WELL, THAT HER KIND
FRIENDS THE CAMPBELLS THINK SHE HAD BETTER COME HOME, AND TRY AN AIR
THAT ALWAYS AGREES WITH HER; AND THEY HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THREE OR FOUR
MONTHS AT HIGHBURY WILL ENTIRELY CURE HER--AND IT IS CERTAINLY A GREAT
DEAL BETTER THAT SHE SHOULD COME HERE, THAN GO TO IRELAND, IF SHE IS
UNWELL. NOBODY COULD NURSE HER, AS WE SHOULD DO."

"IT APPEARS TO ME THE MOST DESIRABLE ARRANGEMENT IN THE WORLD."

"AND SO SHE IS TO COME TO US NEXT FRIDAY OR SATURDAY, AND THE CAMPBELLS
LEAVE TOWN IN THEIR WAY TO HOLYHEAD THE MONDAY FOLLOWING--AS YOU WILL
FIND FROM JANE'S LETTER. SO SUDDEN!--YOU MAY GUESS, DEAR MISS WOODHOUSE,
WHAT A FLURRY IT HAS THROWN ME IN! IF IT WAS NOT FOR THE DRAWBACK OF
HER ILLNESS--BUT I AM AFRAID WE MUST EXPECT TO SEE HER GROWN THIN, AND
LOOKING VERY POORLY. I MUST TELL YOU WHAT AN UNLUCKY THING HAPPENED TO
ME, AS TO THAT. I ALWAYS MAKE A POINT OF READING JANE'S LETTERS THROUGH
TO MYSELF FIRST, BEFORE I READ THEM ALOUD TO MY MOTHER, YOU KNOW, FOR
FEAR OF THERE BEING ANY THING IN THEM TO DISTRESS HER. JANE DESIRED ME
TO DO IT, SO I ALWAYS DO: AND SO I BEGAN TO-DAY WITH MY USUAL CAUTION;
BUT NO SOONER DID I COME TO THE MENTION OF HER BEING UNWELL, THAN I
BURST OUT, QUITE FRIGHTENED, WITH 'BLESS ME! POOR JANE IS ILL!'--WHICH
MY MOTHER, BEING ON THE WATCH, HEARD DISTINCTLY, AND WAS SADLY ALARMED
AT. HOWEVER, WHEN I READ ON, I FOUND IT WAS NOT NEAR SO BAD AS I HAD
FANCIED AT FIRST; AND I MAKE SO LIGHT OF IT NOW TO HER, THAT SHE DOES
NOT THINK MUCH ABOUT IT. BUT I CANNOT IMAGINE HOW I COULD BE SO OFF MY
GUARD. IF JANE DOES NOT GET WELL SOON, WE WILL CALL IN MR. PERRY. THE
EXPENSE SHALL NOT BE THOUGHT OF; AND THOUGH HE IS SO LIBERAL, AND SO
FOND OF JANE THAT I DARE SAY HE WOULD NOT MEAN TO CHARGE ANY THING FOR
ATTENDANCE, WE COULD NOT SUFFER IT TO BE SO, YOU KNOW. HE HAS A WIFE AND
FAMILY TO MAINTAIN, AND IS NOT TO BE GIVING AWAY HIS TIME. WELL, NOW I
HAVE JUST GIVEN YOU A HINT OF WHAT JANE WRITES ABOUT, WE WILL TURN TO
HER LETTER, AND I AM SURE SHE TELLS HER OWN STORY A GREAT DEAL BETTER
THAN I CAN TELL IT FOR HER."

"I AM AFRAID WE MUST BE RUNNING AWAY," SAID EMMA, GLANCING AT HARRIET,
AND BEGINNING TO RISE--"MY FATHER WILL BE EXPECTING US. I HAD NO
INTENTION, I THOUGHT I HAD NO POWER OF STAYING MORE THAN FIVE MINUTES,
WHEN I FIRST ENTERED THE HOUSE. I MERELY CALLED, BECAUSE I WOULD NOT
PASS THE DOOR WITHOUT INQUIRING AFTER MRS. BATES; BUT I HAVE BEEN SO
PLEASANTLY DETAINED! NOW, HOWEVER, WE MUST WISH YOU AND MRS. BATES GOOD
MORNING."

AND NOT ALL THAT COULD BE URGED TO DETAIN HER SUCCEEDED. SHE REGAINED
THE STREET--HAPPY IN THIS, THAT THOUGH MUCH HAD BEEN FORCED ON HER
AGAINST HER WILL, THOUGH SHE HAD IN FACT HEARD THE WHOLE SUBSTANCE OF
JANE FAIRFAX'S LETTER, SHE HAD BEEN ABLE TO ESCAPE THE LETTER ITSELF.



CHAPTER II


JANE FAIRFAX WAS AN ORPHAN, THE ONLY CHILD OF MRS. BATES'S YOUNGEST
DAUGHTER.

THE MARRIAGE OF LIEUT. FAIRFAX OF THE ----REGIMENT OF INFANTRY,
AND MISS JANE BATES, HAD HAD ITS DAY OF FAME AND PLEASURE, HOPE
AND INTEREST; BUT NOTHING NOW REMAINED OF IT, SAVE THE MELANCHOLY
REMEMBRANCE OF HIM DYING IN ACTION ABROAD--OF HIS WIDOW SINKING UNDER
CONSUMPTION AND GRIEF SOON AFTERWARDS--AND THIS GIRL.

BY BIRTH SHE BELONGED TO HIGHBURY: AND WHEN AT THREE YEARS OLD, ON
LOSING HER MOTHER, SHE BECAME THE PROPERTY, THE CHARGE, THE CONSOLATION,
THE FONDLING OF HER GRANDMOTHER AND AUNT, THERE HAD SEEMED EVERY
PROBABILITY OF HER BEING PERMANENTLY FIXED THERE; OF HER BEING TAUGHT
ONLY WHAT VERY LIMITED MEANS COULD COMMAND, AND GROWING UP WITH NO
ADVANTAGES OF CONNEXION OR IMPROVEMENT, TO BE ENGRAFTED ON WHAT
NATURE HAD GIVEN HER IN A PLEASING PERSON, GOOD UNDERSTANDING, AND
WARM-HEARTED, WELL-MEANING RELATIONS.

BUT THE COMPASSIONATE FEELINGS OF A FRIEND OF HER FATHER GAVE A CHANGE
TO HER DESTINY. THIS WAS COLONEL CAMPBELL, WHO HAD VERY HIGHLY REGARDED
FAIRFAX, AS AN EXCELLENT OFFICER AND MOST DESERVING YOUNG MAN; AND
FARTHER, HAD BEEN INDEBTED TO HIM FOR SUCH ATTENTIONS, DURING A SEVERE
CAMP-FEVER, AS HE BELIEVED HAD SAVED HIS LIFE. THESE WERE CLAIMS WHICH
HE DID NOT LEARN TO OVERLOOK, THOUGH SOME YEARS PASSED AWAY FROM THE
DEATH OF POOR FAIRFAX, BEFORE HIS OWN RETURN TO ENGLAND PUT ANY THING IN
HIS POWER. WHEN HE DID RETURN, HE SOUGHT OUT THE CHILD AND TOOK NOTICE
OF HER. HE WAS A MARRIED MAN, WITH ONLY ONE LIVING CHILD, A GIRL, ABOUT
JANE'S AGE: AND JANE BECAME THEIR GUEST, PAYING THEM LONG VISITS AND
GROWING A FAVOURITE WITH ALL; AND BEFORE SHE WAS NINE YEARS OLD, HIS
DAUGHTER'S GREAT FONDNESS FOR HER, AND HIS OWN WISH OF BEING A REAL
FRIEND, UNITED TO PRODUCE AN OFFER FROM COLONEL CAMPBELL OF UNDERTAKING
THE WHOLE CHARGE OF HER EDUCATION. IT WAS ACCEPTED; AND FROM THAT PERIOD
JANE HAD BELONGED TO COLONEL CAMPBELL'S FAMILY, AND HAD LIVED WITH THEM
ENTIRELY, ONLY VISITING HER GRANDMOTHER FROM TIME TO TIME.

THE PLAN WAS THAT SHE SHOULD BE BROUGHT UP FOR EDUCATING OTHERS; THE
VERY FEW HUNDRED POUNDS WHICH SHE INHERITED FROM HER FATHER MAKING
INDEPENDENCE IMPOSSIBLE. TO PROVIDE FOR HER OTHERWISE WAS OUT OF COLONEL
CAMPBELL'S POWER; FOR THOUGH HIS INCOME, BY PAY AND APPOINTMENTS, WAS
HANDSOME, HIS FORTUNE WAS MODERATE AND MUST BE ALL HIS DAUGHTER'S;
BUT, BY GIVING HER AN EDUCATION, HE HOPED TO BE SUPPLYING THE MEANS OF
RESPECTABLE SUBSISTENCE HEREAFTER.

SUCH WAS JANE FAIRFAX'S HISTORY. SHE HAD FALLEN INTO GOOD HANDS, KNOWN
NOTHING BUT KINDNESS FROM THE CAMPBELLS, AND BEEN GIVEN AN EXCELLENT
EDUCATION. LIVING CONSTANTLY WITH RIGHT-MINDED AND WELL-INFORMED PEOPLE,
HER HEART AND UNDERSTANDING HAD RECEIVED EVERY ADVANTAGE OF DISCIPLINE
AND CULTURE; AND COLONEL CAMPBELL'S RESIDENCE BEING IN LONDON, EVERY
LIGHTER TALENT HAD BEEN DONE FULL JUSTICE TO, BY THE ATTENDANCE OF
FIRST-RATE MASTERS. HER DISPOSITION AND ABILITIES WERE EQUALLY WORTHY
OF ALL THAT FRIENDSHIP COULD DO; AND AT EIGHTEEN OR NINETEEN SHE WAS,
AS FAR AS SUCH AN EARLY AGE CAN BE QUALIFIED FOR THE CARE OF CHILDREN,
FULLY COMPETENT TO THE OFFICE OF INSTRUCTION HERSELF; BUT SHE WAS TOO
MUCH BELOVED TO BE PARTED WITH. NEITHER FATHER NOR MOTHER COULD PROMOTE,
AND THE DAUGHTER COULD NOT ENDURE IT. THE EVIL DAY WAS PUT OFF. IT WAS
EASY TO DECIDE THAT SHE WAS STILL TOO YOUNG; AND JANE REMAINED WITH
THEM, SHARING, AS ANOTHER DAUGHTER, IN ALL THE RATIONAL PLEASURES OF
AN ELEGANT SOCIETY, AND A JUDICIOUS MIXTURE OF HOME AND AMUSEMENT, WITH
ONLY THE DRAWBACK OF THE FUTURE, THE SOBERING SUGGESTIONS OF HER OWN
GOOD UNDERSTANDING TO REMIND HER THAT ALL THIS MIGHT SOON BE OVER.

THE AFFECTION OF THE WHOLE FAMILY, THE WARM ATTACHMENT OF MISS
CAMPBELL IN PARTICULAR, WAS THE MORE HONOURABLE TO EACH PARTY FROM
THE CIRCUMSTANCE OF JANE'S DECIDED SUPERIORITY BOTH IN BEAUTY AND
ACQUIREMENTS. THAT NATURE HAD GIVEN IT IN FEATURE COULD NOT BE UNSEEN
BY THE YOUNG WOMAN, NOR COULD HER HIGHER POWERS OF MIND BE UNFELT BY THE
PARENTS. THEY CONTINUED TOGETHER WITH UNABATED REGARD HOWEVER, TILL THE
MARRIAGE OF MISS CAMPBELL, WHO BY THAT CHANCE, THAT LUCK WHICH SO OFTEN
DEFIES ANTICIPATION IN MATRIMONIAL AFFAIRS, GIVING ATTRACTION TO WHAT IS
MODERATE RATHER THAN TO WHAT IS SUPERIOR, ENGAGED THE AFFECTIONS OF
MR. DIXON, A YOUNG MAN, RICH AND AGREEABLE, ALMOST AS SOON AS THEY WERE
ACQUAINTED; AND WAS ELIGIBLY AND HAPPILY SETTLED, WHILE JANE FAIRFAX HAD
YET HER BREAD TO EARN.

THIS EVENT HAD VERY LATELY TAKEN PLACE; TOO LATELY FOR ANY THING TO BE
YET ATTEMPTED BY HER LESS FORTUNATE FRIEND TOWARDS ENTERING ON HER PATH
OF DUTY; THOUGH SHE HAD NOW REACHED THE AGE WHICH HER OWN JUDGMENT HAD
FIXED ON FOR BEGINNING. SHE HAD LONG RESOLVED THAT ONE-AND-TWENTY
SHOULD BE THE PERIOD. WITH THE FORTITUDE OF A DEVOTED NOVITIATE, SHE HAD
RESOLVED AT ONE-AND-TWENTY TO COMPLETE THE SACRIFICE, AND RETIRE FROM
ALL THE PLEASURES OF LIFE, OF RATIONAL INTERCOURSE, EQUAL SOCIETY, PEACE
AND HOPE, TO PENANCE AND MORTIFICATION FOR EVER.

THE GOOD SENSE OF COLONEL AND MRS. CAMPBELL COULD NOT OPPOSE SUCH
A RESOLUTION, THOUGH THEIR FEELINGS DID. AS LONG AS THEY LIVED, NO
EXERTIONS WOULD BE NECESSARY, THEIR HOME MIGHT BE HERS FOR EVER; AND FOR
THEIR OWN COMFORT THEY WOULD HAVE RETAINED HER WHOLLY; BUT THIS WOULD
BE SELFISHNESS:--WHAT MUST BE AT LAST, HAD BETTER BE SOON. PERHAPS THEY
BEGAN TO FEEL IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN KINDER AND WISER TO HAVE RESISTED THE
TEMPTATION OF ANY DELAY, AND SPARED HER FROM A TASTE OF SUCH ENJOYMENTS
OF EASE AND LEISURE AS MUST NOW BE RELINQUISHED. STILL, HOWEVER,
AFFECTION WAS GLAD TO CATCH AT ANY REASONABLE EXCUSE FOR NOT HURRYING
ON THE WRETCHED MOMENT. SHE HAD NEVER BEEN QUITE WELL SINCE THE TIME OF
THEIR DAUGHTER'S MARRIAGE; AND TILL SHE SHOULD HAVE COMPLETELY RECOVERED
HER USUAL STRENGTH, THEY MUST FORBID HER ENGAGING IN DUTIES, WHICH, SO
FAR FROM BEING COMPATIBLE WITH A WEAKENED FRAME AND VARYING SPIRITS,
SEEMED, UNDER THE MOST FAVOURABLE CIRCUMSTANCES, TO REQUIRE SOMETHING
MORE THAN HUMAN PERFECTION OF BODY AND MIND TO BE DISCHARGED WITH
TOLERABLE COMFORT.

WITH REGARD TO HER NOT ACCOMPANYING THEM TO IRELAND, HER ACCOUNT TO HER
AUNT CONTAINED NOTHING BUT TRUTH, THOUGH THERE MIGHT BE SOME TRUTHS
NOT TOLD. IT WAS HER OWN CHOICE TO GIVE THE TIME OF THEIR ABSENCE TO
HIGHBURY; TO SPEND, PERHAPS, HER LAST MONTHS OF PERFECT LIBERTY WITH
THOSE KIND RELATIONS TO WHOM SHE WAS SO VERY DEAR: AND THE CAMPBELLS,
WHATEVER MIGHT BE THEIR MOTIVE OR MOTIVES, WHETHER SINGLE, OR DOUBLE, OR
TREBLE, GAVE THE ARRANGEMENT THEIR READY SANCTION, AND SAID, THAT THEY
DEPENDED MORE ON A FEW MONTHS SPENT IN HER NATIVE AIR, FOR THE RECOVERY
OF HER HEALTH, THAN ON ANY THING ELSE. CERTAIN IT WAS THAT SHE WAS TO
COME; AND THAT HIGHBURY, INSTEAD OF WELCOMING THAT PERFECT NOVELTY WHICH
HAD BEEN SO LONG PROMISED IT--MR. FRANK CHURCHILL--MUST PUT UP FOR THE
PRESENT WITH JANE FAIRFAX, WHO COULD BRING ONLY THE FRESHNESS OF A TWO
YEARS' ABSENCE.

EMMA WAS SORRY;--TO HAVE TO PAY CIVILITIES TO A PERSON SHE DID NOT LIKE
THROUGH THREE LONG MONTHS!--TO BE ALWAYS DOING MORE THAN SHE WISHED,
AND LESS THAN SHE OUGHT! WHY SHE DID NOT LIKE JANE FAIRFAX MIGHT BE A
DIFFICULT QUESTION TO ANSWER; MR. KNIGHTLEY HAD ONCE TOLD HER IT WAS
BECAUSE SHE SAW IN HER THE REALLY ACCOMPLISHED YOUNG WOMAN, WHICH SHE
WANTED TO BE THOUGHT HERSELF; AND THOUGH THE ACCUSATION HAD BEEN EAGERLY
REFUTED AT THE TIME, THERE WERE MOMENTS OF SELF-EXAMINATION IN WHICH
HER CONSCIENCE COULD NOT QUITE ACQUIT HER. BUT "SHE COULD NEVER GET
ACQUAINTED WITH HER: SHE DID NOT KNOW HOW IT WAS, BUT THERE WAS SUCH
COLDNESS AND RESERVE--SUCH APPARENT INDIFFERENCE WHETHER SHE PLEASED OR
NOT--AND THEN, HER AUNT WAS SUCH AN ETERNAL TALKER!--AND SHE WAS MADE
SUCH A FUSS WITH BY EVERY BODY!--AND IT HAD BEEN ALWAYS IMAGINED THAT
THEY WERE TO BE SO INTIMATE--BECAUSE THEIR AGES WERE THE SAME, EVERY
BODY HAD SUPPOSED THEY MUST BE SO FOND OF EACH OTHER." THESE WERE HER
REASONS--SHE HAD NO BETTER.

IT WAS A DISLIKE SO LITTLE JUST--EVERY IMPUTED FAULT WAS SO MAGNIFIED
BY FANCY, THAT SHE NEVER SAW JANE FAIRFAX THE FIRST TIME AFTER ANY
CONSIDERABLE ABSENCE, WITHOUT FEELING THAT SHE HAD INJURED HER; AND
NOW, WHEN THE DUE VISIT WAS PAID, ON HER ARRIVAL, AFTER A TWO YEARS'
INTERVAL, SHE WAS PARTICULARLY STRUCK WITH THE VERY APPEARANCE AND
MANNERS, WHICH FOR THOSE TWO WHOLE YEARS SHE HAD BEEN DEPRECIATING. JANE
FAIRFAX WAS VERY ELEGANT, REMARKABLY ELEGANT; AND SHE HAD HERSELF THE
HIGHEST VALUE FOR ELEGANCE. HER HEIGHT WAS PRETTY, JUST SUCH AS ALMOST
EVERY BODY WOULD THINK TALL, AND NOBODY COULD THINK VERY TALL; HER
FIGURE PARTICULARLY GRACEFUL; HER SIZE A MOST BECOMING MEDIUM, BETWEEN
FAT AND THIN, THOUGH A SLIGHT APPEARANCE OF ILL-HEALTH SEEMED TO POINT
OUT THE LIKELIEST EVIL OF THE TWO. EMMA COULD NOT BUT FEEL ALL THIS; AND
THEN, HER FACE--HER FEATURES--THERE WAS MORE BEAUTY IN THEM ALTOGETHER
THAN SHE HAD REMEMBERED; IT WAS NOT REGULAR, BUT IT WAS VERY PLEASING
BEAUTY. HER EYES, A DEEP GREY, WITH DARK EYE-LASHES AND EYEBROWS, HAD
NEVER BEEN DENIED THEIR PRAISE; BUT THE SKIN, WHICH SHE HAD BEEN USED TO
CAVIL AT, AS WANTING COLOUR, HAD A CLEARNESS AND DELICACY WHICH REALLY
NEEDED NO FULLER BLOOM. IT WAS A STYLE OF BEAUTY, OF WHICH ELEGANCE WAS
THE REIGNING CHARACTER, AND AS SUCH, SHE MUST, IN HONOUR, BY ALL HER
PRINCIPLES, ADMIRE IT:--ELEGANCE, WHICH, WHETHER OF PERSON OR OF MIND,
SHE SAW SO LITTLE IN HIGHBURY. THERE, NOT TO BE VULGAR, WAS DISTINCTION,
AND MERIT.

IN SHORT, SHE SAT, DURING THE FIRST VISIT, LOOKING AT JANE FAIRFAX WITH
TWOFOLD COMPLACENCY; THE SENSE OF PLEASURE AND THE SENSE OF RENDERING
JUSTICE, AND WAS DETERMINING THAT SHE WOULD DISLIKE HER NO LONGER. WHEN
SHE TOOK IN HER HISTORY, INDEED, HER SITUATION, AS WELL AS HER BEAUTY;
WHEN SHE CONSIDERED WHAT ALL THIS ELEGANCE WAS DESTINED TO, WHAT SHE WAS
GOING TO SINK FROM, HOW SHE WAS GOING TO LIVE, IT SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE
TO FEEL ANY THING BUT COMPASSION AND RESPECT; ESPECIALLY, IF TO EVERY
WELL-KNOWN PARTICULAR ENTITLING HER TO INTEREST, WERE ADDED THE HIGHLY
PROBABLE CIRCUMSTANCE OF AN ATTACHMENT TO MR. DIXON, WHICH SHE HAD
SO NATURALLY STARTED TO HERSELF. IN THAT CASE, NOTHING COULD BE MORE
PITIABLE OR MORE HONOURABLE THAN THE SACRIFICES SHE HAD RESOLVED ON.
EMMA WAS VERY WILLING NOW TO ACQUIT HER OF HAVING SEDUCED MR. DIXON'S
ACTIONS FROM HIS WIFE, OR OF ANY THING MISCHIEVOUS WHICH HER IMAGINATION
HAD SUGGESTED AT FIRST. IF IT WERE LOVE, IT MIGHT BE SIMPLE, SINGLE,
SUCCESSLESS LOVE ON HER SIDE ALONE. SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN UNCONSCIOUSLY
SUCKING IN THE SAD POISON, WHILE A SHARER OF HIS CONVERSATION WITH HER
FRIEND; AND FROM THE BEST, THE PUREST OF MOTIVES, MIGHT NOW BE
DENYING HERSELF THIS VISIT TO IRELAND, AND RESOLVING TO DIVIDE HERSELF
EFFECTUALLY FROM HIM AND HIS CONNEXIONS BY SOON BEGINNING HER CAREER OF
LABORIOUS DUTY.

UPON THE WHOLE, EMMA LEFT HER WITH SUCH SOFTENED, CHARITABLE FEELINGS,
AS MADE HER LOOK AROUND IN WALKING HOME, AND LAMENT THAT HIGHBURY
AFFORDED NO YOUNG MAN WORTHY OF GIVING HER INDEPENDENCE; NOBODY THAT SHE
COULD WISH TO SCHEME ABOUT FOR HER.

THESE WERE CHARMING FEELINGS--BUT NOT LASTING. BEFORE SHE HAD COMMITTED
HERSELF BY ANY PUBLIC PROFESSION OF ETERNAL FRIENDSHIP FOR JANE FAIRFAX,
OR DONE MORE TOWARDS A RECANTATION OF PAST PREJUDICES AND ERRORS, THAN
SAYING TO MR. KNIGHTLEY, "SHE CERTAINLY IS HANDSOME; SHE IS BETTER THAN
HANDSOME!" JANE HAD SPENT AN EVENING AT HARTFIELD WITH HER GRANDMOTHER
AND AUNT, AND EVERY THING WAS RELAPSING MUCH INTO ITS USUAL STATE.
FORMER PROVOCATIONS REAPPEARED. THE AUNT WAS AS TIRESOME AS EVER; MORE
TIRESOME, BECAUSE ANXIETY FOR HER HEALTH WAS NOW ADDED TO ADMIRATION
OF HER POWERS; AND THEY HAD TO LISTEN TO THE DESCRIPTION OF EXACTLY HOW
LITTLE BREAD AND BUTTER SHE ATE FOR BREAKFAST, AND HOW SMALL A SLICE
OF MUTTON FOR DINNER, AS WELL AS TO SEE EXHIBITIONS OF NEW CAPS AND NEW
WORKBAGS FOR HER MOTHER AND HERSELF; AND JANE'S OFFENCES ROSE AGAIN.
THEY HAD MUSIC; EMMA WAS OBLIGED TO PLAY; AND THE THANKS AND PRAISE
WHICH NECESSARILY FOLLOWED APPEARED TO HER AN AFFECTATION OF CANDOUR, AN
AIR OF GREATNESS, MEANING ONLY TO SHEW OFF IN HIGHER STYLE HER OWN VERY
SUPERIOR PERFORMANCE. SHE WAS, BESIDES, WHICH WAS THE WORST OF ALL, SO
COLD, SO CAUTIOUS! THERE WAS NO GETTING AT HER REAL OPINION. WRAPT UP IN
A CLOAK OF POLITENESS, SHE SEEMED DETERMINED TO HAZARD NOTHING. SHE WAS
DISGUSTINGLY, WAS SUSPICIOUSLY RESERVED.

IF ANY THING COULD BE MORE, WHERE ALL WAS MOST, SHE WAS MORE RESERVED ON
THE SUBJECT OF WEYMOUTH AND THE DIXONS THAN ANY THING. SHE SEEMED BENT
ON GIVING NO REAL INSIGHT INTO MR. DIXON'S CHARACTER, OR HER OWN VALUE
FOR HIS COMPANY, OR OPINION OF THE SUITABLENESS OF THE MATCH. IT WAS ALL
GENERAL APPROBATION AND SMOOTHNESS; NOTHING DELINEATED OR DISTINGUISHED.
IT DID HER NO SERVICE HOWEVER. HER CAUTION WAS THROWN AWAY. EMMA SAW
ITS ARTIFICE, AND RETURNED TO HER FIRST SURMISES. THERE PROBABLY WAS
SOMETHING MORE TO CONCEAL THAN HER OWN PREFERENCE; MR. DIXON, PERHAPS,
HAD BEEN VERY NEAR CHANGING ONE FRIEND FOR THE OTHER, OR BEEN FIXED ONLY
TO MISS CAMPBELL, FOR THE SAKE OF THE FUTURE TWELVE THOUSAND POUNDS.

THE LIKE RESERVE PREVAILED ON OTHER TOPICS. SHE AND MR. FRANK CHURCHILL
HAD BEEN AT WEYMOUTH AT THE SAME TIME. IT WAS KNOWN THAT THEY WERE A
LITTLE ACQUAINTED; BUT NOT A SYLLABLE OF REAL INFORMATION COULD EMMA
PROCURE AS TO WHAT HE TRULY WAS. "WAS HE HANDSOME?"--"SHE BELIEVED
HE WAS RECKONED A VERY FINE YOUNG MAN." "WAS HE AGREEABLE?"--"HE WAS
GENERALLY THOUGHT SO." "DID HE APPEAR A SENSIBLE YOUNG MAN; A YOUNG
MAN OF INFORMATION?"--"AT A WATERING-PLACE, OR IN A COMMON LONDON
ACQUAINTANCE, IT WAS DIFFICULT TO DECIDE ON SUCH POINTS. MANNERS WERE
ALL THAT COULD BE SAFELY JUDGED OF, UNDER A MUCH LONGER KNOWLEDGE THAN
THEY HAD YET HAD OF MR. CHURCHILL. SHE BELIEVED EVERY BODY FOUND HIS
MANNERS PLEASING." EMMA COULD NOT FORGIVE HER.



CHAPTER III


EMMA COULD NOT FORGIVE HER;--BUT AS NEITHER PROVOCATION NOR RESENTMENT
WERE DISCERNED BY MR. KNIGHTLEY, WHO HAD BEEN OF THE PARTY, AND HAD
SEEN ONLY PROPER ATTENTION AND PLEASING BEHAVIOUR ON EACH SIDE, HE WAS
EXPRESSING THE NEXT MORNING, BEING AT HARTFIELD AGAIN ON BUSINESS WITH
MR. WOODHOUSE, HIS APPROBATION OF THE WHOLE; NOT SO OPENLY AS HE MIGHT
HAVE DONE HAD HER FATHER BEEN OUT OF THE ROOM, BUT SPEAKING PLAIN ENOUGH
TO BE VERY INTELLIGIBLE TO EMMA. HE HAD BEEN USED TO THINK HER UNJUST TO
JANE, AND HAD NOW GREAT PLEASURE IN MARKING AN IMPROVEMENT.

"A VERY PLEASANT EVENING," HE BEGAN, AS SOON AS MR. WOODHOUSE HAD BEEN
TALKED INTO WHAT WAS NECESSARY, TOLD THAT HE UNDERSTOOD, AND THE PAPERS
SWEPT AWAY;--"PARTICULARLY PLEASANT. YOU AND MISS FAIRFAX GAVE US SOME
VERY GOOD MUSIC. I DO NOT KNOW A MORE LUXURIOUS STATE, SIR, THAN SITTING
AT ONE'S EASE TO BE ENTERTAINED A WHOLE EVENING BY TWO SUCH YOUNG WOMEN;
SOMETIMES WITH MUSIC AND SOMETIMES WITH CONVERSATION. I AM SURE MISS
FAIRFAX MUST HAVE FOUND THE EVENING PLEASANT, EMMA. YOU LEFT NOTHING
UNDONE. I WAS GLAD YOU MADE HER PLAY SO MUCH, FOR HAVING NO INSTRUMENT
AT HER GRANDMOTHER'S, IT MUST HAVE BEEN A REAL INDULGENCE."

"I AM HAPPY YOU APPROVED," SAID EMMA, SMILING; "BUT I HOPE I AM NOT
OFTEN DEFICIENT IN WHAT IS DUE TO GUESTS AT HARTFIELD."

"NO, MY DEAR," SAID HER FATHER INSTANTLY; "THAT I AM SURE YOU ARE NOT.
THERE IS NOBODY HALF SO ATTENTIVE AND CIVIL AS YOU ARE. IF ANY THING,
YOU ARE TOO ATTENTIVE. THE MUFFIN LAST NIGHT--IF IT HAD BEEN HANDED
ROUND ONCE, I THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN ENOUGH."

"NO," SAID MR. KNIGHTLEY, NEARLY AT THE SAME TIME; "YOU ARE NOT OFTEN
DEFICIENT; NOT OFTEN DEFICIENT EITHER IN MANNER OR COMPREHENSION. I
THINK YOU UNDERSTAND ME, THEREFORE."

AN ARCH LOOK EXPRESSED--"I UNDERSTAND YOU WELL ENOUGH;" BUT SHE SAID
ONLY, "MISS FAIRFAX IS RESERVED."

"I ALWAYS TOLD YOU SHE WAS--A LITTLE; BUT YOU WILL SOON OVERCOME ALL
THAT PART OF HER RESERVE WHICH OUGHT TO BE OVERCOME, ALL THAT HAS ITS
FOUNDATION IN DIFFIDENCE. WHAT ARISES FROM DISCRETION MUST BE HONOURED."

"YOU THINK HER DIFFIDENT. I DO NOT SEE IT."

"MY DEAR EMMA," SAID HE, MOVING FROM HIS CHAIR INTO ONE CLOSE BY HER,
"YOU ARE NOT GOING TO TELL ME, I HOPE, THAT YOU HAD NOT A PLEASANT
EVENING."

"OH! NO; I WAS PLEASED WITH MY OWN PERSEVERANCE IN ASKING QUESTIONS; AND
AMUSED TO THINK HOW LITTLE INFORMATION I OBTAINED."

"I AM DISAPPOINTED," WAS HIS ONLY ANSWER.

"I HOPE EVERY BODY HAD A PLEASANT EVENING," SAID MR. WOODHOUSE, IN HIS
QUIET WAY. "I HAD. ONCE, I FELT THE FIRE RATHER TOO MUCH; BUT THEN I
MOVED BACK MY CHAIR A LITTLE, A VERY LITTLE, AND IT DID NOT DISTURB ME.
MISS BATES WAS VERY CHATTY AND GOOD-HUMOURED, AS SHE ALWAYS IS, THOUGH
SHE SPEAKS RATHER TOO QUICK. HOWEVER, SHE IS VERY AGREEABLE, AND MRS.
BATES TOO, IN A DIFFERENT WAY. I LIKE OLD FRIENDS; AND MISS JANE
FAIRFAX IS A VERY PRETTY SORT OF YOUNG LADY, A VERY PRETTY AND A
VERY WELL-BEHAVED YOUNG LADY INDEED. SHE MUST HAVE FOUND THE EVENING
AGREEABLE, MR. KNIGHTLEY, BECAUSE SHE HAD EMMA."

"TRUE, SIR; AND EMMA, BECAUSE SHE HAD MISS FAIRFAX."

EMMA SAW HIS ANXIETY, AND WISHING TO APPEASE IT, AT LEAST FOR THE
PRESENT, SAID, AND WITH A SINCERITY WHICH NO ONE COULD QUESTION--

"SHE IS A SORT OF ELEGANT CREATURE THAT ONE CANNOT KEEP ONE'S EYES FROM.
I AM ALWAYS WATCHING HER TO ADMIRE; AND I DO PITY HER FROM MY HEART."

MR. KNIGHTLEY LOOKED AS IF HE WERE MORE GRATIFIED THAN HE CARED TO
EXPRESS; AND BEFORE HE COULD MAKE ANY REPLY, MR. WOODHOUSE, WHOSE
THOUGHTS WERE ON THE BATES'S, SAID--

"IT IS A GREAT PITY THAT THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD BE SO CONFINED! A
GREAT PITY INDEED! AND I HAVE OFTEN WISHED--BUT IT IS SO LITTLE ONE CAN
VENTURE TO DO--SMALL, TRIFLING PRESENTS, OF ANY THING UNCOMMON--NOW WE
HAVE KILLED A PORKER, AND EMMA THINKS OF SENDING THEM A LOIN OR A LEG;
IT IS VERY SMALL AND DELICATE--HARTFIELD PORK IS NOT LIKE ANY OTHER
PORK--BUT STILL IT IS PORK--AND, MY DEAR EMMA, UNLESS ONE COULD BE SURE
OF THEIR MAKING IT INTO STEAKS, NICELY FRIED, AS OURS ARE FRIED, WITHOUT
THE SMALLEST GREASE, AND NOT ROAST IT, FOR NO STOMACH CAN BEAR ROAST
PORK--I THINK WE HAD BETTER SEND THE LEG--DO NOT YOU THINK SO, MY DEAR?"

"MY DEAR PAPA, I SENT THE WHOLE HIND-QUARTER. I KNEW YOU WOULD WISH IT.
THERE WILL BE THE LEG TO BE SALTED, YOU KNOW, WHICH IS SO VERY NICE, AND
THE LOIN TO BE DRESSED DIRECTLY IN ANY MANNER THEY LIKE."

"THAT'S RIGHT, MY DEAR, VERY RIGHT. I HAD NOT THOUGHT OF IT BEFORE, BUT
THAT IS THE BEST WAY. THEY MUST NOT OVER-SALT THE LEG; AND THEN, IF IT
IS NOT OVER-SALTED, AND IF IT IS VERY THOROUGHLY BOILED, JUST AS SERLE
BOILS OURS, AND EATEN VERY MODERATELY OF, WITH A BOILED TURNIP, AND A
LITTLE CARROT OR PARSNIP, I DO NOT CONSIDER IT UNWHOLESOME."

"EMMA," SAID MR. KNIGHTLEY PRESENTLY, "I HAVE A PIECE OF NEWS FOR YOU.
YOU LIKE NEWS--AND I HEARD AN ARTICLE IN MY WAY HITHER THAT I THINK WILL
INTEREST YOU."

"NEWS! OH! YES, I ALWAYS LIKE NEWS. WHAT IS IT?--WHY DO YOU SMILE
SO?--WHERE DID YOU HEAR IT?--AT RANDALLS?"

HE HAD TIME ONLY TO SAY,

"NO, NOT AT RANDALLS; I HAVE NOT BEEN NEAR RANDALLS," WHEN THE DOOR WAS
THROWN OPEN, AND MISS BATES AND MISS FAIRFAX WALKED INTO THE ROOM. FULL
OF THANKS, AND FULL OF NEWS, MISS BATES KNEW NOT WHICH TO GIVE QUICKEST.
MR. KNIGHTLEY SOON SAW THAT HE HAD LOST HIS MOMENT, AND THAT NOT ANOTHER
SYLLABLE OF COMMUNICATION COULD REST WITH HIM.

"OH! MY DEAR SIR, HOW ARE YOU THIS MORNING? MY DEAR MISS WOODHOUSE--I
COME QUITE OVER-POWERED. SUCH A BEAUTIFUL HIND-QUARTER OF PORK! YOU
ARE TOO BOUNTIFUL! HAVE YOU HEARD THE NEWS? MR. ELTON IS GOING TO BE
MARRIED."

EMMA HAD NOT HAD TIME EVEN TO THINK OF MR. ELTON, AND SHE WAS SO
COMPLETELY SURPRIZED THAT SHE COULD NOT AVOID A LITTLE START, AND A
LITTLE BLUSH, AT THE SOUND.

"THERE IS MY NEWS:--I THOUGHT IT WOULD INTEREST YOU," SAID MR.
KNIGHTLEY, WITH A SMILE WHICH IMPLIED A CONVICTION OF SOME PART OF WHAT
HAD PASSED BETWEEN THEM.

"BUT WHERE COULD YOU HEAR IT?" CRIED MISS BATES. "WHERE COULD YOU
POSSIBLY HEAR IT, MR. KNIGHTLEY? FOR IT IS NOT FIVE MINUTES SINCE I
RECEIVED MRS. COLE'S NOTE--NO, IT CANNOT BE MORE THAN FIVE--OR AT LEAST
TEN--FOR I HAD GOT MY BONNET AND SPENCER ON, JUST READY TO COME OUT--I
WAS ONLY GONE DOWN TO SPEAK TO PATTY AGAIN ABOUT THE PORK--JANE WAS
STANDING IN THE PASSAGE--WERE NOT YOU, JANE?--FOR MY MOTHER WAS SO
AFRAID THAT WE HAD NOT ANY SALTING-PAN LARGE ENOUGH. SO I SAID I WOULD
GO DOWN AND SEE, AND JANE SAID, 'SHALL I GO DOWN INSTEAD? FOR I THINK
YOU HAVE A LITTLE COLD, AND PATTY HAS BEEN WASHING THE KITCHEN.'--'OH!
MY DEAR,' SAID I--WELL, AND JUST THEN CAME THE NOTE. A MISS
HAWKINS--THAT'S ALL I KNOW. A MISS HAWKINS OF BATH. BUT, MR. KNIGHTLEY,
HOW COULD YOU POSSIBLY HAVE HEARD IT? FOR THE VERY MOMENT MR. COLE TOLD
MRS. COLE OF IT, SHE SAT DOWN AND WROTE TO ME. A MISS HAWKINS--"

"I WAS WITH MR. COLE ON BUSINESS AN HOUR AND A HALF AGO. HE HAD JUST
READ ELTON'S LETTER AS I WAS SHEWN IN, AND HANDED IT TO ME DIRECTLY."

"WELL! THAT IS QUITE--I SUPPOSE THERE NEVER WAS A PIECE OF NEWS MORE
GENERALLY INTERESTING. MY DEAR SIR, YOU REALLY ARE TOO BOUNTIFUL. MY
MOTHER DESIRES HER VERY BEST COMPLIMENTS AND REGARDS, AND A THOUSAND
THANKS, AND SAYS YOU REALLY QUITE OPPRESS HER."

"WE CONSIDER OUR HARTFIELD PORK," REPLIED MR. WOODHOUSE--"INDEED IT
CERTAINLY IS, SO VERY SUPERIOR TO ALL OTHER PORK, THAT EMMA AND I CANNOT
HAVE A GREATER PLEASURE THAN--"

"OH! MY DEAR SIR, AS MY MOTHER SAYS, OUR FRIENDS ARE ONLY TOO GOOD
TO US. IF EVER THERE WERE PEOPLE WHO, WITHOUT HAVING GREAT WEALTH
THEMSELVES, HAD EVERY THING THEY COULD WISH FOR, I AM SURE IT IS US.
WE MAY WELL SAY THAT 'OUR LOT IS CAST IN A GOODLY HERITAGE.' WELL, MR.
KNIGHTLEY, AND SO YOU ACTUALLY SAW THE LETTER; WELL--"

"IT WAS SHORT--MERELY TO ANNOUNCE--BUT CHEERFUL, EXULTING, OF COURSE."--
HERE WAS A SLY GLANCE AT EMMA. "HE HAD BEEN SO FORTUNATE AS TO--I FORGET
THE PRECISE WORDS--ONE HAS NO BUSINESS TO REMEMBER THEM. THE INFORMATION
WAS, AS YOU STATE, THAT HE WAS GOING TO BE MARRIED TO A MISS HAWKINS. BY
HIS STYLE, I SHOULD IMAGINE IT JUST SETTLED."

"MR. ELTON GOING TO BE MARRIED!" SAID EMMA, AS SOON AS SHE COULD SPEAK.
"HE WILL HAVE EVERY BODY'S WISHES FOR HIS HAPPINESS."

"HE IS VERY YOUNG TO SETTLE," WAS MR. WOODHOUSE'S OBSERVATION. "HE HAD
BETTER NOT BE IN A HURRY. HE SEEMED TO ME VERY WELL OFF AS HE WAS. WE
WERE ALWAYS GLAD TO SEE HIM AT HARTFIELD."

"A NEW NEIGHBOUR FOR US ALL, MISS WOODHOUSE!" SAID MISS BATES, JOYFULLY;
"MY MOTHER IS SO PLEASED!--SHE SAYS SHE CANNOT BEAR TO HAVE THE POOR OLD
VICARAGE WITHOUT A MISTRESS. THIS IS GREAT NEWS, INDEED. JANE, YOU HAVE
NEVER SEEN MR. ELTON!--NO WONDER THAT YOU HAVE SUCH A CURIOSITY TO SEE
HIM."

JANE'S CURIOSITY DID NOT APPEAR OF THAT ABSORBING NATURE AS WHOLLY TO
OCCUPY HER.

"NO--I HAVE NEVER SEEN MR. ELTON," SHE REPLIED, STARTING ON THIS APPEAL;
"IS HE--IS HE A TALL MAN?"

"WHO SHALL ANSWER THAT QUESTION?" CRIED EMMA. "MY FATHER WOULD SAY
'YES,' MR. KNIGHTLEY 'NO;' AND MISS BATES AND I THAT HE IS JUST THE
HAPPY MEDIUM. WHEN YOU HAVE BEEN HERE A LITTLE LONGER, MISS FAIRFAX,
YOU WILL UNDERSTAND THAT MR. ELTON IS THE STANDARD OF PERFECTION IN
HIGHBURY, BOTH IN PERSON AND MIND."

"VERY TRUE, MISS WOODHOUSE, SO SHE WILL. HE IS THE VERY BEST YOUNG
MAN--BUT, MY DEAR JANE, IF YOU REMEMBER, I TOLD YOU YESTERDAY HE
WAS PRECISELY THE HEIGHT OF MR. PERRY. MISS HAWKINS,--I DARE SAY, AN
EXCELLENT YOUNG WOMAN. HIS EXTREME ATTENTION TO MY MOTHER--WANTING
HER TO SIT IN THE VICARAGE PEW, THAT SHE MIGHT HEAR THE BETTER, FOR MY
MOTHER IS A LITTLE DEAF, YOU KNOW--IT IS NOT MUCH, BUT SHE DOES NOT
HEAR QUITE QUICK. JANE SAYS THAT COLONEL CAMPBELL IS A LITTLE DEAF. HE
FANCIED BATHING MIGHT BE GOOD FOR IT--THE WARM BATH--BUT SHE SAYS IT DID
HIM NO LASTING BENEFIT. COLONEL CAMPBELL, YOU KNOW, IS QUITE OUR ANGEL.
AND MR. DIXON SEEMS A VERY CHARMING YOUNG MAN, QUITE WORTHY OF HIM. IT
IS SUCH A HAPPINESS WHEN GOOD PEOPLE GET TOGETHER--AND THEY ALWAYS DO.
NOW, HERE WILL BE MR. ELTON AND MISS HAWKINS; AND THERE ARE THE COLES,
SUCH VERY GOOD PEOPLE; AND THE PERRYS--I SUPPOSE THERE NEVER WAS A
HAPPIER OR A BETTER COUPLE THAN MR. AND MRS. PERRY. I SAY, SIR," TURNING
TO MR. WOODHOUSE, "I THINK THERE ARE FEW PLACES WITH SUCH SOCIETY AS
HIGHBURY. I ALWAYS SAY, WE ARE QUITE BLESSED IN OUR NEIGHBOURS.--MY DEAR
SIR, IF THERE IS ONE THING MY MOTHER LOVES BETTER THAN ANOTHER, IT IS
PORK--A ROAST LOIN OF PORK--"

"AS TO WHO, OR WHAT MISS HAWKINS IS, OR HOW LONG HE HAS BEEN ACQUAINTED
WITH HER," SAID EMMA, "NOTHING I SUPPOSE CAN BE KNOWN. ONE FEELS THAT IT
CANNOT BE A VERY LONG ACQUAINTANCE. HE HAS BEEN GONE ONLY FOUR WEEKS."

NOBODY HAD ANY INFORMATION TO GIVE; AND, AFTER A FEW MORE WONDERINGS,
EMMA SAID,

"YOU ARE SILENT, MISS FAIRFAX--BUT I HOPE YOU MEAN TO TAKE AN INTEREST
IN THIS NEWS. YOU, WHO HAVE BEEN HEARING AND SEEING SO MUCH OF LATE
ON THESE SUBJECTS, WHO MUST HAVE BEEN SO DEEP IN THE BUSINESS ON MISS
CAMPBELL'S ACCOUNT--WE SHALL NOT EXCUSE YOUR BEING INDIFFERENT ABOUT MR.
ELTON AND MISS HAWKINS."

"WHEN I HAVE SEEN MR. ELTON," REPLIED JANE, "I DARE SAY I SHALL BE
INTERESTED--BUT I BELIEVE IT REQUIRES THAT WITH ME. AND AS IT IS SOME
MONTHS SINCE MISS CAMPBELL MARRIED, THE IMPRESSION MAY BE A LITTLE WORN
OFF."

"YES, HE HAS BEEN GONE JUST FOUR WEEKS, AS YOU OBSERVE, MISS WOODHOUSE,"
SAID MISS BATES, "FOUR WEEKS YESTERDAY.--A MISS HAWKINS!--WELL, I HAD
ALWAYS RATHER FANCIED IT WOULD BE SOME YOUNG LADY HEREABOUTS; NOT THAT
I EVER--MRS. COLE ONCE WHISPERED TO ME--BUT I IMMEDIATELY SAID, 'NO, MR.
ELTON IS A MOST WORTHY YOUNG MAN--BUT'--IN SHORT, I DO NOT THINK I AM
PARTICULARLY QUICK AT THOSE SORT OF DISCOVERIES. I DO NOT PRETEND TO IT.
WHAT IS BEFORE ME, I SEE. AT THE SAME TIME, NOBODY COULD WONDER IF
MR. ELTON SHOULD HAVE ASPIRED--MISS WOODHOUSE LETS ME CHATTER ON, SO
GOOD-HUMOUREDLY. SHE KNOWS I WOULD NOT OFFEND FOR THE WORLD. HOW DOES
MISS SMITH DO? SHE SEEMS QUITE RECOVERED NOW. HAVE YOU HEARD FROM MRS.
JOHN KNIGHTLEY LATELY? OH! THOSE DEAR LITTLE CHILDREN. JANE, DO YOU
KNOW I ALWAYS FANCY MR. DIXON LIKE MR. JOHN KNIGHTLEY. I MEAN IN
PERSON--TALL, AND WITH THAT SORT OF LOOK--AND NOT VERY TALKATIVE."

"QUITE WRONG, MY DEAR AUNT; THERE IS NO LIKENESS AT ALL."

"VERY ODD! BUT ONE NEVER DOES FORM A JUST IDEA OF ANY BODY BEFOREHAND.
ONE TAKES UP A NOTION, AND RUNS AWAY WITH IT. MR. DIXON, YOU SAY, IS
NOT, STRICTLY SPEAKING, HANDSOME?"

"HANDSOME! OH! NO--FAR FROM IT--CERTAINLY PLAIN. I TOLD YOU HE WAS
PLAIN."

"MY DEAR, YOU SAID THAT MISS CAMPBELL WOULD NOT ALLOW HIM TO BE PLAIN,
AND THAT YOU YOURSELF--"

"OH! AS FOR ME, MY JUDGMENT IS WORTH NOTHING. WHERE I HAVE A REGARD,
I ALWAYS THINK A PERSON WELL-LOOKING. BUT I GAVE WHAT I BELIEVED THE
GENERAL OPINION, WHEN I CALLED HIM PLAIN."

"WELL, MY DEAR JANE, I BELIEVE WE MUST BE RUNNING AWAY. THE WEATHER DOES
NOT LOOK WELL, AND GRANDMAMA WILL BE UNEASY. YOU ARE TOO OBLIGING, MY
DEAR MISS WOODHOUSE; BUT WE REALLY MUST TAKE LEAVE. THIS HAS BEEN A MOST
AGREEABLE PIECE OF NEWS INDEED. I SHALL JUST GO ROUND BY MRS. COLE'S;
BUT I SHALL NOT STOP THREE MINUTES: AND, JANE, YOU HAD BETTER GO HOME
DIRECTLY--I WOULD NOT HAVE YOU OUT IN A SHOWER!--WE THINK SHE IS THE
BETTER FOR HIGHBURY ALREADY. THANK YOU, WE DO INDEED. I SHALL NOT
ATTEMPT CALLING ON MRS. GODDARD, FOR I REALLY DO NOT THINK SHE CARES FOR
ANY THING BUT BOILED PORK: WHEN WE DRESS THE LEG IT WILL BE ANOTHER
THING. GOOD MORNING TO YOU, MY DEAR SIR. OH! MR. KNIGHTLEY IS COMING
TOO. WELL, THAT IS SO VERY!--I AM SURE IF JANE IS TIRED, YOU WILL BE
SO KIND AS TO GIVE HER YOUR ARM.--MR. ELTON, AND MISS HAWKINS!--GOOD
MORNING TO YOU."

EMMA, ALONE WITH HER FATHER, HAD HALF HER ATTENTION WANTED BY HIM WHILE
HE LAMENTED THAT YOUNG PEOPLE WOULD BE IN SUCH A HURRY TO MARRY--AND TO
MARRY STRANGERS TOO--AND THE OTHER HALF SHE COULD GIVE TO HER OWN VIEW
OF THE SUBJECT. IT WAS TO HERSELF AN AMUSING AND A VERY WELCOME PIECE
OF NEWS, AS PROVING THAT MR. ELTON COULD NOT HAVE SUFFERED LONG; BUT SHE
WAS SORRY FOR HARRIET: HARRIET MUST FEEL IT--AND ALL THAT SHE COULD HOPE
WAS, BY GIVING THE FIRST INFORMATION HERSELF, TO SAVE HER FROM HEARING
IT ABRUPTLY FROM OTHERS. IT WAS NOW ABOUT THE TIME THAT SHE WAS LIKELY
TO CALL. IF SHE WERE TO MEET MISS BATES IN HER WAY!--AND UPON ITS
BEGINNING TO RAIN, EMMA WAS OBLIGED TO EXPECT THAT THE WEATHER WOULD
BE DETAINING HER AT MRS. GODDARD'S, AND THAT THE INTELLIGENCE WOULD
UNDOUBTEDLY RUSH UPON HER WITHOUT PREPARATION.

THE SHOWER WAS HEAVY, BUT SHORT; AND IT HAD NOT BEEN OVER FIVE MINUTES,
WHEN IN CAME HARRIET, WITH JUST THE HEATED, AGITATED LOOK WHICH
HURRYING THITHER WITH A FULL HEART WAS LIKELY TO GIVE; AND THE "OH! MISS
WOODHOUSE, WHAT DO YOU THINK HAS HAPPENED!" WHICH INSTANTLY BURST FORTH,
HAD ALL THE EVIDENCE OF CORRESPONDING PERTURBATION. AS THE BLOW WAS
GIVEN, EMMA FELT THAT SHE COULD NOT NOW SHEW GREATER KINDNESS THAN IN
LISTENING; AND HARRIET, UNCHECKED, RAN EAGERLY THROUGH WHAT SHE HAD TO
TELL. "SHE HAD SET OUT FROM MRS. GODDARD'S HALF AN HOUR AGO--SHE HAD
BEEN AFRAID IT WOULD RAIN--SHE HAD BEEN AFRAID IT WOULD POUR DOWN
EVERY MOMENT--BUT SHE THOUGHT SHE MIGHT GET TO HARTFIELD FIRST--SHE
HAD HURRIED ON AS FAST AS POSSIBLE; BUT THEN, AS SHE WAS PASSING BY THE
HOUSE WHERE A YOUNG WOMAN WAS MAKING UP A GOWN FOR HER, SHE THOUGHT SHE
WOULD JUST STEP IN AND SEE HOW IT WENT ON; AND THOUGH SHE DID NOT SEEM
TO STAY HALF A MOMENT THERE, SOON AFTER SHE CAME OUT IT BEGAN TO RAIN,
AND SHE DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO; SO SHE RAN ON DIRECTLY, AS FAST AS
SHE COULD, AND TOOK SHELTER AT FORD'S."--FORD'S WAS THE PRINCIPAL
WOOLLEN-DRAPER, LINEN-DRAPER, AND HABERDASHER'S SHOP UNITED; THE SHOP
FIRST IN SIZE AND FASHION IN THE PLACE.--"AND SO, THERE SHE HAD
SET, WITHOUT AN IDEA OF ANY THING IN THE WORLD, FULL TEN MINUTES,
PERHAPS--WHEN, ALL OF A SUDDEN, WHO SHOULD COME IN--TO BE SURE IT WAS
SO VERY ODD!--BUT THEY ALWAYS DEALT AT FORD'S--WHO SHOULD COME IN, BUT
ELIZABETH MARTIN AND HER BROTHER!--DEAR MISS WOODHOUSE! ONLY THINK. I
THOUGHT I SHOULD HAVE FAINTED. I DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO. I WAS SITTING
NEAR THE DOOR--ELIZABETH SAW ME DIRECTLY; BUT HE DID NOT; HE WAS BUSY
WITH THE UMBRELLA. I AM SURE SHE SAW ME, BUT SHE LOOKED AWAY DIRECTLY,
AND TOOK NO NOTICE; AND THEY BOTH WENT TO QUITE THE FARTHER END OF THE
SHOP; AND I KEPT SITTING NEAR THE DOOR!--OH! DEAR; I WAS SO MISERABLE!
I AM SURE I MUST HAVE BEEN AS WHITE AS MY GOWN. I COULD NOT GO AWAY
YOU KNOW, BECAUSE OF THE RAIN; BUT I DID SO WISH MYSELF ANYWHERE IN THE
WORLD BUT THERE.--OH! DEAR, MISS WOODHOUSE--WELL, AT LAST, I FANCY, HE
LOOKED ROUND AND SAW ME; FOR INSTEAD OF GOING ON WITH HER BUYINGS, THEY
BEGAN WHISPERING TO ONE ANOTHER. I AM SURE THEY WERE TALKING OF ME; AND
I COULD NOT HELP THINKING THAT HE WAS PERSUADING HER TO SPEAK TO ME--(DO
YOU THINK HE WAS, MISS WOODHOUSE?)--FOR PRESENTLY SHE CAME FORWARD--CAME
QUITE UP TO ME, AND ASKED ME HOW I DID, AND SEEMED READY TO SHAKE HANDS,
IF I WOULD. SHE DID NOT DO ANY OF IT IN THE SAME WAY THAT SHE USED; I
COULD SEE SHE WAS ALTERED; BUT, HOWEVER, SHE SEEMED TO TRY TO BE VERY
FRIENDLY, AND WE SHOOK HANDS, AND STOOD TALKING SOME TIME; BUT I KNOW NO
MORE WHAT I SAID--I WAS IN SUCH A TREMBLE!--I REMEMBER SHE SAID SHE
WAS SORRY WE NEVER MET NOW; WHICH I THOUGHT ALMOST TOO KIND! DEAR, MISS
WOODHOUSE, I WAS ABSOLUTELY MISERABLE! BY THAT TIME, IT WAS BEGINNING TO
HOLD UP, AND I WAS DETERMINED THAT NOTHING SHOULD STOP ME FROM GETTING
AWAY--AND THEN--ONLY THINK!--I FOUND HE WAS COMING UP TOWARDS ME
TOO--SLOWLY YOU KNOW, AND AS IF HE DID NOT QUITE KNOW WHAT TO DO; AND
SO HE CAME AND SPOKE, AND I ANSWERED--AND I STOOD FOR A MINUTE, FEELING
DREADFULLY, YOU KNOW, ONE CAN'T TELL HOW; AND THEN I TOOK COURAGE, AND
SAID IT DID NOT RAIN, AND I MUST GO; AND SO OFF I SET; AND I HAD NOT GOT
THREE YARDS FROM THE DOOR, WHEN HE CAME AFTER ME, ONLY TO SAY, IF I WAS
GOING TO HARTFIELD, HE THOUGHT I HAD MUCH BETTER GO ROUND BY MR. COLE'S
STABLES, FOR I SHOULD FIND THE NEAR WAY QUITE FLOATED BY THIS RAIN. OH!
DEAR, I THOUGHT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE DEATH OF ME! SO I SAID, I WAS
VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO HIM: YOU KNOW I COULD NOT DO LESS; AND THEN HE WENT
BACK TO ELIZABETH, AND I CAME ROUND BY THE STABLES--I BELIEVE I DID--BUT
I HARDLY KNEW WHERE I WAS, OR ANY THING ABOUT IT. OH! MISS WOODHOUSE,
I WOULD RATHER DONE ANY THING THAN HAVE IT HAPPEN: AND YET, YOU KNOW,
THERE WAS A SORT OF SATISFACTION IN SEEING HIM BEHAVE SO PLEASANTLY AND
SO KINDLY. AND ELIZABETH, TOO. OH! MISS WOODHOUSE, DO TALK TO ME AND
MAKE ME COMFORTABLE AGAIN."

VERY SINCERELY DID EMMA WISH TO DO SO; BUT IT WAS NOT IMMEDIATELY IN
HER POWER. SHE WAS OBLIGED TO STOP AND THINK. SHE WAS NOT THOROUGHLY
COMFORTABLE HERSELF. THE YOUNG MAN'S CONDUCT, AND HIS SISTER'S, SEEMED
THE RESULT OF REAL FEELING, AND SHE COULD NOT BUT PITY THEM. AS HARRIET
DESCRIBED IT, THERE HAD BEEN AN INTERESTING MIXTURE OF WOUNDED AFFECTION
AND GENUINE DELICACY IN THEIR BEHAVIOUR. BUT SHE HAD BELIEVED THEM TO BE
WELL-MEANING, WORTHY PEOPLE BEFORE; AND WHAT DIFFERENCE DID THIS MAKE
IN THE EVILS OF THE CONNEXION? IT WAS FOLLY TO BE DISTURBED BY IT. OF
COURSE, HE MUST BE SORRY TO LOSE HER--THEY MUST BE ALL SORRY. AMBITION,
AS WELL AS LOVE, HAD PROBABLY BEEN MORTIFIED. THEY MIGHT ALL HAVE HOPED
TO RISE BY HARRIET'S ACQUAINTANCE: AND BESIDES, WHAT WAS THE VALUE OF
HARRIET'S DESCRIPTION?--SO EASILY PLEASED--SO LITTLE DISCERNING;--WHAT
SIGNIFIED HER PRAISE?

SHE EXERTED HERSELF, AND DID TRY TO MAKE HER COMFORTABLE, BY CONSIDERING
ALL THAT HAD PASSED AS A MERE TRIFLE, AND QUITE UNWORTHY OF BEING DWELT
ON,

"IT MIGHT BE DISTRESSING, FOR THE MOMENT," SAID SHE; "BUT YOU SEEM TO
HAVE BEHAVED EXTREMELY WELL; AND IT IS OVER--AND MAY NEVER--CAN NEVER,
AS A FIRST MEETING, OCCUR AGAIN, AND THEREFORE YOU NEED NOT THINK ABOUT
IT."

HARRIET SAID, "VERY TRUE," AND SHE "WOULD NOT THINK ABOUT IT;" BUT STILL
SHE TALKED OF IT--STILL SHE COULD TALK OF NOTHING ELSE; AND EMMA, AT
LAST, IN ORDER TO PUT THE MARTINS OUT OF HER HEAD, WAS OBLIGED TO HURRY
ON THE NEWS, WHICH SHE HAD MEANT TO GIVE WITH SO MUCH TENDER CAUTION;
HARDLY KNOWING HERSELF WHETHER TO REJOICE OR BE ANGRY, ASHAMED OR ONLY
AMUSED, AT SUCH A STATE OF MIND IN POOR HARRIET--SUCH A CONCLUSION OF
MR. ELTON'S IMPORTANCE WITH HER!

MR. ELTON'S RIGHTS, HOWEVER, GRADUALLY REVIVED. THOUGH SHE DID NOT FEEL
THE FIRST INTELLIGENCE AS SHE MIGHT HAVE DONE THE DAY BEFORE, OR AN HOUR
BEFORE, ITS INTEREST SOON INCREASED; AND BEFORE THEIR FIRST CONVERSATION
WAS OVER, SHE HAD TALKED HERSELF INTO ALL THE SENSATIONS OF CURIOSITY,
WONDER AND REGRET, PAIN AND PLEASURE, AS TO THIS FORTUNATE MISS HAWKINS,
WHICH COULD CONDUCE TO PLACE THE MARTINS UNDER PROPER SUBORDINATION IN
HER FANCY.

EMMA LEARNED TO BE RATHER GLAD THAT THERE HAD BEEN SUCH A MEETING. IT
HAD BEEN SERVICEABLE IN DEADENING THE FIRST SHOCK, WITHOUT RETAINING ANY
INFLUENCE TO ALARM. AS HARRIET NOW LIVED, THE MARTINS COULD NOT GET
AT HER, WITHOUT SEEKING HER, WHERE HITHERTO THEY HAD WANTED EITHER THE
COURAGE OR THE CONDESCENSION TO SEEK HER; FOR SINCE HER REFUSAL OF THE
BROTHER, THE SISTERS NEVER HAD BEEN AT MRS. GODDARD'S; AND A TWELVEMONTH
MIGHT PASS WITHOUT THEIR BEING THROWN TOGETHER AGAIN, WITH ANY
NECESSITY, OR EVEN ANY POWER OF SPEECH.



CHAPTER IV


HUMAN NATURE IS SO WELL DISPOSED TOWARDS THOSE WHO ARE IN INTERESTING
SITUATIONS, THAT A YOUNG PERSON, WHO EITHER MARRIES OR DIES, IS SURE OF
BEING KINDLY SPOKEN OF.

A WEEK HAD NOT PASSED SINCE MISS HAWKINS'S NAME WAS FIRST MENTIONED IN
HIGHBURY, BEFORE SHE WAS, BY SOME MEANS OR OTHER, DISCOVERED TO HAVE
EVERY RECOMMENDATION OF PERSON AND MIND; TO BE HANDSOME, ELEGANT, HIGHLY
ACCOMPLISHED, AND PERFECTLY AMIABLE: AND WHEN MR. ELTON HIMSELF ARRIVED
TO TRIUMPH IN HIS HAPPY PROSPECTS, AND CIRCULATE THE FAME OF HER MERITS,
THERE WAS VERY LITTLE MORE FOR HIM TO DO, THAN TO TELL HER CHRISTIAN
NAME, AND SAY WHOSE MUSIC SHE PRINCIPALLY PLAYED.

MR. ELTON RETURNED, A VERY HAPPY MAN. HE HAD GONE AWAY REJECTED AND
MORTIFIED--DISAPPOINTED IN A VERY SANGUINE HOPE, AFTER A SERIES OF WHAT
APPEARED TO HIM STRONG ENCOURAGEMENT; AND NOT ONLY LOSING THE RIGHT
LADY, BUT FINDING HIMSELF DEBASED TO THE LEVEL OF A VERY WRONG ONE. HE
HAD GONE AWAY DEEPLY OFFENDED--HE CAME BACK ENGAGED TO ANOTHER--AND
TO ANOTHER AS SUPERIOR, OF COURSE, TO THE FIRST, AS UNDER SUCH
CIRCUMSTANCES WHAT IS GAINED ALWAYS IS TO WHAT IS LOST. HE CAME BACK GAY
AND SELF-SATISFIED, EAGER AND BUSY, CARING NOTHING FOR MISS WOODHOUSE,
AND DEFYING MISS SMITH.

THE CHARMING AUGUSTA HAWKINS, IN ADDITION TO ALL THE USUAL ADVANTAGES OF
PERFECT BEAUTY AND MERIT, WAS IN POSSESSION OF AN INDEPENDENT FORTUNE,
OF SO MANY THOUSANDS AS WOULD ALWAYS BE CALLED TEN; A POINT OF SOME
DIGNITY, AS WELL AS SOME CONVENIENCE: THE STORY TOLD WELL; HE HAD NOT
THROWN HIMSELF AWAY--HE HAD GAINED A WOMAN OF 10,000 L. OR THEREABOUTS;
AND HE HAD GAINED HER WITH SUCH DELIGHTFUL RAPIDITY--THE FIRST HOUR OF
INTRODUCTION HAD BEEN SO VERY SOON FOLLOWED BY DISTINGUISHING NOTICE;
THE HISTORY WHICH HE HAD TO GIVE MRS. COLE OF THE RISE AND PROGRESS
OF THE AFFAIR WAS SO GLORIOUS--THE STEPS SO QUICK, FROM THE ACCIDENTAL
RENCONTRE, TO THE DINNER AT MR. GREEN'S, AND THE PARTY AT MRS.
BROWN'S--SMILES AND BLUSHES RISING IN IMPORTANCE--WITH CONSCIOUSNESS AND
AGITATION RICHLY SCATTERED--THE LADY HAD BEEN SO EASILY IMPRESSED--SO
SWEETLY DISPOSED--HAD IN SHORT, TO USE A MOST INTELLIGIBLE PHRASE,
BEEN SO VERY READY TO HAVE HIM, THAT VANITY AND PRUDENCE WERE EQUALLY
CONTENTED.

HE HAD CAUGHT BOTH SUBSTANCE AND SHADOW--BOTH FORTUNE AND AFFECTION, AND
WAS JUST THE HAPPY MAN HE OUGHT TO BE; TALKING ONLY OF HIMSELF AND
HIS OWN CONCERNS--EXPECTING TO BE CONGRATULATED--READY TO BE LAUGHED
AT--AND, WITH CORDIAL, FEARLESS SMILES, NOW ADDRESSING ALL THE YOUNG
LADIES OF THE PLACE, TO WHOM, A FEW WEEKS AGO, HE WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE
CAUTIOUSLY GALLANT.

THE WEDDING WAS NO DISTANT EVENT, AS THE PARTIES HAD ONLY THEMSELVES TO
PLEASE, AND NOTHING BUT THE NECESSARY PREPARATIONS TO WAIT FOR; AND
WHEN HE SET OUT FOR BATH AGAIN, THERE WAS A GENERAL EXPECTATION, WHICH
A CERTAIN GLANCE OF MRS. COLE'S DID NOT SEEM TO CONTRADICT, THAT WHEN HE
NEXT ENTERED HIGHBURY HE WOULD BRING HIS BRIDE.

DURING HIS PRESENT SHORT STAY, EMMA HAD BARELY SEEN HIM; BUT JUST ENOUGH
TO FEEL THAT THE FIRST MEETING WAS OVER, AND TO GIVE HER THE IMPRESSION
OF HIS NOT BEING IMPROVED BY THE MIXTURE OF PIQUE AND PRETENSION, NOW
SPREAD OVER HIS AIR. SHE WAS, IN FACT, BEGINNING VERY MUCH TO WONDER
THAT SHE HAD EVER THOUGHT HIM PLEASING AT ALL; AND HIS SIGHT WAS SO
INSEPARABLY CONNECTED WITH SOME VERY DISAGREEABLE FEELINGS, THAT,
EXCEPT IN A MORAL LIGHT, AS A PENANCE, A LESSON, A SOURCE OF PROFITABLE
HUMILIATION TO HER OWN MIND, SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN THANKFUL TO BE ASSURED
OF NEVER SEEING HIM AGAIN. SHE WISHED HIM VERY WELL; BUT HE GAVE
HER PAIN, AND HIS WELFARE TWENTY MILES OFF WOULD ADMINISTER MOST
SATISFACTION.

THE PAIN OF HIS CONTINUED RESIDENCE IN HIGHBURY, HOWEVER, MUST
CERTAINLY BE LESSENED BY HIS MARRIAGE. MANY VAIN SOLICITUDES WOULD BE
PREVENTED--MANY AWKWARDNESSES SMOOTHED BY IT. A MRS. ELTON WOULD
BE AN EXCUSE FOR ANY CHANGE OF INTERCOURSE; FORMER INTIMACY MIGHT SINK
WITHOUT REMARK. IT WOULD BE ALMOST BEGINNING THEIR LIFE OF CIVILITY
AGAIN.

OF THE LADY, INDIVIDUALLY, EMMA THOUGHT VERY LITTLE. SHE WAS GOOD ENOUGH
FOR MR. ELTON, NO DOUBT; ACCOMPLISHED ENOUGH FOR HIGHBURY--HANDSOME
ENOUGH--TO LOOK PLAIN, PROBABLY, BY HARRIET'S SIDE. AS TO CONNEXION,
THERE EMMA WAS PERFECTLY EASY; PERSUADED, THAT AFTER ALL HIS OWN VAUNTED
CLAIMS AND DISDAIN OF HARRIET, HE HAD DONE NOTHING. ON THAT ARTICLE,
TRUTH SEEMED ATTAINABLE. WHAT SHE WAS, MUST BE UNCERTAIN; BUT WHO
SHE WAS, MIGHT BE FOUND OUT; AND SETTING ASIDE THE 10,000 L., IT DID NOT
APPEAR THAT SHE WAS AT ALL HARRIET'S SUPERIOR. SHE BROUGHT NO NAME, NO
BLOOD, NO ALLIANCE. MISS HAWKINS WAS THE YOUNGEST OF THE TWO DAUGHTERS
OF A BRISTOL--MERCHANT, OF COURSE, HE MUST BE CALLED; BUT, AS THE WHOLE
OF THE PROFITS OF HIS MERCANTILE LIFE APPEARED SO VERY MODERATE, IT
WAS NOT UNFAIR TO GUESS THE DIGNITY OF HIS LINE OF TRADE HAD BEEN VERY
MODERATE ALSO. PART OF EVERY WINTER SHE HAD BEEN USED TO SPEND IN BATH;
BUT BRISTOL WAS HER HOME, THE VERY HEART OF BRISTOL; FOR THOUGH THE
FATHER AND MOTHER HAD DIED SOME YEARS AGO, AN UNCLE REMAINED--IN THE LAW
LINE--NOTHING MORE DISTINCTLY HONOURABLE WAS HAZARDED OF HIM, THAN
THAT HE WAS IN THE LAW LINE; AND WITH HIM THE DAUGHTER HAD LIVED. EMMA
GUESSED HIM TO BE THE DRUDGE OF SOME ATTORNEY, AND TOO STUPID TO RISE.
AND ALL THE GRANDEUR OF THE CONNEXION SEEMED DEPENDENT ON THE ELDER
SISTER, WHO WAS VERY WELL MARRIED, TO A GENTLEMAN IN A GREAT
WAY, NEAR BRISTOL, WHO KEPT TWO CARRIAGES! THAT WAS THE WIND-UP OF THE
HISTORY; THAT WAS THE GLORY OF MISS HAWKINS.

COULD SHE BUT HAVE GIVEN HARRIET HER FEELINGS ABOUT IT ALL! SHE HAD
TALKED HER INTO LOVE; BUT, ALAS! SHE WAS NOT SO EASILY TO BE TALKED OUT
OF IT. THE CHARM OF AN OBJECT TO OCCUPY THE MANY VACANCIES OF HARRIET'S
MIND WAS NOT TO BE TALKED AWAY. HE MIGHT BE SUPERSEDED BY ANOTHER; HE
CERTAINLY WOULD INDEED; NOTHING COULD BE CLEARER; EVEN A ROBERT MARTIN
WOULD HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENT; BUT NOTHING ELSE, SHE FEARED, WOULD CURE
HER. HARRIET WAS ONE OF THOSE, WHO, HAVING ONCE BEGUN, WOULD BE ALWAYS
IN LOVE. AND NOW, POOR GIRL! SHE WAS CONSIDERABLY WORSE FROM THIS
REAPPEARANCE OF MR. ELTON. SHE WAS ALWAYS HAVING A GLIMPSE OF HIM
SOMEWHERE OR OTHER. EMMA SAW HIM ONLY ONCE; BUT TWO OR THREE TIMES EVERY
DAY HARRIET WAS SURE JUST TO MEET WITH HIM, OR JUST TO MISS HIM,
JUST TO HEAR HIS VOICE, OR SEE HIS SHOULDER, JUST TO HAVE SOMETHING
OCCUR TO PRESERVE HIM IN HER FANCY, IN ALL THE FAVOURING WARMTH OF
SURPRIZE AND CONJECTURE. SHE WAS, MOREOVER, PERPETUALLY HEARING ABOUT
HIM; FOR, EXCEPTING WHEN AT HARTFIELD, SHE WAS ALWAYS AMONG THOSE WHO
SAW NO FAULT IN MR. ELTON, AND FOUND NOTHING SO INTERESTING AS
THE DISCUSSION OF HIS CONCERNS; AND EVERY REPORT, THEREFORE, EVERY
GUESS--ALL THAT HAD ALREADY OCCURRED, ALL THAT MIGHT OCCUR IN THE
ARRANGEMENT OF HIS AFFAIRS, COMPREHENDING INCOME, SERVANTS, AND
FURNITURE, WAS CONTINUALLY IN AGITATION AROUND HER. HER REGARD WAS
RECEIVING STRENGTH BY INVARIABLE PRAISE OF HIM, AND HER REGRETS KEPT
ALIVE, AND FEELINGS IRRITATED BY CEASELESS REPETITIONS OF MISS
HAWKINS'S HAPPINESS, AND CONTINUAL OBSERVATION OF, HOW MUCH HE SEEMED
ATTACHED!--HIS AIR AS HE WALKED BY THE HOUSE--THE VERY SITTING OF HIS
HAT, BEING ALL IN PROOF OF HOW MUCH HE WAS IN LOVE!

HAD IT BEEN ALLOWABLE ENTERTAINMENT, HAD THERE BEEN NO PAIN TO HER
FRIEND, OR REPROACH TO HERSELF, IN THE WAVERINGS OF HARRIET'S MIND,
EMMA WOULD HAVE BEEN AMUSED BY ITS VARIATIONS. SOMETIMES MR. ELTON
PREDOMINATED, SOMETIMES THE MARTINS; AND EACH WAS OCCASIONALLY USEFUL
AS A CHECK TO THE OTHER. MR. ELTON'S ENGAGEMENT HAD BEEN THE CURE OF
THE AGITATION OF MEETING MR. MARTIN. THE UNHAPPINESS PRODUCED BY THE
KNOWLEDGE OF THAT ENGAGEMENT HAD BEEN A LITTLE PUT ASIDE BY ELIZABETH
MARTIN'S CALLING AT MRS. GODDARD'S A FEW DAYS AFTERWARDS. HARRIET HAD
NOT BEEN AT HOME; BUT A NOTE HAD BEEN PREPARED AND LEFT FOR HER, WRITTEN
IN THE VERY STYLE TO TOUCH; A SMALL MIXTURE OF REPROACH, WITH A GREAT
DEAL OF KINDNESS; AND TILL MR. ELTON HIMSELF APPEARED, SHE HAD BEEN MUCH
OCCUPIED BY IT, CONTINUALLY PONDERING OVER WHAT COULD BE DONE IN RETURN,
AND WISHING TO DO MORE THAN SHE DARED TO CONFESS. BUT MR. ELTON, IN
PERSON, HAD DRIVEN AWAY ALL SUCH CARES. WHILE HE STAID, THE MARTINS WERE
FORGOTTEN; AND ON THE VERY MORNING OF HIS SETTING OFF FOR BATH AGAIN,
EMMA, TO DISSIPATE SOME OF THE DISTRESS IT OCCASIONED, JUDGED IT BEST
FOR HER TO RETURN ELIZABETH MARTIN'S VISIT.

HOW THAT VISIT WAS TO BE ACKNOWLEDGED--WHAT WOULD BE NECESSARY--AND
WHAT MIGHT BE SAFEST, HAD BEEN A POINT OF SOME DOUBTFUL CONSIDERATION.
ABSOLUTE NEGLECT OF THE MOTHER AND SISTERS, WHEN INVITED TO COME, WOULD
BE INGRATITUDE. IT MUST NOT BE: AND YET THE DANGER OF A RENEWAL OF THE
ACQUAINTANCE--!

AFTER MUCH THINKING, SHE COULD DETERMINE ON NOTHING BETTER, THAN
HARRIET'S RETURNING THE VISIT; BUT IN A WAY THAT, IF THEY HAD
UNDERSTANDING, SHOULD CONVINCE THEM THAT IT WAS TO BE ONLY A FORMAL
ACQUAINTANCE. SHE MEANT TO TAKE HER IN THE CARRIAGE, LEAVE HER AT THE
ABBEY MILL, WHILE SHE DROVE A LITTLE FARTHER, AND CALL FOR HER AGAIN
SO SOON, AS TO ALLOW NO TIME FOR INSIDIOUS APPLICATIONS OR DANGEROUS
RECURRENCES TO THE PAST, AND GIVE THE MOST DECIDED PROOF OF WHAT DEGREE
OF INTIMACY WAS CHOSEN FOR THE FUTURE.

SHE COULD THINK OF NOTHING BETTER: AND THOUGH THERE WAS SOMETHING IN IT
WHICH HER OWN HEART COULD NOT APPROVE--SOMETHING OF INGRATITUDE, MERELY
GLOSSED OVER--IT MUST BE DONE, OR WHAT WOULD BECOME OF HARRIET?



CHAPTER V


SMALL HEART HAD HARRIET FOR VISITING. ONLY HALF AN HOUR BEFORE HER
FRIEND CALLED FOR HER AT MRS. GODDARD'S, HER EVIL STARS HAD LED HER
TO THE VERY SPOT WHERE, AT THAT MOMENT, A TRUNK, DIRECTED TO THE REV.
PHILIP ELTON, WHITE-HART, BATH, WAS TO BE SEEN UNDER THE OPERATION OF
BEING LIFTED INTO THE BUTCHER'S CART, WHICH WAS TO CONVEY IT TO WHERE
THE COACHES PAST; AND EVERY THING IN THIS WORLD, EXCEPTING THAT TRUNK
AND THE DIRECTION, WAS CONSEQUENTLY A BLANK.

SHE WENT, HOWEVER; AND WHEN THEY REACHED THE FARM, AND SHE WAS TO BE
PUT DOWN, AT THE END OF THE BROAD, NEAT GRAVEL WALK, WHICH LED BETWEEN
ESPALIER APPLE-TREES TO THE FRONT DOOR, THE SIGHT OF EVERY THING WHICH
HAD GIVEN HER SO MUCH PLEASURE THE AUTUMN BEFORE, WAS BEGINNING TO
REVIVE A LITTLE LOCAL AGITATION; AND WHEN THEY PARTED, EMMA OBSERVED HER
TO BE LOOKING AROUND WITH A SORT OF FEARFUL CURIOSITY, WHICH DETERMINED
HER NOT TO ALLOW THE VISIT TO EXCEED THE PROPOSED QUARTER OF AN HOUR.
SHE WENT ON HERSELF, TO GIVE THAT PORTION OF TIME TO AN OLD SERVANT WHO
WAS MARRIED, AND SETTLED IN DONWELL.

THE QUARTER OF AN HOUR BROUGHT HER PUNCTUALLY TO THE WHITE GATE AGAIN;
AND MISS SMITH RECEIVING HER SUMMONS, WAS WITH HER WITHOUT DELAY, AND
UNATTENDED BY ANY ALARMING YOUNG MAN. SHE CAME SOLITARILY DOWN THE
GRAVEL WALK--A MISS MARTIN JUST APPEARING AT THE DOOR, AND PARTING WITH
HER SEEMINGLY WITH CEREMONIOUS CIVILITY.

HARRIET COULD NOT VERY SOON GIVE AN INTELLIGIBLE ACCOUNT. SHE WAS
FEELING TOO MUCH; BUT AT LAST EMMA COLLECTED FROM HER ENOUGH TO
UNDERSTAND THE SORT OF MEETING, AND THE SORT OF PAIN IT WAS CREATING.
SHE HAD SEEN ONLY MRS. MARTIN AND THE TWO GIRLS. THEY HAD RECEIVED HER
DOUBTINGLY, IF NOT COOLLY; AND NOTHING BEYOND THE MEREST COMMONPLACE HAD
BEEN TALKED ALMOST ALL THE TIME--TILL JUST AT LAST, WHEN MRS. MARTIN'S
SAYING, ALL OF A SUDDEN, THAT SHE THOUGHT MISS SMITH WAS GROWN, HAD
BROUGHT ON A MORE INTERESTING SUBJECT, AND A WARMER MANNER. IN THAT VERY
ROOM SHE HAD BEEN MEASURED LAST SEPTEMBER, WITH HER TWO FRIENDS. THERE
WERE THE PENCILLED MARKS AND MEMORANDUMS ON THE WAINSCOT BY THE WINDOW.
HE HAD DONE IT. THEY ALL SEEMED TO REMEMBER THE DAY, THE HOUR,
THE PARTY, THE OCCASION--TO FEEL THE SAME CONSCIOUSNESS, THE SAME
REGRETS--TO BE READY TO RETURN TO THE SAME GOOD UNDERSTANDING; AND THEY
WERE JUST GROWING AGAIN LIKE THEMSELVES, (HARRIET, AS EMMA MUST SUSPECT,
AS READY AS THE BEST OF THEM TO BE CORDIAL AND HAPPY,) WHEN THE CARRIAGE
REAPPEARED, AND ALL WAS OVER. THE STYLE OF THE VISIT, AND THE SHORTNESS
OF IT, WERE THEN FELT TO BE DECISIVE. FOURTEEN MINUTES TO BE GIVEN
TO THOSE WITH WHOM SHE HAD THANKFULLY PASSED SIX WEEKS NOT SIX MONTHS
AGO!--EMMA COULD NOT BUT PICTURE IT ALL, AND FEEL HOW JUSTLY THEY MIGHT
RESENT, HOW NATURALLY HARRIET MUST SUFFER. IT WAS A BAD BUSINESS. SHE
WOULD HAVE GIVEN A GREAT DEAL, OR ENDURED A GREAT DEAL, TO HAVE HAD
THE MARTINS IN A HIGHER RANK OF LIFE. THEY WERE SO DESERVING, THAT A
LITTLE HIGHER SHOULD HAVE BEEN ENOUGH: BUT AS IT WAS, HOW COULD SHE
HAVE DONE OTHERWISE?--IMPOSSIBLE!--SHE COULD NOT REPENT. THEY MUST BE
SEPARATED; BUT THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF PAIN IN THE PROCESS--SO MUCH
TO HERSELF AT THIS TIME, THAT SHE SOON FELT THE NECESSITY OF A LITTLE
CONSOLATION, AND RESOLVED ON GOING HOME BY WAY OF RANDALLS TO
PROCURE IT. HER MIND WAS QUITE SICK OF MR. ELTON AND THE MARTINS. THE
REFRESHMENT OF RANDALLS WAS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY.

IT WAS A GOOD SCHEME; BUT ON DRIVING TO THE DOOR THEY HEARD THAT NEITHER
"MASTER NOR MISTRESS WAS AT HOME;" THEY HAD BOTH BEEN OUT SOME TIME; THE
MAN BELIEVED THEY WERE GONE TO HARTFIELD.

"THIS IS TOO BAD," CRIED EMMA, AS THEY TURNED AWAY. "AND NOW WE SHALL
JUST MISS THEM; TOO PROVOKING!--I DO NOT KNOW WHEN I HAVE BEEN SO
DISAPPOINTED." AND SHE LEANED BACK IN THE CORNER, TO INDULGE HER
MURMURS, OR TO REASON THEM AWAY; PROBABLY A LITTLE OF BOTH--SUCH BEING
THE COMMONEST PROCESS OF A NOT ILL-DISPOSED MIND. PRESENTLY THE CARRIAGE
STOPT; SHE LOOKED UP; IT WAS STOPT BY MR. AND MRS. WESTON, WHO WERE
STANDING TO SPEAK TO HER. THERE WAS INSTANT PLEASURE IN THE SIGHT OF
THEM, AND STILL GREATER PLEASURE WAS CONVEYED IN SOUND--FOR MR. WESTON
IMMEDIATELY ACCOSTED HER WITH,

"HOW D'YE DO?--HOW D'YE DO?--WE HAVE BEEN SITTING WITH YOUR FATHER--GLAD
TO SEE HIM SO WELL. FRANK COMES TO-MORROW--I HAD A LETTER THIS
MORNING--WE SEE HIM TO-MORROW BY DINNER-TIME TO A CERTAINTY--HE IS AT
OXFORD TO-DAY, AND HE COMES FOR A WHOLE FORTNIGHT; I KNEW IT WOULD BE
SO. IF HE HAD COME AT CHRISTMAS HE COULD NOT HAVE STAID THREE DAYS; I
WAS ALWAYS GLAD HE DID NOT COME AT CHRISTMAS; NOW WE ARE GOING TO HAVE
JUST THE RIGHT WEATHER FOR HIM, FINE, DRY, SETTLED WEATHER. WE SHALL
ENJOY HIM COMPLETELY; EVERY THING HAS TURNED OUT EXACTLY AS WE COULD
WISH."

THERE WAS NO RESISTING SUCH NEWS, NO POSSIBILITY OF AVOIDING THE
INFLUENCE OF SUCH A HAPPY FACE AS MR. WESTON'S, CONFIRMED AS IT ALL WAS
BY THE WORDS AND THE COUNTENANCE OF HIS WIFE, FEWER AND QUIETER, BUT NOT
LESS TO THE PURPOSE. TO KNOW THAT SHE THOUGHT HIS COMING CERTAIN WAS
ENOUGH TO MAKE EMMA CONSIDER IT SO, AND SINCERELY DID SHE REJOICE IN
THEIR JOY. IT WAS A MOST DELIGHTFUL REANIMATION OF EXHAUSTED SPIRITS.
THE WORN-OUT PAST WAS SUNK IN THE FRESHNESS OF WHAT WAS COMING; AND IN
THE RAPIDITY OF HALF A MOMENT'S THOUGHT, SHE HOPED MR. ELTON WOULD NOW
BE TALKED OF NO MORE.

MR. WESTON GAVE HER THE HISTORY OF THE ENGAGEMENTS AT ENSCOMBE, WHICH
ALLOWED HIS SON TO ANSWER FOR HAVING AN ENTIRE FORTNIGHT AT HIS COMMAND,
AS WELL AS THE ROUTE AND THE METHOD OF HIS JOURNEY; AND SHE LISTENED,
AND SMILED, AND CONGRATULATED.

"I SHALL SOON BRING HIM OVER TO HARTFIELD," SAID HE, AT THE CONCLUSION.

EMMA COULD IMAGINE SHE SAW A TOUCH OF THE ARM AT THIS SPEECH, FROM HIS
WIFE.

"WE HAD BETTER MOVE ON, MR. WESTON," SAID SHE, "WE ARE DETAINING THE
GIRLS."

"WELL, WELL, I AM READY;"--AND TURNING AGAIN TO EMMA, "BUT YOU MUST
NOT BE EXPECTING SUCH A VERY FINE YOUNG MAN; YOU HAVE ONLY
HAD MY ACCOUNT YOU KNOW; I DARE SAY HE IS REALLY NOTHING
EXTRAORDINARY:"--THOUGH HIS OWN SPARKLING EYES AT THE MOMENT WERE
SPEAKING A VERY DIFFERENT CONVICTION.

EMMA COULD LOOK PERFECTLY UNCONSCIOUS AND INNOCENT, AND ANSWER IN A
MANNER THAT APPROPRIATED NOTHING.

"THINK OF ME TO-MORROW, MY DEAR EMMA, ABOUT FOUR O'CLOCK," WAS MRS.
WESTON'S PARTING INJUNCTION; SPOKEN WITH SOME ANXIETY, AND MEANT ONLY
FOR HER.

"FOUR O'CLOCK!--DEPEND UPON IT HE WILL BE HERE BY THREE," WAS MR.
WESTON'S QUICK AMENDMENT; AND SO ENDED A MOST SATISFACTORY MEETING.
EMMA'S SPIRITS WERE MOUNTED QUITE UP TO HAPPINESS; EVERY THING WORE
A DIFFERENT AIR; JAMES AND HIS HORSES SEEMED NOT HALF SO SLUGGISH AS
BEFORE. WHEN SHE LOOKED AT THE HEDGES, SHE THOUGHT THE ELDER AT LEAST
MUST SOON BE COMING OUT; AND WHEN SHE TURNED ROUND TO HARRIET, SHE SAW
SOMETHING LIKE A LOOK OF SPRING, A TENDER SMILE EVEN THERE.

"WILL MR. FRANK CHURCHILL PASS THROUGH BATH AS WELL AS OXFORD?"--WAS A
QUESTION, HOWEVER, WHICH DID NOT AUGUR MUCH.

BUT NEITHER GEOGRAPHY NOR TRANQUILLITY COULD COME ALL AT ONCE, AND EMMA
WAS NOW IN A HUMOUR TO RESOLVE THAT THEY SHOULD BOTH COME IN TIME.

THE MORNING OF THE INTERESTING DAY ARRIVED, AND MRS. WESTON'S FAITHFUL
PUPIL DID NOT FORGET EITHER AT TEN, OR ELEVEN, OR TWELVE O'CLOCK, THAT
SHE WAS TO THINK OF HER AT FOUR.

"MY DEAR, DEAR ANXIOUS FRIEND,"--SAID SHE, IN MENTAL SOLILOQUY, WHILE
WALKING DOWNSTAIRS FROM HER OWN ROOM, "ALWAYS OVERCAREFUL FOR EVERY
BODY'S COMFORT BUT YOUR OWN; I SEE YOU NOW IN ALL YOUR LITTLE FIDGETS,
GOING AGAIN AND AGAIN INTO HIS ROOM, TO BE SURE THAT ALL IS RIGHT."
THE CLOCK STRUCK TWELVE AS SHE PASSED THROUGH THE HALL. "'TIS TWELVE;
I SHALL NOT FORGET TO THINK OF YOU FOUR HOURS HENCE; AND BY THIS
TIME TO-MORROW, PERHAPS, OR A LITTLE LATER, I MAY BE THINKING OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF THEIR ALL CALLING HERE. I AM SURE THEY WILL BRING HIM
SOON."

SHE OPENED THE PARLOUR DOOR, AND SAW TWO GENTLEMEN SITTING WITH HER
FATHER--MR. WESTON AND HIS SON. THEY HAD BEEN ARRIVED ONLY A FEW
MINUTES, AND MR. WESTON HAD SCARCELY FINISHED HIS EXPLANATION OF FRANK'S
BEING A DAY BEFORE HIS TIME, AND HER FATHER WAS YET IN THE MIDST OF HIS
VERY CIVIL WELCOME AND CONGRATULATIONS, WHEN SHE APPEARED, TO HAVE HER
SHARE OF SURPRIZE, INTRODUCTION, AND PLEASURE.

THE FRANK CHURCHILL SO LONG TALKED OF, SO HIGH IN INTEREST, WAS ACTUALLY
BEFORE HER--HE WAS PRESENTED TO HER, AND SHE DID NOT THINK TOO MUCH HAD
BEEN SAID IN HIS PRAISE; HE WAS A VERY GOOD LOOKING YOUNG MAN; HEIGHT,
AIR, ADDRESS, ALL WERE UNEXCEPTIONABLE, AND HIS COUNTENANCE HAD A GREAT
DEAL OF THE SPIRIT AND LIVELINESS OF HIS FATHER'S; HE LOOKED QUICK AND
SENSIBLE. SHE FELT IMMEDIATELY THAT SHE SHOULD LIKE HIM; AND THERE WAS
A WELL-BRED EASE OF MANNER, AND A READINESS TO TALK, WHICH CONVINCED HER
THAT HE CAME INTENDING TO BE ACQUAINTED WITH HER, AND THAT ACQUAINTED
THEY SOON MUST BE.

HE HAD REACHED RANDALLS THE EVENING BEFORE. SHE WAS PLEASED WITH THE
EAGERNESS TO ARRIVE WHICH HAD MADE HIM ALTER HIS PLAN, AND TRAVEL
EARLIER, LATER, AND QUICKER, THAT HE MIGHT GAIN HALF A DAY.

"I TOLD YOU YESTERDAY," CRIED MR. WESTON WITH EXULTATION, "I TOLD YOU
ALL THAT HE WOULD BE HERE BEFORE THE TIME NAMED. I REMEMBERED WHAT I
USED TO DO MYSELF. ONE CANNOT CREEP UPON A JOURNEY; ONE CANNOT HELP
GETTING ON FASTER THAN ONE HAS PLANNED; AND THE PLEASURE OF COMING IN
UPON ONE'S FRIENDS BEFORE THE LOOK-OUT BEGINS, IS WORTH A GREAT DEAL
MORE THAN ANY LITTLE EXERTION IT NEEDS."

"IT IS A GREAT PLEASURE WHERE ONE CAN INDULGE IN IT," SAID THE YOUNG
MAN, "THOUGH THERE ARE NOT MANY HOUSES THAT I SHOULD PRESUME ON SO FAR;
BUT IN COMING HOME I FELT I MIGHT DO ANY THING."

THE WORD HOME MADE HIS FATHER LOOK ON HIM WITH FRESH COMPLACENCY.
EMMA WAS DIRECTLY SURE THAT HE KNEW HOW TO MAKE HIMSELF AGREEABLE; THE
CONVICTION WAS STRENGTHENED BY WHAT FOLLOWED. HE WAS VERY MUCH PLEASED
WITH RANDALLS, THOUGHT IT A MOST ADMIRABLY ARRANGED HOUSE, WOULD HARDLY
ALLOW IT EVEN TO BE VERY SMALL, ADMIRED THE SITUATION, THE WALK TO
HIGHBURY, HIGHBURY ITSELF, HARTFIELD STILL MORE, AND PROFESSED HIMSELF
TO HAVE ALWAYS FELT THE SORT OF INTEREST IN THE COUNTRY WHICH NONE BUT
ONE'S OWN COUNTRY GIVES, AND THE GREATEST CURIOSITY TO VISIT IT. THAT
HE SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN ABLE TO INDULGE SO AMIABLE A FEELING BEFORE,
PASSED SUSPICIOUSLY THROUGH EMMA'S BRAIN; BUT STILL, IF IT WERE A
FALSEHOOD, IT WAS A PLEASANT ONE, AND PLEASANTLY HANDLED. HIS MANNER HAD
NO AIR OF STUDY OR EXAGGERATION. HE DID REALLY LOOK AND SPEAK AS IF IN A
STATE OF NO COMMON ENJOYMENT.

THEIR SUBJECTS IN GENERAL WERE SUCH AS BELONG TO AN OPENING
ACQUAINTANCE. ON HIS SIDE WERE THE INQUIRIES,--"WAS SHE A
HORSEWOMAN?--PLEASANT RIDES?--PLEASANT WALKS?--HAD THEY A LARGE
NEIGHBOURHOOD?--HIGHBURY, PERHAPS, AFFORDED SOCIETY ENOUGH?--THERE WERE
SEVERAL VERY PRETTY HOUSES IN AND ABOUT IT.--BALLS--HAD THEY BALLS?--WAS
IT A MUSICAL SOCIETY?"

BUT WHEN SATISFIED ON ALL THESE POINTS, AND THEIR ACQUAINTANCE
PROPORTIONABLY ADVANCED, HE CONTRIVED TO FIND AN OPPORTUNITY, WHILE
THEIR TWO FATHERS WERE ENGAGED WITH EACH OTHER, OF INTRODUCING HIS
MOTHER-IN-LAW, AND SPEAKING OF HER WITH SO MUCH HANDSOME PRAISE, SO MUCH
WARM ADMIRATION, SO MUCH GRATITUDE FOR THE HAPPINESS SHE SECURED TO HIS
FATHER, AND HER VERY KIND RECEPTION OF HIMSELF, AS WAS AN ADDITIONAL
PROOF OF HIS KNOWING HOW TO PLEASE--AND OF HIS CERTAINLY THINKING IT
WORTH WHILE TO TRY TO PLEASE HER. HE DID NOT ADVANCE A WORD OF PRAISE
BEYOND WHAT SHE KNEW TO BE THOROUGHLY DESERVED BY MRS. WESTON; BUT,
UNDOUBTEDLY HE COULD KNOW VERY LITTLE OF THE MATTER. HE UNDERSTOOD
WHAT WOULD BE WELCOME; HE COULD BE SURE OF LITTLE ELSE. "HIS FATHER'S
MARRIAGE," HE SAID, "HAD BEEN THE WISEST MEASURE, EVERY FRIEND MUST
REJOICE IN IT; AND THE FAMILY FROM WHOM HE HAD RECEIVED SUCH A BLESSING
MUST BE EVER CONSIDERED AS HAVING CONFERRED THE HIGHEST OBLIGATION ON
HIM."

HE GOT AS NEAR AS HE COULD TO THANKING HER FOR MISS TAYLOR'S MERITS,
WITHOUT SEEMING QUITE TO FORGET THAT IN THE COMMON COURSE OF THINGS IT
WAS TO BE RATHER SUPPOSED THAT MISS TAYLOR HAD FORMED MISS WOODHOUSE'S
CHARACTER, THAN MISS WOODHOUSE MISS TAYLOR'S. AND AT LAST, AS IF
RESOLVED TO QUALIFY HIS OPINION COMPLETELY FOR TRAVELLING ROUND TO ITS
OBJECT, HE WOUND IT ALL UP WITH ASTONISHMENT AT THE YOUTH AND BEAUTY OF
HER PERSON.

"ELEGANT, AGREEABLE MANNERS, I WAS PREPARED FOR," SAID HE; "BUT I
CONFESS THAT, CONSIDERING EVERY THING, I HAD NOT EXPECTED MORE THAN A
VERY TOLERABLY WELL-LOOKING WOMAN OF A CERTAIN AGE; I DID NOT KNOW THAT
I WAS TO FIND A PRETTY YOUNG WOMAN IN MRS. WESTON."

"YOU CANNOT SEE TOO MUCH PERFECTION IN MRS. WESTON FOR MY FEELINGS,"
SAID EMMA; "WERE YOU TO GUESS HER TO BE EIGHTEEN, I SHOULD LISTEN WITH
PLEASURE; BUT SHE WOULD BE READY TO QUARREL WITH YOU FOR USING SUCH
WORDS. DON'T LET HER IMAGINE THAT YOU HAVE SPOKEN OF HER AS A PRETTY
YOUNG WOMAN."

"I HOPE I SHOULD KNOW BETTER," HE REPLIED; "NO, DEPEND UPON IT, (WITH A
GALLANT BOW,) THAT IN ADDRESSING MRS. WESTON I SHOULD UNDERSTAND WHOM
I MIGHT PRAISE WITHOUT ANY DANGER OF BEING THOUGHT EXTRAVAGANT IN MY
TERMS."

EMMA WONDERED WHETHER THE SAME SUSPICION OF WHAT MIGHT BE EXPECTED FROM
THEIR KNOWING EACH OTHER, WHICH HAD TAKEN STRONG POSSESSION OF HER MIND,
HAD EVER CROSSED HIS; AND WHETHER HIS COMPLIMENTS WERE TO BE CONSIDERED
AS MARKS OF ACQUIESCENCE, OR PROOFS OF DEFIANCE. SHE MUST SEE MORE
OF HIM TO UNDERSTAND HIS WAYS; AT PRESENT SHE ONLY FELT THEY WERE
AGREEABLE.

SHE HAD NO DOUBT OF WHAT MR. WESTON WAS OFTEN THINKING ABOUT. HIS QUICK
EYE SHE DETECTED AGAIN AND AGAIN GLANCING TOWARDS THEM WITH A HAPPY
EXPRESSION; AND EVEN, WHEN HE MIGHT HAVE DETERMINED NOT TO LOOK, SHE WAS
CONFIDENT THAT HE WAS OFTEN LISTENING.

HER OWN FATHER'S PERFECT EXEMPTION FROM ANY THOUGHT OF THE KIND, THE
ENTIRE DEFICIENCY IN HIM OF ALL SUCH SORT OF PENETRATION OR SUSPICION,
WAS A MOST COMFORTABLE CIRCUMSTANCE. HAPPILY HE WAS NOT FARTHER FROM
APPROVING MATRIMONY THAN FROM FORESEEING IT.--THOUGH ALWAYS OBJECTING
TO EVERY MARRIAGE THAT WAS ARRANGED, HE NEVER SUFFERED BEFOREHAND FROM
THE APPREHENSION OF ANY; IT SEEMED AS IF HE COULD NOT THINK SO ILL OF
ANY TWO PERSONS' UNDERSTANDING AS TO SUPPOSE THEY MEANT TO MARRY TILL IT
WERE PROVED AGAINST THEM. SHE BLESSED THE FAVOURING BLINDNESS. HE COULD
NOW, WITHOUT THE DRAWBACK OF A SINGLE UNPLEASANT SURMISE, WITHOUT A
GLANCE FORWARD AT ANY POSSIBLE TREACHERY IN HIS GUEST, GIVE WAY TO ALL
HIS NATURAL KIND-HEARTED CIVILITY IN SOLICITOUS INQUIRIES AFTER MR.
FRANK CHURCHILL'S ACCOMMODATION ON HIS JOURNEY, THROUGH THE SAD EVILS
OF SLEEPING TWO NIGHTS ON THE ROAD, AND EXPRESS VERY GENUINE UNMIXED
ANXIETY TO KNOW THAT HE HAD CERTAINLY ESCAPED CATCHING COLD--WHICH,
HOWEVER, HE COULD NOT ALLOW HIM TO FEEL QUITE ASSURED OF HIMSELF TILL
AFTER ANOTHER NIGHT.

A REASONABLE VISIT PAID, MR. WESTON BEGAN TO MOVE.--"HE MUST BE GOING.
HE HAD BUSINESS AT THE CROWN ABOUT HIS HAY, AND A GREAT MANY ERRANDS FOR
MRS. WESTON AT FORD'S, BUT HE NEED NOT HURRY ANY BODY ELSE." HIS SON,
TOO WELL BRED TO HEAR THE HINT, ROSE IMMEDIATELY ALSO, SAYING,

"AS YOU ARE GOING FARTHER ON BUSINESS, SIR, I WILL TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY
OF PAYING A VISIT, WHICH MUST BE PAID SOME DAY OR OTHER, AND THEREFORE
MAY AS WELL BE PAID NOW. I HAVE THE HONOUR OF BEING ACQUAINTED WITH
A NEIGHBOUR OF YOURS, (TURNING TO EMMA,) A LADY RESIDING IN OR NEAR
HIGHBURY; A FAMILY OF THE NAME OF FAIRFAX. I SHALL HAVE NO DIFFICULTY,
I SUPPOSE, IN FINDING THE HOUSE; THOUGH FAIRFAX, I BELIEVE, IS NOT
THE PROPER NAME--I SHOULD RATHER SAY BARNES, OR BATES. DO YOU KNOW ANY
FAMILY OF THAT NAME?"

"TO BE SURE WE DO," CRIED HIS FATHER; "MRS. BATES--WE PASSED HER
HOUSE--I SAW MISS BATES AT THE WINDOW. TRUE, TRUE, YOU ARE ACQUAINTED
WITH MISS FAIRFAX; I REMEMBER YOU KNEW HER AT WEYMOUTH, AND A FINE GIRL
SHE IS. CALL UPON HER, BY ALL MEANS."

"THERE IS NO NECESSITY FOR MY CALLING THIS MORNING," SAID THE YOUNG MAN;
"ANOTHER DAY WOULD DO AS WELL; BUT THERE WAS THAT DEGREE OF ACQUAINTANCE
AT WEYMOUTH WHICH--"

"OH! GO TO-DAY, GO TO-DAY. DO NOT DEFER IT. WHAT IS RIGHT TO BE DONE
CANNOT BE DONE TOO SOON. AND, BESIDES, I MUST GIVE YOU A HINT, FRANK;
ANY WANT OF ATTENTION TO HER HERE SHOULD BE CAREFULLY AVOIDED. YOU SAW
HER WITH THE CAMPBELLS, WHEN SHE WAS THE EQUAL OF EVERY BODY SHE MIXED
WITH, BUT HERE SHE IS WITH A POOR OLD GRANDMOTHER, WHO HAS BARELY ENOUGH
TO LIVE ON. IF YOU DO NOT CALL EARLY IT WILL BE A SLIGHT."

THE SON LOOKED CONVINCED.

"I HAVE HEARD HER SPEAK OF THE ACQUAINTANCE," SAID EMMA; "SHE IS A VERY
ELEGANT YOUNG WOMAN."

HE AGREED TO IT, BUT WITH SO QUIET A "YES," AS INCLINED HER ALMOST TO
DOUBT HIS REAL CONCURRENCE; AND YET THERE MUST BE A VERY DISTINCT SORT
OF ELEGANCE FOR THE FASHIONABLE WORLD, IF JANE FAIRFAX COULD BE THOUGHT
ONLY ORDINARILY GIFTED WITH IT.

"IF YOU WERE NEVER PARTICULARLY STRUCK BY HER MANNERS BEFORE," SAID SHE,
"I THINK YOU WILL TO-DAY. YOU WILL SEE HER TO ADVANTAGE; SEE HER AND
HEAR HER--NO, I AM AFRAID YOU WILL NOT HEAR HER AT ALL, FOR SHE HAS AN
AUNT WHO NEVER HOLDS HER TONGUE."

"YOU ARE ACQUAINTED WITH MISS JANE FAIRFAX, SIR, ARE YOU?" SAID MR.
WOODHOUSE, ALWAYS THE LAST TO MAKE HIS WAY IN CONVERSATION; "THEN GIVE
ME LEAVE TO ASSURE YOU THAT YOU WILL FIND HER A VERY AGREEABLE YOUNG
LADY. SHE IS STAYING HERE ON A VISIT TO HER GRANDMAMA AND AUNT, VERY
WORTHY PEOPLE; I HAVE KNOWN THEM ALL MY LIFE. THEY WILL BE EXTREMELY
GLAD TO SEE YOU, I AM SURE; AND ONE OF MY SERVANTS SHALL GO WITH YOU TO
SHEW YOU THE WAY."

"MY DEAR SIR, UPON NO ACCOUNT IN THE WORLD; MY FATHER CAN DIRECT ME."

"BUT YOUR FATHER IS NOT GOING SO FAR; HE IS ONLY GOING TO THE CROWN,
QUITE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET, AND THERE ARE A GREAT MANY
HOUSES; YOU MIGHT BE VERY MUCH AT A LOSS, AND IT IS A VERY DIRTY WALK,
UNLESS YOU KEEP ON THE FOOTPATH; BUT MY COACHMAN CAN TELL YOU WHERE YOU
HAD BEST CROSS THE STREET."

MR. FRANK CHURCHILL STILL DECLINED IT, LOOKING AS SERIOUS AS HE COULD,
AND HIS FATHER GAVE HIS HEARTY SUPPORT BY CALLING OUT, "MY GOOD FRIEND,
THIS IS QUITE UNNECESSARY; FRANK KNOWS A PUDDLE OF WATER WHEN HE SEES
IT, AND AS TO MRS. BATES'S, HE MAY GET THERE FROM THE CROWN IN A HOP,
STEP, AND JUMP."

THEY WERE PERMITTED TO GO ALONE; AND WITH A CORDIAL NOD FROM ONE, AND A
GRACEFUL BOW FROM THE OTHER, THE TWO GENTLEMEN TOOK LEAVE. EMMA REMAINED
VERY WELL PLEASED WITH THIS BEGINNING OF THE ACQUAINTANCE, AND COULD NOW
ENGAGE TO THINK OF THEM ALL AT RANDALLS ANY HOUR OF THE DAY, WITH FULL
CONFIDENCE IN THEIR COMFORT.



CHAPTER VI


THE NEXT MORNING BROUGHT MR. FRANK CHURCHILL AGAIN. HE CAME WITH MRS.
WESTON, TO WHOM AND TO HIGHBURY HE SEEMED TO TAKE VERY CORDIALLY. HE HAD
BEEN SITTING WITH HER, IT APPEARED, MOST COMPANIONABLY AT HOME, TILL
HER USUAL HOUR OF EXERCISE; AND ON BEING DESIRED TO CHUSE THEIR WALK,
IMMEDIATELY FIXED ON HIGHBURY.--"HE DID NOT DOUBT THERE BEING VERY
PLEASANT WALKS IN EVERY DIRECTION, BUT IF LEFT TO HIM, HE SHOULD ALWAYS
CHUSE THE SAME. HIGHBURY, THAT AIRY, CHEERFUL, HAPPY-LOOKING HIGHBURY,
WOULD BE HIS CONSTANT ATTRACTION."--HIGHBURY, WITH MRS. WESTON, STOOD
FOR HARTFIELD; AND SHE TRUSTED TO ITS BEARING THE SAME CONSTRUCTION WITH
HIM. THEY WALKED THITHER DIRECTLY.

EMMA HAD HARDLY EXPECTED THEM: FOR MR. WESTON, WHO HAD CALLED IN FOR
HALF A MINUTE, IN ORDER TO HEAR THAT HIS SON WAS VERY HANDSOME, KNEW
NOTHING OF THEIR PLANS; AND IT WAS AN AGREEABLE SURPRIZE TO HER,
THEREFORE, TO PERCEIVE THEM WALKING UP TO THE HOUSE TOGETHER, ARM IN
ARM. SHE WAS WANTING TO SEE HIM AGAIN, AND ESPECIALLY TO SEE HIM IN
COMPANY WITH MRS. WESTON, UPON HIS BEHAVIOUR TO WHOM HER OPINION OF HIM
WAS TO DEPEND. IF HE WERE DEFICIENT THERE, NOTHING SHOULD MAKE AMENDS
FOR IT. BUT ON SEEING THEM TOGETHER, SHE BECAME PERFECTLY SATISFIED. IT
WAS NOT MERELY IN FINE WORDS OR HYPERBOLICAL COMPLIMENT THAT HE PAID HIS
DUTY; NOTHING COULD BE MORE PROPER OR PLEASING THAN HIS WHOLE MANNER TO
HER--NOTHING COULD MORE AGREEABLY DENOTE HIS WISH OF CONSIDERING HER AS
A FRIEND AND SECURING HER AFFECTION. AND THERE WAS TIME ENOUGH FOR EMMA
TO FORM A REASONABLE JUDGMENT, AS THEIR VISIT INCLUDED ALL THE REST OF
THE MORNING. THEY WERE ALL THREE WALKING ABOUT TOGETHER FOR AN HOUR
OR TWO--FIRST ROUND THE SHRUBBERIES OF HARTFIELD, AND AFTERWARDS
IN HIGHBURY. HE WAS DELIGHTED WITH EVERY THING; ADMIRED HARTFIELD
SUFFICIENTLY FOR MR. WOODHOUSE'S EAR; AND WHEN THEIR GOING FARTHER WAS
RESOLVED ON, CONFESSED HIS WISH TO BE MADE ACQUAINTED WITH THE WHOLE
VILLAGE, AND FOUND MATTER OF COMMENDATION AND INTEREST MUCH OFTENER THAN
EMMA COULD HAVE SUPPOSED.

SOME OF THE OBJECTS OF HIS CURIOSITY SPOKE VERY AMIABLE FEELINGS. HE
BEGGED TO BE SHEWN THE HOUSE WHICH HIS FATHER HAD LIVED IN SO LONG, AND
WHICH HAD BEEN THE HOME OF HIS FATHER'S FATHER; AND ON RECOLLECTING THAT
AN OLD WOMAN WHO HAD NURSED HIM WAS STILL LIVING, WALKED IN QUEST OF
HER COTTAGE FROM ONE END OF THE STREET TO THE OTHER; AND THOUGH IN
SOME POINTS OF PURSUIT OR OBSERVATION THERE WAS NO POSITIVE MERIT, THEY
SHEWED, ALTOGETHER, A GOOD-WILL TOWARDS HIGHBURY IN GENERAL, WHICH MUST
BE VERY LIKE A MERIT TO THOSE HE WAS WITH.

EMMA WATCHED AND DECIDED, THAT WITH SUCH FEELINGS AS WERE NOW SHEWN, IT
COULD NOT BE FAIRLY SUPPOSED THAT HE HAD BEEN EVER VOLUNTARILY ABSENTING
HIMSELF; THAT HE HAD NOT BEEN ACTING A PART, OR MAKING A PARADE OF
INSINCERE PROFESSIONS; AND THAT MR. KNIGHTLEY CERTAINLY HAD NOT DONE HIM
JUSTICE.

THEIR FIRST PAUSE WAS AT THE CROWN INN, AN INCONSIDERABLE HOUSE, THOUGH
THE PRINCIPAL ONE OF THE SORT, WHERE A COUPLE OF PAIR OF POST-HORSES
WERE KEPT, MORE FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD THAN FROM ANY
RUN ON THE ROAD; AND HIS COMPANIONS HAD NOT EXPECTED TO BE DETAINED BY
ANY INTEREST EXCITED THERE; BUT IN PASSING IT THEY GAVE THE HISTORY OF
THE LARGE ROOM VISIBLY ADDED; IT HAD BEEN BUILT MANY YEARS AGO FOR
A BALL-ROOM, AND WHILE THE NEIGHBOURHOOD HAD BEEN IN A PARTICULARLY
POPULOUS, DANCING STATE, HAD BEEN OCCASIONALLY USED AS SUCH;--BUT SUCH
BRILLIANT DAYS HAD LONG PASSED AWAY, AND NOW THE HIGHEST PURPOSE FOR
WHICH IT WAS EVER WANTED WAS TO ACCOMMODATE A WHIST CLUB ESTABLISHED
AMONG THE GENTLEMEN AND HALF-GENTLEMEN OF THE PLACE. HE WAS IMMEDIATELY
INTERESTED. ITS CHARACTER AS A BALL-ROOM CAUGHT HIM; AND INSTEAD OF
PASSING ON, HE STOPT FOR SEVERAL MINUTES AT THE TWO SUPERIOR SASHED
WINDOWS WHICH WERE OPEN, TO LOOK IN AND CONTEMPLATE ITS CAPABILITIES,
AND LAMENT THAT ITS ORIGINAL PURPOSE SHOULD HAVE CEASED. HE SAW NO FAULT
IN THE ROOM, HE WOULD ACKNOWLEDGE NONE WHICH THEY SUGGESTED. NO, IT
WAS LONG ENOUGH, BROAD ENOUGH, HANDSOME ENOUGH. IT WOULD HOLD THE
VERY NUMBER FOR COMFORT. THEY OUGHT TO HAVE BALLS THERE AT LEAST EVERY
FORTNIGHT THROUGH THE WINTER. WHY HAD NOT MISS WOODHOUSE REVIVED
THE FORMER GOOD OLD DAYS OF THE ROOM?--SHE WHO COULD DO ANY THING IN
HIGHBURY! THE WANT OF PROPER FAMILIES IN THE PLACE, AND THE CONVICTION
THAT NONE BEYOND THE PLACE AND ITS IMMEDIATE ENVIRONS COULD BE TEMPTED
TO ATTEND, WERE MENTIONED; BUT HE WAS NOT SATISFIED. HE COULD NOT BE
PERSUADED THAT SO MANY GOOD-LOOKING HOUSES AS HE SAW AROUND HIM, COULD
NOT FURNISH NUMBERS ENOUGH FOR SUCH A MEETING; AND EVEN WHEN PARTICULARS
WERE GIVEN AND FAMILIES DESCRIBED, HE WAS STILL UNWILLING TO ADMIT THAT
THE INCONVENIENCE OF SUCH A MIXTURE WOULD BE ANY THING, OR THAT THERE
WOULD BE THE SMALLEST DIFFICULTY IN EVERY BODY'S RETURNING INTO THEIR
PROPER PLACE THE NEXT MORNING. HE ARGUED LIKE A YOUNG MAN VERY MUCH BENT
ON DANCING; AND EMMA WAS RATHER SURPRIZED TO SEE THE CONSTITUTION OF
THE WESTON PREVAIL SO DECIDEDLY AGAINST THE HABITS OF THE CHURCHILLS.
HE SEEMED TO HAVE ALL THE LIFE AND SPIRIT, CHEERFUL FEELINGS, AND SOCIAL
INCLINATIONS OF HIS FATHER, AND NOTHING OF THE PRIDE OR RESERVE OF
ENSCOMBE. OF PRIDE, INDEED, THERE WAS, PERHAPS, SCARCELY ENOUGH; HIS
INDIFFERENCE TO A CONFUSION OF RANK, BORDERED TOO MUCH ON INELEGANCE OF
MIND. HE COULD BE NO JUDGE, HOWEVER, OF THE EVIL HE WAS HOLDING CHEAP.
IT WAS BUT AN EFFUSION OF LIVELY SPIRITS.

AT LAST HE WAS PERSUADED TO MOVE ON FROM THE FRONT OF THE CROWN;
AND BEING NOW ALMOST FACING THE HOUSE WHERE THE BATESES LODGED, EMMA
RECOLLECTED HIS INTENDED VISIT THE DAY BEFORE, AND ASKED HIM IF HE HAD
PAID IT.

"YES, OH! YES"--HE REPLIED; "I WAS JUST GOING TO MENTION IT. A VERY
SUCCESSFUL VISIT:--I SAW ALL THE THREE LADIES; AND FELT VERY MUCH
OBLIGED TO YOU FOR YOUR PREPARATORY HINT. IF THE TALKING AUNT HAD TAKEN
ME QUITE BY SURPRIZE, IT MUST HAVE BEEN THE DEATH OF ME. AS IT WAS, I
WAS ONLY BETRAYED INTO PAYING A MOST UNREASONABLE VISIT. TEN MINUTES
WOULD HAVE BEEN ALL THAT WAS NECESSARY, PERHAPS ALL THAT WAS PROPER; AND
I HAD TOLD MY FATHER I SHOULD CERTAINLY BE AT HOME BEFORE HIM--BUT THERE
WAS NO GETTING AWAY, NO PAUSE; AND, TO MY UTTER ASTONISHMENT, I FOUND,
WHEN HE (FINDING ME NOWHERE ELSE) JOINED ME THERE AT LAST, THAT I HAD
BEEN ACTUALLY SITTING WITH THEM VERY NEARLY THREE-QUARTERS OF AN HOUR.
THE GOOD LADY HAD NOT GIVEN ME THE POSSIBILITY OF ESCAPE BEFORE."

"AND HOW DID YOU THINK MISS FAIRFAX LOOKING?"

"ILL, VERY ILL--THAT IS, IF A YOUNG LADY CAN EVER BE ALLOWED TO LOOK
ILL. BUT THE EXPRESSION IS HARDLY ADMISSIBLE, MRS. WESTON, IS IT? LADIES
CAN NEVER LOOK ILL. AND, SERIOUSLY, MISS FAIRFAX IS NATURALLY SO
PALE, AS ALMOST ALWAYS TO GIVE THE APPEARANCE OF ILL HEALTH.--A MOST
DEPLORABLE WANT OF COMPLEXION."

EMMA WOULD NOT AGREE TO THIS, AND BEGAN A WARM DEFENCE OF MISS FAIRFAX'S
COMPLEXION. "IT WAS CERTAINLY NEVER BRILLIANT, BUT SHE WOULD NOT
ALLOW IT TO HAVE A SICKLY HUE IN GENERAL; AND THERE WAS A SOFTNESS AND
DELICACY IN HER SKIN WHICH GAVE PECULIAR ELEGANCE TO THE CHARACTER OF
HER FACE." HE LISTENED WITH ALL DUE DEFERENCE; ACKNOWLEDGED THAT HE HAD
HEARD MANY PEOPLE SAY THE SAME--BUT YET HE MUST CONFESS, THAT TO HIM
NOTHING COULD MAKE AMENDS FOR THE WANT OF THE FINE GLOW OF HEALTH. WHERE
FEATURES WERE INDIFFERENT, A FINE COMPLEXION GAVE BEAUTY TO THEM ALL;
AND WHERE THEY WERE GOOD, THE EFFECT WAS--FORTUNATELY HE NEED NOT
ATTEMPT TO DESCRIBE WHAT THE EFFECT WAS.

"WELL," SAID EMMA, "THERE IS NO DISPUTING ABOUT TASTE.--AT LEAST YOU
ADMIRE HER EXCEPT HER COMPLEXION."

HE SHOOK HIS HEAD AND LAUGHED.--"I CANNOT SEPARATE MISS FAIRFAX AND HER
COMPLEXION."

"DID YOU SEE HER OFTEN AT WEYMOUTH? WERE YOU OFTEN IN THE SAME SOCIETY?"

AT THIS MOMENT THEY WERE APPROACHING FORD'S, AND HE HASTILY EXCLAIMED,
"HA! THIS MUST BE THE VERY SHOP THAT EVERY BODY ATTENDS EVERY DAY OF
THEIR LIVES, AS MY FATHER INFORMS ME. HE COMES TO HIGHBURY HIMSELF, HE
SAYS, SIX DAYS OUT OF THE SEVEN, AND HAS ALWAYS BUSINESS AT FORD'S.
IF IT BE NOT INCONVENIENT TO YOU, PRAY LET US GO IN, THAT I MAY PROVE
MYSELF TO BELONG TO THE PLACE, TO BE A TRUE CITIZEN OF HIGHBURY. I MUST
BUY SOMETHING AT FORD'S. IT WILL BE TAKING OUT MY FREEDOM.--I DARE SAY
THEY SELL GLOVES."

"OH! YES, GLOVES AND EVERY THING. I DO ADMIRE YOUR PATRIOTISM. YOU WILL
BE ADORED IN HIGHBURY. YOU WERE VERY POPULAR BEFORE YOU CAME, BECAUSE
YOU WERE MR. WESTON'S SON--BUT LAY OUT HALF A GUINEA AT FORD'S, AND YOUR
POPULARITY WILL STAND UPON YOUR OWN VIRTUES."

THEY WENT IN; AND WHILE THE SLEEK, WELL-TIED PARCELS OF "MEN'S BEAVERS"
AND "YORK TAN" WERE BRINGING DOWN AND DISPLAYING ON THE COUNTER, HE
SAID--"BUT I BEG YOUR PARDON, MISS WOODHOUSE, YOU WERE SPEAKING TO ME,
YOU WERE SAYING SOMETHING AT THE VERY MOMENT OF THIS BURST OF MY AMOR
PATRIAE. DO NOT LET ME LOSE IT. I ASSURE YOU THE UTMOST STRETCH OF
PUBLIC FAME WOULD NOT MAKE ME AMENDS FOR THE LOSS OF ANY HAPPINESS IN
PRIVATE LIFE."

"I MERELY ASKED, WHETHER YOU HAD KNOWN MUCH OF MISS FAIRFAX AND HER
PARTY AT WEYMOUTH."

"AND NOW THAT I UNDERSTAND YOUR QUESTION, I MUST PRONOUNCE IT TO BE A
VERY UNFAIR ONE. IT IS ALWAYS THE LADY'S RIGHT TO DECIDE ON THE DEGREE
OF ACQUAINTANCE. MISS FAIRFAX MUST ALREADY HAVE GIVEN HER ACCOUNT.--I
SHALL NOT COMMIT MYSELF BY CLAIMING MORE THAN SHE MAY CHUSE TO ALLOW."

"UPON MY WORD! YOU ANSWER AS DISCREETLY AS SHE COULD DO HERSELF. BUT
HER ACCOUNT OF EVERY THING LEAVES SO MUCH TO BE GUESSED, SHE IS SO VERY
RESERVED, SO VERY UNWILLING TO GIVE THE LEAST INFORMATION ABOUT ANY
BODY, THAT I REALLY THINK YOU MAY SAY WHAT YOU LIKE OF YOUR ACQUAINTANCE
WITH HER."

"MAY I, INDEED?--THEN I WILL SPEAK THE TRUTH, AND NOTHING SUITS ME SO
WELL. I MET HER FREQUENTLY AT WEYMOUTH. I HAD KNOWN THE CAMPBELLS A
LITTLE IN TOWN; AND AT WEYMOUTH WE WERE VERY MUCH IN THE SAME SET.
COLONEL CAMPBELL IS A VERY AGREEABLE MAN, AND MRS. CAMPBELL A FRIENDLY,
WARM-HEARTED WOMAN. I LIKE THEM ALL."

"YOU KNOW MISS FAIRFAX'S SITUATION IN LIFE, I CONCLUDE; WHAT SHE IS
DESTINED TO BE?"

"YES--(RATHER HESITATINGLY)--I BELIEVE I DO."

"YOU GET UPON DELICATE SUBJECTS, EMMA," SAID MRS. WESTON SMILING;
"REMEMBER THAT I AM HERE.--MR. FRANK CHURCHILL HARDLY KNOWS WHAT TO SAY
WHEN YOU SPEAK OF MISS FAIRFAX'S SITUATION IN LIFE. I WILL MOVE A LITTLE
FARTHER OFF."

"I CERTAINLY DO FORGET TO THINK OF HER," SAID EMMA, "AS HAVING EVER
BEEN ANY THING BUT MY FRIEND AND MY DEAREST FRIEND."

HE LOOKED AS IF HE FULLY UNDERSTOOD AND HONOURED SUCH A SENTIMENT.

WHEN THE GLOVES WERE BOUGHT, AND THEY HAD QUITTED THE SHOP AGAIN, "DID
YOU EVER HEAR THE YOUNG LADY WE WERE SPEAKING OF, PLAY?" SAID FRANK
CHURCHILL.

"EVER HEAR HER!" REPEATED EMMA. "YOU FORGET HOW MUCH SHE BELONGS TO
HIGHBURY. I HAVE HEARD HER EVERY YEAR OF OUR LIVES SINCE WE BOTH BEGAN.
SHE PLAYS CHARMINGLY."

"YOU THINK SO, DO YOU?--I WANTED THE OPINION OF SOME ONE WHO
COULD REALLY JUDGE. SHE APPEARED TO ME TO PLAY WELL, THAT IS, WITH
CONSIDERABLE TASTE, BUT I KNOW NOTHING OF THE MATTER MYSELF.--I AM
EXCESSIVELY FOND OF MUSIC, BUT WITHOUT THE SMALLEST SKILL OR RIGHT
OF JUDGING OF ANY BODY'S PERFORMANCE.--I HAVE BEEN USED TO HEAR HER'S
ADMIRED; AND I REMEMBER ONE PROOF OF HER BEING THOUGHT TO PLAY WELL:--A
MAN, A VERY MUSICAL MAN, AND IN LOVE WITH ANOTHER WOMAN--ENGAGED TO
HER--ON THE POINT OF MARRIAGE--WOULD YET NEVER ASK THAT OTHER WOMAN
TO SIT DOWN TO THE INSTRUMENT, IF THE LADY IN QUESTION COULD SIT DOWN
INSTEAD--NEVER SEEMED TO LIKE TO HEAR ONE IF HE COULD HEAR THE OTHER.
THAT, I THOUGHT, IN A MAN OF KNOWN MUSICAL TALENT, WAS SOME PROOF."

"PROOF INDEED!" SAID EMMA, HIGHLY AMUSED.--"MR. DIXON IS VERY MUSICAL,
IS HE? WE SHALL KNOW MORE ABOUT THEM ALL, IN HALF AN HOUR, FROM YOU,
THAN MISS FAIRFAX WOULD HAVE VOUCHSAFED IN HALF A YEAR."

"YES, MR. DIXON AND MISS CAMPBELL WERE THE PERSONS; AND I THOUGHT IT A
VERY STRONG PROOF."

"CERTAINLY--VERY STRONG IT WAS; TO OWN THE TRUTH, A GREAT DEAL STRONGER
THAN, IF I HAD BEEN MISS CAMPBELL, WOULD HAVE BEEN AT ALL AGREEABLE
TO ME. I COULD NOT EXCUSE A MAN'S HAVING MORE MUSIC THAN LOVE--MORE EAR
THAN EYE--A MORE ACUTE SENSIBILITY TO FINE SOUNDS THAN TO MY FEELINGS.
HOW DID MISS CAMPBELL APPEAR TO LIKE IT?"

"IT WAS HER VERY PARTICULAR FRIEND, YOU KNOW."

"POOR COMFORT!" SAID EMMA, LAUGHING. "ONE WOULD RATHER HAVE A STRANGER
PREFERRED THAN ONE'S VERY PARTICULAR FRIEND--WITH A STRANGER IT MIGHT
NOT RECUR AGAIN--BUT THE MISERY OF HAVING A VERY PARTICULAR FRIEND
ALWAYS AT HAND, TO DO EVERY THING BETTER THAN ONE DOES ONESELF!--POOR
MRS. DIXON! WELL, I AM GLAD SHE IS GONE TO SETTLE IN IRELAND."

"YOU ARE RIGHT. IT WAS NOT VERY FLATTERING TO MISS CAMPBELL; BUT SHE
REALLY DID NOT SEEM TO FEEL IT."

"SO MUCH THE BETTER--OR SO MUCH THE WORSE:--I DO NOT KNOW WHICH. BUT
BE IT SWEETNESS OR BE IT STUPIDITY IN HER--QUICKNESS OF FRIENDSHIP, OR
DULNESS OF FEELING--THERE WAS ONE PERSON, I THINK, WHO MUST HAVE FELT
IT: MISS FAIRFAX HERSELF. SHE MUST HAVE FELT THE IMPROPER AND DANGEROUS
DISTINCTION."

"AS TO THAT--I DO NOT--"

"OH! DO NOT IMAGINE THAT I EXPECT AN ACCOUNT OF MISS FAIRFAX'S
SENSATIONS FROM YOU, OR FROM ANY BODY ELSE. THEY ARE KNOWN TO NO HUMAN
BEING, I GUESS, BUT HERSELF. BUT IF SHE CONTINUED TO PLAY WHENEVER SHE
WAS ASKED BY MR. DIXON, ONE MAY GUESS WHAT ONE CHUSES."

"THERE APPEARED SUCH A PERFECTLY GOOD UNDERSTANDING AMONG THEM ALL--"
HE BEGAN RATHER QUICKLY, BUT CHECKING HIMSELF, ADDED, "HOWEVER, IT IS
IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO SAY ON WHAT TERMS THEY REALLY WERE--HOW IT MIGHT
ALL BE BEHIND THE SCENES. I CAN ONLY SAY THAT THERE WAS SMOOTHNESS
OUTWARDLY. BUT YOU, WHO HAVE KNOWN MISS FAIRFAX FROM A CHILD, MUST BE
A BETTER JUDGE OF HER CHARACTER, AND OF HOW SHE IS LIKELY TO CONDUCT
HERSELF IN CRITICAL SITUATIONS, THAN I CAN BE."

"I HAVE KNOWN HER FROM A CHILD, UNDOUBTEDLY; WE HAVE BEEN CHILDREN
AND WOMEN TOGETHER; AND IT IS NATURAL TO SUPPOSE THAT WE SHOULD BE
INTIMATE,--THAT WE SHOULD HAVE TAKEN TO EACH OTHER WHENEVER SHE VISITED
HER FRIENDS. BUT WE NEVER DID. I HARDLY KNOW HOW IT HAS HAPPENED; A
LITTLE, PERHAPS, FROM THAT WICKEDNESS ON MY SIDE WHICH WAS PRONE TO TAKE
DISGUST TOWARDS A GIRL SO IDOLIZED AND SO CRIED UP AS SHE ALWAYS WAS,
BY HER AUNT AND GRANDMOTHER, AND ALL THEIR SET. AND THEN, HER RESERVE--I
NEVER COULD ATTACH MYSELF TO ANY ONE SO COMPLETELY RESERVED."

"IT IS A MOST REPULSIVE QUALITY, INDEED," SAID HE. "OFTENTIMES VERY
CONVENIENT, NO DOUBT, BUT NEVER PLEASING. THERE IS SAFETY IN RESERVE,
BUT NO ATTRACTION. ONE CANNOT LOVE A RESERVED PERSON."

"NOT TILL THE RESERVE CEASES TOWARDS ONESELF; AND THEN THE ATTRACTION
MAY BE THE GREATER. BUT I MUST BE MORE IN WANT OF A FRIEND, OR AN
AGREEABLE COMPANION, THAN I HAVE YET BEEN, TO TAKE THE TROUBLE OF
CONQUERING ANY BODY'S RESERVE TO PROCURE ONE. INTIMACY BETWEEN MISS
FAIRFAX AND ME IS QUITE OUT OF THE QUESTION. I HAVE NO REASON TO THINK
ILL OF HER--NOT THE LEAST--EXCEPT THAT SUCH EXTREME AND PERPETUAL
CAUTIOUSNESS OF WORD AND MANNER, SUCH A DREAD OF GIVING A DISTINCT IDEA
ABOUT ANY BODY, IS APT TO SUGGEST SUSPICIONS OF THERE BEING SOMETHING TO
CONCEAL."

HE PERFECTLY AGREED WITH HER: AND AFTER WALKING TOGETHER SO LONG, AND
THINKING SO MUCH ALIKE, EMMA FELT HERSELF SO WELL ACQUAINTED WITH HIM,
THAT SHE COULD HARDLY BELIEVE IT TO BE ONLY THEIR SECOND MEETING. HE WAS
NOT EXACTLY WHAT SHE HAD EXPECTED; LESS OF THE MAN OF THE WORLD IN SOME
OF HIS NOTIONS, LESS OF THE SPOILED CHILD OF FORTUNE, THEREFORE BETTER
THAN SHE HAD EXPECTED. HIS IDEAS SEEMED MORE MODERATE--HIS FEELINGS
WARMER. SHE WAS PARTICULARLY STRUCK BY HIS MANNER OF CONSIDERING MR.
ELTON'S HOUSE, WHICH, AS WELL AS THE CHURCH, HE WOULD GO AND LOOK AT,
AND WOULD NOT JOIN THEM IN FINDING MUCH FAULT WITH. NO, HE COULD NOT
BELIEVE IT A BAD HOUSE; NOT SUCH A HOUSE AS A MAN WAS TO BE PITIED FOR
HAVING. IF IT WERE TO BE SHARED WITH THE WOMAN HE LOVED, HE COULD NOT
THINK ANY MAN TO BE PITIED FOR HAVING THAT HOUSE. THERE MUST BE AMPLE
ROOM IN IT FOR EVERY REAL COMFORT. THE MAN MUST BE A BLOCKHEAD WHO
WANTED MORE.

MRS. WESTON LAUGHED, AND SAID HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT.
USED ONLY TO A LARGE HOUSE HIMSELF, AND WITHOUT EVER THINKING HOW MANY
ADVANTAGES AND ACCOMMODATIONS WERE ATTACHED TO ITS SIZE, HE COULD BE NO
JUDGE OF THE PRIVATIONS INEVITABLY BELONGING TO A SMALL ONE. BUT EMMA,
IN HER OWN MIND, DETERMINED THAT HE DID KNOW WHAT HE WAS TALKING
ABOUT, AND THAT HE SHEWED A VERY AMIABLE INCLINATION TO SETTLE EARLY IN
LIFE, AND TO MARRY, FROM WORTHY MOTIVES. HE MIGHT NOT BE AWARE OF THE
INROADS ON DOMESTIC PEACE TO BE OCCASIONED BY NO HOUSEKEEPER'S ROOM, OR
A BAD BUTLER'S PANTRY, BUT NO DOUBT HE DID PERFECTLY FEEL THAT ENSCOMBE
COULD NOT MAKE HIM HAPPY, AND THAT WHENEVER HE WERE ATTACHED, HE WOULD
WILLINGLY GIVE UP MUCH OF WEALTH TO BE ALLOWED AN EARLY ESTABLISHMENT.



CHAPTER VII


EMMA'S VERY GOOD OPINION OF FRANK CHURCHILL WAS A LITTLE SHAKEN THE
FOLLOWING DAY, BY HEARING THAT HE WAS GONE OFF TO LONDON, MERELY TO HAVE
HIS HAIR CUT. A SUDDEN FREAK SEEMED TO HAVE SEIZED HIM AT BREAKFAST, AND
HE HAD SENT FOR A CHAISE AND SET OFF, INTENDING TO RETURN TO DINNER,
BUT WITH NO MORE IMPORTANT VIEW THAT APPEARED THAN HAVING HIS HAIR CUT.
THERE WAS CERTAINLY NO HARM IN HIS TRAVELLING SIXTEEN MILES TWICE OVER
ON SUCH AN ERRAND; BUT THERE WAS AN AIR OF FOPPERY AND NONSENSE IN IT
WHICH SHE COULD NOT APPROVE. IT DID NOT ACCORD WITH THE RATIONALITY OF
PLAN, THE MODERATION IN EXPENSE, OR EVEN THE UNSELFISH WARMTH OF HEART,
WHICH SHE HAD BELIEVED HERSELF TO DISCERN IN HIM YESTERDAY. VANITY,
EXTRAVAGANCE, LOVE OF CHANGE, RESTLESSNESS OF TEMPER, WHICH MUST BE
DOING SOMETHING, GOOD OR BAD; HEEDLESSNESS AS TO THE PLEASURE OF HIS
FATHER AND MRS. WESTON, INDIFFERENT AS TO HOW HIS CONDUCT MIGHT APPEAR
IN GENERAL; HE BECAME LIABLE TO ALL THESE CHARGES. HIS FATHER ONLY
CALLED HIM A COXCOMB, AND THOUGHT IT A VERY GOOD STORY; BUT THAT MRS.
WESTON DID NOT LIKE IT, WAS CLEAR ENOUGH, BY HER PASSING IT OVER AS
QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE, AND MAKING NO OTHER COMMENT THAN THAT "ALL YOUNG
PEOPLE WOULD HAVE THEIR LITTLE WHIMS."

WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THIS LITTLE BLOT, EMMA FOUND THAT HIS VISIT
HITHERTO HAD GIVEN HER FRIEND ONLY GOOD IDEAS OF HIM. MRS. WESTON
WAS VERY READY TO SAY HOW ATTENTIVE AND PLEASANT A COMPANION HE MADE
HIMSELF--HOW MUCH SHE SAW TO LIKE IN HIS DISPOSITION ALTOGETHER. HE
APPEARED TO HAVE A VERY OPEN TEMPER--CERTAINLY A VERY CHEERFUL AND
LIVELY ONE; SHE COULD OBSERVE NOTHING WRONG IN HIS NOTIONS, A GREAT DEAL
DECIDEDLY RIGHT; HE SPOKE OF HIS UNCLE WITH WARM REGARD, WAS FOND OF
TALKING OF HIM--SAID HE WOULD BE THE BEST MAN IN THE WORLD IF HE WERE
LEFT TO HIMSELF; AND THOUGH THERE WAS NO BEING ATTACHED TO THE AUNT, HE
ACKNOWLEDGED HER KINDNESS WITH GRATITUDE, AND SEEMED TO MEAN ALWAYS TO
SPEAK OF HER WITH RESPECT. THIS WAS ALL VERY PROMISING; AND, BUT FOR
SUCH AN UNFORTUNATE FANCY FOR HAVING HIS HAIR CUT, THERE WAS NOTHING TO
DENOTE HIM UNWORTHY OF THE DISTINGUISHED HONOUR WHICH HER IMAGINATION
HAD GIVEN HIM; THE HONOUR, IF NOT OF BEING REALLY IN LOVE WITH HER,
OF BEING AT LEAST VERY NEAR IT, AND SAVED ONLY BY HER OWN
INDIFFERENCE--(FOR STILL HER RESOLUTION HELD OF NEVER MARRYING)--THE
HONOUR, IN SHORT, OF BEING MARKED OUT FOR HER BY ALL THEIR JOINT
ACQUAINTANCE.

MR. WESTON, ON HIS SIDE, ADDED A VIRTUE TO THE ACCOUNT WHICH MUST
HAVE SOME WEIGHT. HE GAVE HER TO UNDERSTAND THAT FRANK ADMIRED HER
EXTREMELY--THOUGHT HER VERY BEAUTIFUL AND VERY CHARMING; AND WITH SO
MUCH TO BE SAID FOR HIM ALTOGETHER, SHE FOUND SHE MUST NOT JUDGE HIM
HARSHLY. AS MRS. WESTON OBSERVED, "ALL YOUNG PEOPLE WOULD HAVE THEIR
LITTLE WHIMS."

THERE WAS ONE PERSON AMONG HIS NEW ACQUAINTANCE IN SURRY, NOT SO
LENIENTLY DISPOSED. IN GENERAL HE WAS JUDGED, THROUGHOUT THE PARISHES OF
DONWELL AND HIGHBURY, WITH GREAT CANDOUR; LIBERAL ALLOWANCES WERE MADE
FOR THE LITTLE EXCESSES OF SUCH A HANDSOME YOUNG MAN--ONE WHO SMILED SO
OFTEN AND BOWED SO WELL; BUT THERE WAS ONE SPIRIT AMONG THEM NOT TO BE
SOFTENED, FROM ITS POWER OF CENSURE, BY BOWS OR SMILES--MR. KNIGHTLEY.
THE CIRCUMSTANCE WAS TOLD HIM AT HARTFIELD; FOR THE MOMENT, HE WAS
SILENT; BUT EMMA HEARD HIM ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS SAY TO HIMSELF,
OVER A NEWSPAPER HE HELD IN HIS HAND, "HUM! JUST THE TRIFLING, SILLY
FELLOW I TOOK HIM FOR." SHE HAD HALF A MIND TO RESENT; BUT AN INSTANT'S
OBSERVATION CONVINCED HER THAT IT WAS REALLY SAID ONLY TO RELIEVE HIS
OWN FEELINGS, AND NOT MEANT TO PROVOKE; AND THEREFORE SHE LET IT PASS.

ALTHOUGH IN ONE INSTANCE THE BEARERS OF NOT GOOD TIDINGS, MR. AND
MRS. WESTON'S VISIT THIS MORNING WAS IN ANOTHER RESPECT PARTICULARLY
OPPORTUNE. SOMETHING OCCURRED WHILE THEY WERE AT HARTFIELD, TO MAKE EMMA
WANT THEIR ADVICE; AND, WHICH WAS STILL MORE LUCKY, SHE WANTED EXACTLY
THE ADVICE THEY GAVE.

THIS WAS THE OCCURRENCE:--THE COLES HAD BEEN SETTLED SOME YEARS IN
HIGHBURY, AND WERE VERY GOOD SORT OF PEOPLE--FRIENDLY, LIBERAL, AND
UNPRETENDING; BUT, ON THE OTHER HAND, THEY WERE OF LOW ORIGIN, IN TRADE,
AND ONLY MODERATELY GENTEEL. ON THEIR FIRST COMING INTO THE COUNTRY,
THEY HAD LIVED IN PROPORTION TO THEIR INCOME, QUIETLY, KEEPING LITTLE
COMPANY, AND THAT LITTLE UNEXPENSIVELY; BUT THE LAST YEAR OR TWO HAD
BROUGHT THEM A CONSIDERABLE INCREASE OF MEANS--THE HOUSE IN TOWN HAD
YIELDED GREATER PROFITS, AND FORTUNE IN GENERAL HAD SMILED ON THEM. WITH
THEIR WEALTH, THEIR VIEWS INCREASED; THEIR WANT OF A LARGER HOUSE, THEIR
INCLINATION FOR MORE COMPANY. THEY ADDED TO THEIR HOUSE, TO THEIR NUMBER
OF SERVANTS, TO THEIR EXPENSES OF EVERY SORT; AND BY THIS TIME WERE,
IN FORTUNE AND STYLE OF LIVING, SECOND ONLY TO THE FAMILY AT HARTFIELD.
THEIR LOVE OF SOCIETY, AND THEIR NEW DINING-ROOM, PREPARED EVERY BODY
FOR THEIR KEEPING DINNER-COMPANY; AND A FEW PARTIES, CHIEFLY AMONG THE
SINGLE MEN, HAD ALREADY TAKEN PLACE. THE REGULAR AND BEST FAMILIES EMMA
COULD HARDLY SUPPOSE THEY WOULD PRESUME TO INVITE--NEITHER DONWELL, NOR
HARTFIELD, NOR RANDALLS. NOTHING SHOULD TEMPT HER TO GO, IF THEY DID;
AND SHE REGRETTED THAT HER FATHER'S KNOWN HABITS WOULD BE GIVING
HER REFUSAL LESS MEANING THAN SHE COULD WISH. THE COLES WERE VERY
RESPECTABLE IN THEIR WAY, BUT THEY OUGHT TO BE TAUGHT THAT IT WAS NOT
FOR THEM TO ARRANGE THE TERMS ON WHICH THE SUPERIOR FAMILIES WOULD VISIT
THEM. THIS LESSON, SHE VERY MUCH FEARED, THEY WOULD RECEIVE ONLY FROM
HERSELF; SHE HAD LITTLE HOPE OF MR. KNIGHTLEY, NONE OF MR. WESTON.

BUT SHE HAD MADE UP HER MIND HOW TO MEET THIS PRESUMPTION SO MANY WEEKS
BEFORE IT APPEARED, THAT WHEN THE INSULT CAME AT LAST, IT FOUND HER
VERY DIFFERENTLY AFFECTED. DONWELL AND RANDALLS HAD RECEIVED THEIR
INVITATION, AND NONE HAD COME FOR HER FATHER AND HERSELF; AND MRS.
WESTON'S ACCOUNTING FOR IT WITH "I SUPPOSE THEY WILL NOT TAKE THE
LIBERTY WITH YOU; THEY KNOW YOU DO NOT DINE OUT," WAS NOT QUITE
SUFFICIENT. SHE FELT THAT SHE SHOULD LIKE TO HAVE HAD THE POWER OF
REFUSAL; AND AFTERWARDS, AS THE IDEA OF THE PARTY TO BE ASSEMBLED THERE,
CONSISTING PRECISELY OF THOSE WHOSE SOCIETY WAS DEAREST TO HER, OCCURRED
AGAIN AND AGAIN, SHE DID NOT KNOW THAT SHE MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN TEMPTED
TO ACCEPT. HARRIET WAS TO BE THERE IN THE EVENING, AND THE BATESES. THEY
HAD BEEN SPEAKING OF IT AS THEY WALKED ABOUT HIGHBURY THE DAY BEFORE,
AND FRANK CHURCHILL HAD MOST EARNESTLY LAMENTED HER ABSENCE. MIGHT
NOT THE EVENING END IN A DANCE? HAD BEEN A QUESTION OF HIS. THE BARE
POSSIBILITY OF IT ACTED AS A FARTHER IRRITATION ON HER SPIRITS; AND
HER BEING LEFT IN SOLITARY GRANDEUR, EVEN SUPPOSING THE OMISSION TO BE
INTENDED AS A COMPLIMENT, WAS BUT POOR COMFORT.

IT WAS THE ARRIVAL OF THIS VERY INVITATION WHILE THE WESTONS WERE AT
HARTFIELD, WHICH MADE THEIR PRESENCE SO ACCEPTABLE; FOR THOUGH HER FIRST
REMARK, ON READING IT, WAS THAT "OF COURSE IT MUST BE DECLINED," SHE SO
VERY SOON PROCEEDED TO ASK THEM WHAT THEY ADVISED HER TO DO, THAT THEIR
ADVICE FOR HER GOING WAS MOST PROMPT AND SUCCESSFUL.

SHE OWNED THAT, CONSIDERING EVERY THING, SHE WAS NOT ABSOLUTELY
WITHOUT INCLINATION FOR THE PARTY. THE COLES EXPRESSED THEMSELVES SO
PROPERLY--THERE WAS SO MUCH REAL ATTENTION IN THE MANNER OF IT--SO MUCH
CONSIDERATION FOR HER FATHER. "THEY WOULD HAVE SOLICITED THE HONOUR
EARLIER, BUT HAD BEEN WAITING THE ARRIVAL OF A FOLDING-SCREEN FROM
LONDON, WHICH THEY HOPED MIGHT KEEP MR. WOODHOUSE FROM ANY DRAUGHT OF
AIR, AND THEREFORE INDUCE HIM THE MORE READILY TO GIVE THEM THE HONOUR
OF HIS COMPANY." UPON THE WHOLE, SHE WAS VERY PERSUADABLE; AND IT BEING
BRIEFLY SETTLED AMONG THEMSELVES HOW IT MIGHT BE DONE WITHOUT NEGLECTING
HIS COMFORT--HOW CERTAINLY MRS. GODDARD, IF NOT MRS. BATES, MIGHT BE
DEPENDED ON FOR BEARING HIM COMPANY--MR. WOODHOUSE WAS TO BE TALKED
INTO AN ACQUIESCENCE OF HIS DAUGHTER'S GOING OUT TO DINNER ON A DAY NOW
NEAR AT HAND, AND SPENDING THE WHOLE EVENING AWAY FROM HIM. AS FOR HIS
GOING, EMMA DID NOT WISH HIM TO THINK IT POSSIBLE, THE HOURS WOULD BE
TOO LATE, AND THE PARTY TOO NUMEROUS. HE WAS SOON PRETTY WELL RESIGNED.

"I AM NOT FOND OF DINNER-VISITING," SAID HE--"I NEVER WAS. NO MORE IS
EMMA. LATE HOURS DO NOT AGREE WITH US. I AM SORRY MR. AND MRS. COLE
SHOULD HAVE DONE IT. I THINK IT WOULD BE MUCH BETTER IF THEY WOULD COME
IN ONE AFTERNOON NEXT SUMMER, AND TAKE THEIR TEA WITH US--TAKE US
IN THEIR AFTERNOON WALK; WHICH THEY MIGHT DO, AS OUR HOURS ARE SO
REASONABLE, AND YET GET HOME WITHOUT BEING OUT IN THE DAMP OF THE
EVENING. THE DEWS OF A SUMMER EVENING ARE WHAT I WOULD NOT EXPOSE ANY
BODY TO. HOWEVER, AS THEY ARE SO VERY DESIROUS TO HAVE DEAR EMMA DINE
WITH THEM, AND AS YOU WILL BOTH BE THERE, AND MR. KNIGHTLEY TOO, TO TAKE
CARE OF HER, I CANNOT WISH TO PREVENT IT, PROVIDED THE WEATHER BE WHAT
IT OUGHT, NEITHER DAMP, NOR COLD, NOR WINDY." THEN TURNING TO MRS.
WESTON, WITH A LOOK OF GENTLE REPROACH--"AH! MISS TAYLOR, IF YOU HAD NOT
MARRIED, YOU WOULD HAVE STAID AT HOME WITH ME."

"WELL, SIR," CRIED MR. WESTON, "AS I TOOK MISS TAYLOR AWAY, IT IS
INCUMBENT ON ME TO SUPPLY HER PLACE, IF I CAN; AND I WILL STEP TO MRS.
GODDARD IN A MOMENT, IF YOU WISH IT."

BUT THE IDEA OF ANY THING TO BE DONE IN A MOMENT, WAS INCREASING,
NOT LESSENING, MR. WOODHOUSE'S AGITATION. THE LADIES KNEW BETTER HOW
TO ALLAY IT. MR. WESTON MUST BE QUIET, AND EVERY THING DELIBERATELY
ARRANGED.

WITH THIS TREATMENT, MR. WOODHOUSE WAS SOON COMPOSED ENOUGH FOR TALKING
AS USUAL. "HE SHOULD BE HAPPY TO SEE MRS. GODDARD. HE HAD A GREAT REGARD
FOR MRS. GODDARD; AND EMMA SHOULD WRITE A LINE, AND INVITE HER. JAMES
COULD TAKE THE NOTE. BUT FIRST OF ALL, THERE MUST BE AN ANSWER WRITTEN
TO MRS. COLE."

"YOU WILL MAKE MY EXCUSES, MY DEAR, AS CIVILLY AS POSSIBLE. YOU WILL SAY
THAT I AM QUITE AN INVALID, AND GO NO WHERE, AND THEREFORE MUST DECLINE
THEIR OBLIGING INVITATION; BEGINNING WITH MY COMPLIMENTS, OF COURSE.
BUT YOU WILL DO EVERY THING RIGHT. I NEED NOT TELL YOU WHAT IS TO BE
DONE. WE MUST REMEMBER TO LET JAMES KNOW THAT THE CARRIAGE WILL BE
WANTED ON TUESDAY. I SHALL HAVE NO FEARS FOR YOU WITH HIM. WE HAVE NEVER
BEEN THERE ABOVE ONCE SINCE THE NEW APPROACH WAS MADE; BUT STILL I HAVE
NO DOUBT THAT JAMES WILL TAKE YOU VERY SAFELY. AND WHEN YOU GET THERE,
YOU MUST TELL HIM AT WHAT TIME YOU WOULD HAVE HIM COME FOR YOU AGAIN;
AND YOU HAD BETTER NAME AN EARLY HOUR. YOU WILL NOT LIKE STAYING LATE.
YOU WILL GET VERY TIRED WHEN TEA IS OVER."

"BUT YOU WOULD NOT WISH ME TO COME AWAY BEFORE I AM TIRED, PAPA?"

"OH! NO, MY LOVE; BUT YOU WILL SOON BE TIRED. THERE WILL BE A GREAT MANY
PEOPLE TALKING AT ONCE. YOU WILL NOT LIKE THE NOISE."

"BUT, MY DEAR SIR," CRIED MR. WESTON, "IF EMMA COMES AWAY EARLY, IT WILL
BE BREAKING UP THE PARTY."

"AND NO GREAT HARM IF IT DOES," SAID MR. WOODHOUSE. "THE SOONER EVERY
PARTY BREAKS UP, THE BETTER."

"BUT YOU DO NOT CONSIDER HOW IT MAY APPEAR TO THE COLES. EMMA'S GOING
AWAY DIRECTLY AFTER TEA MIGHT BE GIVING OFFENCE. THEY ARE GOOD-NATURED
PEOPLE, AND THINK LITTLE OF THEIR OWN CLAIMS; BUT STILL THEY MUST
FEEL THAT ANY BODY'S HURRYING AWAY IS NO GREAT COMPLIMENT; AND MISS
WOODHOUSE'S DOING IT WOULD BE MORE THOUGHT OF THAN ANY OTHER PERSON'S IN
THE ROOM. YOU WOULD NOT WISH TO DISAPPOINT AND MORTIFY THE COLES, I AM
SURE, SIR; FRIENDLY, GOOD SORT OF PEOPLE AS EVER LIVED, AND WHO HAVE
BEEN YOUR NEIGHBOURS THESE TEN YEARS."

"NO, UPON NO ACCOUNT IN THE WORLD, MR. WESTON; I AM MUCH OBLIGED TO
YOU FOR REMINDING ME. I SHOULD BE EXTREMELY SORRY TO BE GIVING THEM ANY
PAIN. I KNOW WHAT WORTHY PEOPLE THEY ARE. PERRY TELLS ME THAT MR. COLE
NEVER TOUCHES MALT LIQUOR. YOU WOULD NOT THINK IT TO LOOK AT HIM, BUT
HE IS BILIOUS--MR. COLE IS VERY BILIOUS. NO, I WOULD NOT BE THE MEANS
OF GIVING THEM ANY PAIN. MY DEAR EMMA, WE MUST CONSIDER THIS. I AM SURE,
RATHER THAN RUN THE RISK OF HURTING MR. AND MRS. COLE, YOU WOULD STAY A
LITTLE LONGER THAN YOU MIGHT WISH. YOU WILL NOT REGARD BEING TIRED. YOU
WILL BE PERFECTLY SAFE, YOU KNOW, AMONG YOUR FRIENDS."

"OH YES, PAPA. I HAVE NO FEARS AT ALL FOR MYSELF; AND I SHOULD HAVE NO
SCRUPLES OF STAYING AS LATE AS MRS. WESTON, BUT ON YOUR ACCOUNT. I AM
ONLY AFRAID OF YOUR SITTING UP FOR ME. I AM NOT AFRAID OF YOUR NOT BEING
EXCEEDINGLY COMFORTABLE WITH MRS. GODDARD. SHE LOVES PIQUET, YOU
KNOW; BUT WHEN SHE IS GONE HOME, I AM AFRAID YOU WILL BE SITTING UP BY
YOURSELF, INSTEAD OF GOING TO BED AT YOUR USUAL TIME--AND THE IDEA OF
THAT WOULD ENTIRELY DESTROY MY COMFORT. YOU MUST PROMISE ME NOT TO SIT
UP."

HE DID, ON THE CONDITION OF SOME PROMISES ON HER SIDE: SUCH AS THAT,
IF SHE CAME HOME COLD, SHE WOULD BE SURE TO WARM HERSELF THOROUGHLY; IF
HUNGRY, THAT SHE WOULD TAKE SOMETHING TO EAT; THAT HER OWN MAID SHOULD
SIT UP FOR HER; AND THAT SERLE AND THE BUTLER SHOULD SEE THAT EVERY
THING WERE SAFE IN THE HOUSE, AS USUAL.



CHAPTER VIII


FRANK CHURCHILL CAME BACK AGAIN; AND IF HE KEPT HIS FATHER'S DINNER
WAITING, IT WAS NOT KNOWN AT HARTFIELD; FOR MRS. WESTON WAS TOO ANXIOUS
FOR HIS BEING A FAVOURITE WITH MR. WOODHOUSE, TO BETRAY ANY IMPERFECTION
WHICH COULD BE CONCEALED.

HE CAME BACK, HAD HAD HIS HAIR CUT, AND LAUGHED AT HIMSELF WITH A VERY
GOOD GRACE, BUT WITHOUT SEEMING REALLY AT ALL ASHAMED OF WHAT HE HAD
DONE. HE HAD NO REASON TO WISH HIS HAIR LONGER, TO CONCEAL ANY CONFUSION
OF FACE; NO REASON TO WISH THE MONEY UNSPENT, TO IMPROVE HIS SPIRITS.
HE WAS QUITE AS UNDAUNTED AND AS LIVELY AS EVER; AND, AFTER SEEING HIM,
EMMA THUS MORALISED TO HERSELF:--

"I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER IT OUGHT TO BE SO, BUT CERTAINLY SILLY THINGS
DO CEASE TO BE SILLY IF THEY ARE DONE BY SENSIBLE PEOPLE IN AN IMPUDENT
WAY. WICKEDNESS IS ALWAYS WICKEDNESS, BUT FOLLY IS NOT ALWAYS FOLLY.--IT
DEPENDS UPON THE CHARACTER OF THOSE WHO HANDLE IT. MR. KNIGHTLEY, HE IS
NOT A TRIFLING, SILLY YOUNG MAN. IF HE WERE, HE WOULD HAVE DONE THIS
DIFFERENTLY. HE WOULD EITHER HAVE GLORIED IN THE ACHIEVEMENT, OR
BEEN ASHAMED OF IT. THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN EITHER THE OSTENTATION OF
A COXCOMB, OR THE EVASIONS OF A MIND TOO WEAK TO DEFEND ITS OWN
VANITIES.--NO, I AM PERFECTLY SURE THAT HE IS NOT TRIFLING OR SILLY."

WITH TUESDAY CAME THE AGREEABLE PROSPECT OF SEEING HIM AGAIN, AND FOR
A LONGER TIME THAN HITHERTO; OF JUDGING OF HIS GENERAL MANNERS, AND BY
INFERENCE, OF THE MEANING OF HIS MANNERS TOWARDS HERSELF; OF GUESSING
HOW SOON IT MIGHT BE NECESSARY FOR HER TO THROW COLDNESS INTO HER AIR;
AND OF FANCYING WHAT THE OBSERVATIONS OF ALL THOSE MIGHT BE, WHO WERE
NOW SEEING THEM TOGETHER FOR THE FIRST TIME.

SHE MEANT TO BE VERY HAPPY, IN SPITE OF THE SCENE BEING LAID AT MR.
COLE'S; AND WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO FORGET THAT AMONG THE FAILINGS OF MR.
ELTON, EVEN IN THE DAYS OF HIS FAVOUR, NONE HAD DISTURBED HER MORE THAN
HIS PROPENSITY TO DINE WITH MR. COLE.

HER FATHER'S COMFORT WAS AMPLY SECURED, MRS. BATES AS WELL AS MRS.
GODDARD BEING ABLE TO COME; AND HER LAST PLEASING DUTY, BEFORE SHE LEFT
THE HOUSE, WAS TO PAY HER RESPECTS TO THEM AS THEY SAT TOGETHER AFTER
DINNER; AND WHILE HER FATHER WAS FONDLY NOTICING THE BEAUTY OF HER
DRESS, TO MAKE THE TWO LADIES ALL THE AMENDS IN HER POWER, BY HELPING
THEM TO LARGE SLICES OF CAKE AND FULL GLASSES OF WINE, FOR WHATEVER
UNWILLING SELF-DENIAL HIS CARE OF THEIR CONSTITUTION MIGHT HAVE OBLIGED
THEM TO PRACTISE DURING THE MEAL.--SHE HAD PROVIDED A PLENTIFUL DINNER
FOR THEM; SHE WISHED SHE COULD KNOW THAT THEY HAD BEEN ALLOWED TO EAT
IT.

SHE FOLLOWED ANOTHER CARRIAGE TO MR. COLE'S DOOR; AND WAS PLEASED TO SEE
THAT IT WAS MR. KNIGHTLEY'S; FOR MR. KNIGHTLEY KEEPING NO HORSES,
HAVING LITTLE SPARE MONEY AND A GREAT DEAL OF HEALTH, ACTIVITY, AND
INDEPENDENCE, WAS TOO APT, IN EMMA'S OPINION, TO GET ABOUT AS HE COULD,
AND NOT USE HIS CARRIAGE SO OFTEN AS BECAME THE OWNER OF DONWELL ABBEY.
SHE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY NOW OF SPEAKING HER APPROBATION WHILE WARM FROM
HER HEART, FOR HE STOPPED TO HAND HER OUT.

"THIS IS COMING AS YOU SHOULD DO," SAID SHE; "LIKE A GENTLEMAN.--I AM
QUITE GLAD TO SEE YOU."

HE THANKED HER, OBSERVING, "HOW LUCKY THAT WE SHOULD ARRIVE AT THE SAME
MOMENT! FOR, IF WE HAD MET FIRST IN THE DRAWING-ROOM, I DOUBT WHETHER
YOU WOULD HAVE DISCERNED ME TO BE MORE OF A GENTLEMAN THAN USUAL.--YOU
MIGHT NOT HAVE DISTINGUISHED HOW I CAME, BY MY LOOK OR MANNER."

"YES I SHOULD, I AM SURE I SHOULD. THERE IS ALWAYS A LOOK OF
CONSCIOUSNESS OR BUSTLE WHEN PEOPLE COME IN A WAY WHICH THEY KNOW TO BE
BENEATH THEM. YOU THINK YOU CARRY IT OFF VERY WELL, I DARE SAY, BUT
WITH YOU IT IS A SORT OF BRAVADO, AN AIR OF AFFECTED UNCONCERN; I ALWAYS
OBSERVE IT WHENEVER I MEET YOU UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES. NOW YOU HAVE
NOTHING TO TRY FOR. YOU ARE NOT AFRAID OF BEING SUPPOSED ASHAMED. YOU
ARE NOT STRIVING TO LOOK TALLER THAN ANY BODY ELSE. NOW I SHALL REALLY
BE VERY HAPPY TO WALK INTO THE SAME ROOM WITH YOU."

"NONSENSICAL GIRL!" WAS HIS REPLY, BUT NOT AT ALL IN ANGER.

EMMA HAD AS MUCH REASON TO BE SATISFIED WITH THE REST OF THE PARTY AS
WITH MR. KNIGHTLEY. SHE WAS RECEIVED WITH A CORDIAL RESPECT WHICH COULD
NOT BUT PLEASE, AND GIVEN ALL THE CONSEQUENCE SHE COULD WISH FOR.
WHEN THE WESTONS ARRIVED, THE KINDEST LOOKS OF LOVE, THE STRONGEST OF
ADMIRATION WERE FOR HER, FROM BOTH HUSBAND AND WIFE; THE SON APPROACHED
HER WITH A CHEERFUL EAGERNESS WHICH MARKED HER AS HIS PECULIAR OBJECT,
AND AT DINNER SHE FOUND HIM SEATED BY HER--AND, AS SHE FIRMLY BELIEVED,
NOT WITHOUT SOME DEXTERITY ON HIS SIDE.

THE PARTY WAS RATHER LARGE, AS IT INCLUDED ONE OTHER FAMILY, A PROPER
UNOBJECTIONABLE COUNTRY FAMILY, WHOM THE COLES HAD THE ADVANTAGE OF
NAMING AMONG THEIR ACQUAINTANCE, AND THE MALE PART OF MR. COX'S FAMILY,
THE LAWYER OF HIGHBURY. THE LESS WORTHY FEMALES WERE TO COME IN THE
EVENING, WITH MISS BATES, MISS FAIRFAX, AND MISS SMITH; BUT ALREADY,
AT DINNER, THEY WERE TOO NUMEROUS FOR ANY SUBJECT OF CONVERSATION TO BE
GENERAL; AND, WHILE POLITICS AND MR. ELTON WERE TALKED OVER, EMMA COULD
FAIRLY SURRENDER ALL HER ATTENTION TO THE PLEASANTNESS OF HER NEIGHBOUR.
THE FIRST REMOTE SOUND TO WHICH SHE FELT HERSELF OBLIGED TO ATTEND, WAS
THE NAME OF JANE FAIRFAX. MRS. COLE SEEMED TO BE RELATING SOMETHING OF
HER THAT WAS EXPECTED TO BE VERY INTERESTING. SHE LISTENED, AND FOUND
IT WELL WORTH LISTENING TO. THAT VERY DEAR PART OF EMMA, HER FANCY,
RECEIVED AN AMUSING SUPPLY. MRS. COLE WAS TELLING THAT SHE HAD BEEN
CALLING ON MISS BATES, AND AS SOON AS SHE ENTERED THE ROOM HAD
BEEN STRUCK BY THE SIGHT OF A PIANOFORTE--A VERY ELEGANT LOOKING
INSTRUMENT--NOT A GRAND, BUT A LARGE-SIZED SQUARE PIANOFORTE; AND THE
SUBSTANCE OF THE STORY, THE END OF ALL THE DIALOGUE WHICH ENSUED OF
SURPRIZE, AND INQUIRY, AND CONGRATULATIONS ON HER SIDE, AND EXPLANATIONS
ON MISS BATES'S, WAS, THAT THIS PIANOFORTE HAD ARRIVED FROM
BROADWOOD'S THE DAY BEFORE, TO THE GREAT ASTONISHMENT OF BOTH AUNT AND
NIECE--ENTIRELY UNEXPECTED; THAT AT FIRST, BY MISS BATES'S ACCOUNT,
JANE HERSELF WAS QUITE AT A LOSS, QUITE BEWILDERED TO THINK WHO COULD
POSSIBLY HAVE ORDERED IT--BUT NOW, THEY WERE BOTH PERFECTLY SATISFIED
THAT IT COULD BE FROM ONLY ONE QUARTER;--OF COURSE IT MUST BE FROM
COLONEL CAMPBELL.

"ONE CAN SUPPOSE NOTHING ELSE," ADDED MRS. COLE, "AND I WAS ONLY
SURPRIZED THAT THERE COULD EVER HAVE BEEN A DOUBT. BUT JANE, IT SEEMS,
HAD A LETTER FROM THEM VERY LATELY, AND NOT A WORD WAS SAID ABOUT IT.
SHE KNOWS THEIR WAYS BEST; BUT I SHOULD NOT CONSIDER THEIR SILENCE AS
ANY REASON FOR THEIR NOT MEANING TO MAKE THE PRESENT. THEY MIGHT CHUSE
TO SURPRIZE HER."

MRS. COLE HAD MANY TO AGREE WITH HER; EVERY BODY WHO SPOKE ON THE
SUBJECT WAS EQUALLY CONVINCED THAT IT MUST COME FROM COLONEL CAMPBELL,
AND EQUALLY REJOICED THAT SUCH A PRESENT HAD BEEN MADE; AND THERE WERE
ENOUGH READY TO SPEAK TO ALLOW EMMA TO THINK HER OWN WAY, AND STILL
LISTEN TO MRS. COLE.

"I DECLARE, I DO NOT KNOW WHEN I HAVE HEARD ANY THING THAT HAS GIVEN ME
MORE SATISFACTION!--IT ALWAYS HAS QUITE HURT ME THAT JANE FAIRFAX, WHO
PLAYS SO DELIGHTFULLY, SHOULD NOT HAVE AN INSTRUMENT. IT SEEMED QUITE
A SHAME, ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING HOW MANY HOUSES THERE ARE WHERE FINE
INSTRUMENTS ARE ABSOLUTELY THROWN AWAY. THIS IS LIKE GIVING OURSELVES
A SLAP, TO BE SURE! AND IT WAS BUT YESTERDAY I WAS TELLING MR. COLE,
I REALLY WAS ASHAMED TO LOOK AT OUR NEW GRAND PIANOFORTE IN THE
DRAWING-ROOM, WHILE I DO NOT KNOW ONE NOTE FROM ANOTHER, AND OUR LITTLE
GIRLS, WHO ARE BUT JUST BEGINNING, PERHAPS MAY NEVER MAKE ANY THING OF
IT; AND THERE IS POOR JANE FAIRFAX, WHO IS MISTRESS OF MUSIC, HAS NOT
ANY THING OF THE NATURE OF AN INSTRUMENT, NOT EVEN THE PITIFULLEST OLD
SPINET IN THE WORLD, TO AMUSE HERSELF WITH.--I WAS SAYING THIS TO
MR. COLE BUT YESTERDAY, AND HE QUITE AGREED WITH ME; ONLY HE IS SO
PARTICULARLY FOND OF MUSIC THAT HE COULD NOT HELP INDULGING HIMSELF
IN THE PURCHASE, HOPING THAT SOME OF OUR GOOD NEIGHBOURS MIGHT BE SO
OBLIGING OCCASIONALLY TO PUT IT TO A BETTER USE THAN WE CAN; AND THAT
REALLY IS THE REASON WHY THE INSTRUMENT WAS BOUGHT--OR ELSE I AM SURE
WE OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED OF IT.--WE ARE IN GREAT HOPES THAT MISS WOODHOUSE
MAY BE PREVAILED WITH TO TRY IT THIS EVENING."

MISS WOODHOUSE MADE THE PROPER ACQUIESCENCE; AND FINDING THAT NOTHING
MORE WAS TO BE ENTRAPPED FROM ANY COMMUNICATION OF MRS. COLE'S, TURNED
TO FRANK CHURCHILL.

"WHY DO YOU SMILE?" SAID SHE.

"NAY, WHY DO YOU?"

"ME!--I SUPPOSE I SMILE FOR PLEASURE AT COLONEL CAMPBELL'S BEING SO RICH
AND SO LIBERAL.--IT IS A HANDSOME PRESENT."

"VERY."

"I RATHER WONDER THAT IT WAS NEVER MADE BEFORE."

"PERHAPS MISS FAIRFAX HAS NEVER BEEN STAYING HERE SO LONG BEFORE."

"OR THAT HE DID NOT GIVE HER THE USE OF THEIR OWN INSTRUMENT--WHICH MUST
NOW BE SHUT UP IN LONDON, UNTOUCHED BY ANY BODY."

"THAT IS A GRAND PIANOFORTE, AND HE MIGHT THINK IT TOO LARGE FOR MRS.
BATES'S HOUSE."

"YOU MAY SAY WHAT YOU CHUSE--BUT YOUR COUNTENANCE TESTIFIES THAT YOUR
THOUGHTS ON THIS SUBJECT ARE VERY MUCH LIKE MINE."

"I DO NOT KNOW. I RATHER BELIEVE YOU ARE GIVING ME MORE CREDIT FOR
ACUTENESS THAN I DESERVE. I SMILE BECAUSE YOU SMILE, AND SHALL PROBABLY
SUSPECT WHATEVER I FIND YOU SUSPECT; BUT AT PRESENT I DO NOT SEE WHAT
THERE IS TO QUESTION. IF COLONEL CAMPBELL IS NOT THE PERSON, WHO CAN
BE?"

"WHAT DO YOU SAY TO MRS. DIXON?"

"MRS. DIXON! VERY TRUE INDEED. I HAD NOT THOUGHT OF MRS. DIXON. SHE MUST
KNOW AS WELL AS HER FATHER, HOW ACCEPTABLE AN INSTRUMENT WOULD BE; AND
PERHAPS THE MODE OF IT, THE MYSTERY, THE SURPRIZE, IS MORE LIKE A YOUNG
WOMAN'S SCHEME THAN AN ELDERLY MAN'S. IT IS MRS. DIXON, I DARE SAY. I
TOLD YOU THAT YOUR SUSPICIONS WOULD GUIDE MINE."

"IF SO, YOU MUST EXTEND YOUR SUSPICIONS AND COMPREHEND MR. DIXON IN
THEM."

"MR. DIXON.--VERY WELL. YES, I IMMEDIATELY PERCEIVE THAT IT MUST BE THE
JOINT PRESENT OF MR. AND MRS. DIXON. WE WERE SPEAKING THE OTHER DAY, YOU
KNOW, OF HIS BEING SO WARM AN ADMIRER OF HER PERFORMANCE."

"YES, AND WHAT YOU TOLD ME ON THAT HEAD, CONFIRMED AN IDEA WHICH I HAD
ENTERTAINED BEFORE.--I DO NOT MEAN TO REFLECT UPON THE GOOD INTENTIONS
OF EITHER MR. DIXON OR MISS FAIRFAX, BUT I CANNOT HELP SUSPECTING EITHER
THAT, AFTER MAKING HIS PROPOSALS TO HER FRIEND, HE HAD THE MISFORTUNE
TO FALL IN LOVE WITH HER, OR THAT HE BECAME CONSCIOUS OF A LITTLE
ATTACHMENT ON HER SIDE. ONE MIGHT GUESS TWENTY THINGS WITHOUT GUESSING
EXACTLY THE RIGHT; BUT I AM SURE THERE MUST BE A PARTICULAR CAUSE FOR
HER CHUSING TO COME TO HIGHBURY INSTEAD OF GOING WITH THE CAMPBELLS
TO IRELAND. HERE, SHE MUST BE LEADING A LIFE OF PRIVATION AND PENANCE;
THERE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN ALL ENJOYMENT. AS TO THE PRETENCE OF TRYING HER
NATIVE AIR, I LOOK UPON THAT AS A MERE EXCUSE.--IN THE SUMMER IT MIGHT
HAVE PASSED; BUT WHAT CAN ANY BODY'S NATIVE AIR DO FOR THEM IN THE
MONTHS OF JANUARY, FEBRUARY, AND MARCH? GOOD FIRES AND CARRIAGES WOULD
BE MUCH MORE TO THE PURPOSE IN MOST CASES OF DELICATE HEALTH, AND I DARE
SAY IN HER'S. I DO NOT REQUIRE YOU TO ADOPT ALL MY SUSPICIONS, THOUGH
YOU MAKE SO NOBLE A PROFESSION OF DOING IT, BUT I HONESTLY TELL YOU WHAT
THEY ARE."

"AND, UPON MY WORD, THEY HAVE AN AIR OF GREAT PROBABILITY. MR. DIXON'S
PREFERENCE OF HER MUSIC TO HER FRIEND'S, I CAN ANSWER FOR BEING VERY
DECIDED."

"AND THEN, HE SAVED HER LIFE. DID YOU EVER HEAR OF THAT?--A WATER
PARTY; AND BY SOME ACCIDENT SHE WAS FALLING OVERBOARD. HE CAUGHT HER."

"HE DID. I WAS THERE--ONE OF THE PARTY."

"WERE YOU REALLY?--WELL!--BUT YOU OBSERVED NOTHING OF COURSE, FOR IT
SEEMS TO BE A NEW IDEA TO YOU.--IF I HAD BEEN THERE, I THINK I SHOULD
HAVE MADE SOME DISCOVERIES."

"I DARE SAY YOU WOULD; BUT I, SIMPLE I, SAW NOTHING BUT THE FACT, THAT
MISS FAIRFAX WAS NEARLY DASHED FROM THE VESSEL AND THAT MR. DIXON CAUGHT
HER.--IT WAS THE WORK OF A MOMENT. AND THOUGH THE CONSEQUENT SHOCK AND
ALARM WAS VERY GREAT AND MUCH MORE DURABLE--INDEED I BELIEVE IT WAS
HALF AN HOUR BEFORE ANY OF US WERE COMFORTABLE AGAIN--YET THAT WAS TOO
GENERAL A SENSATION FOR ANY THING OF PECULIAR ANXIETY TO BE
OBSERVABLE. I DO NOT MEAN TO SAY, HOWEVER, THAT YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE MADE
DISCOVERIES."

THE CONVERSATION WAS HERE INTERRUPTED. THEY WERE CALLED ON TO SHARE
IN THE AWKWARDNESS OF A RATHER LONG INTERVAL BETWEEN THE COURSES, AND
OBLIGED TO BE AS FORMAL AND AS ORDERLY AS THE OTHERS; BUT WHEN THE TABLE
WAS AGAIN SAFELY COVERED, WHEN EVERY CORNER DISH WAS PLACED EXACTLY
RIGHT, AND OCCUPATION AND EASE WERE GENERALLY RESTORED, EMMA SAID,

"THE ARRIVAL OF THIS PIANOFORTE IS DECISIVE WITH ME. I WANTED TO KNOW
A LITTLE MORE, AND THIS TELLS ME QUITE ENOUGH. DEPEND UPON IT, WE SHALL
SOON HEAR THAT IT IS A PRESENT FROM MR. AND MRS. DIXON."

"AND IF THE DIXONS SHOULD ABSOLUTELY DENY ALL KNOWLEDGE OF IT WE MUST
CONCLUDE IT TO COME FROM THE CAMPBELLS."

"NO, I AM SURE IT IS NOT FROM THE CAMPBELLS. MISS FAIRFAX KNOWS IT IS
NOT FROM THE CAMPBELLS, OR THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN GUESSED AT FIRST. SHE
WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN PUZZLED, HAD SHE DARED FIX ON THEM. I MAY NOT HAVE
CONVINCED YOU PERHAPS, BUT I AM PERFECTLY CONVINCED MYSELF THAT MR.
DIXON IS A PRINCIPAL IN THE BUSINESS."

"INDEED YOU INJURE ME IF YOU SUPPOSE ME UNCONVINCED. YOUR REASONINGS
CARRY MY JUDGMENT ALONG WITH THEM ENTIRELY. AT FIRST, WHILE I SUPPOSED
YOU SATISFIED THAT COLONEL CAMPBELL WAS THE GIVER, I SAW IT ONLY AS
PATERNAL KINDNESS, AND THOUGHT IT THE MOST NATURAL THING IN THE WORLD.
BUT WHEN YOU MENTIONED MRS. DIXON, I FELT HOW MUCH MORE PROBABLE THAT IT
SHOULD BE THE TRIBUTE OF WARM FEMALE FRIENDSHIP. AND NOW I CAN SEE IT IN
NO OTHER LIGHT THAN AS AN OFFERING OF LOVE."

THERE WAS NO OCCASION TO PRESS THE MATTER FARTHER. THE CONVICTION SEEMED
REAL; HE LOOKED AS IF HE FELT IT. SHE SAID NO MORE, OTHER SUBJECTS
TOOK THEIR TURN; AND THE REST OF THE DINNER PASSED AWAY; THE DESSERT
SUCCEEDED, THE CHILDREN CAME IN, AND WERE TALKED TO AND ADMIRED AMID THE
USUAL RATE OF CONVERSATION; A FEW CLEVER THINGS SAID, A FEW DOWNRIGHT
SILLY, BUT BY MUCH THE LARGER PROPORTION NEITHER THE ONE NOR THE
OTHER--NOTHING WORSE THAN EVERYDAY REMARKS, DULL REPETITIONS, OLD NEWS,
AND HEAVY JOKES.

THE LADIES HAD NOT BEEN LONG IN THE DRAWING-ROOM, BEFORE THE OTHER
LADIES, IN THEIR DIFFERENT DIVISIONS, ARRIVED. EMMA WATCHED THE ENTREE
OF HER OWN PARTICULAR LITTLE FRIEND; AND IF SHE COULD NOT EXULT IN HER
DIGNITY AND GRACE, SHE COULD NOT ONLY LOVE THE BLOOMING SWEETNESS AND
THE ARTLESS MANNER, BUT COULD MOST HEARTILY REJOICE IN THAT LIGHT,
CHEERFUL, UNSENTIMENTAL DISPOSITION WHICH ALLOWED HER SO MANY
ALLEVIATIONS OF PLEASURE, IN THE MIDST OF THE PANGS OF DISAPPOINTED
AFFECTION. THERE SHE SAT--AND WHO WOULD HAVE GUESSED HOW MANY TEARS SHE
HAD BEEN LATELY SHEDDING? TO BE IN COMPANY, NICELY DRESSED HERSELF AND
SEEING OTHERS NICELY DRESSED, TO SIT AND SMILE AND LOOK PRETTY, AND SAY
NOTHING, WAS ENOUGH FOR THE HAPPINESS OF THE PRESENT HOUR. JANE FAIRFAX
DID LOOK AND MOVE SUPERIOR; BUT EMMA SUSPECTED SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN
GLAD TO CHANGE FEELINGS WITH HARRIET, VERY GLAD TO HAVE PURCHASED THE
MORTIFICATION OF HAVING LOVED--YES, OF HAVING LOVED EVEN MR. ELTON IN
VAIN--BY THE SURRENDER OF ALL THE DANGEROUS PLEASURE OF KNOWING HERSELF
BELOVED BY THE HUSBAND OF HER FRIEND.

IN SO LARGE A PARTY IT WAS NOT NECESSARY THAT EMMA SHOULD APPROACH HER.
SHE DID NOT WISH TO SPEAK OF THE PIANOFORTE, SHE FELT TOO MUCH IN THE
SECRET HERSELF, TO THINK THE APPEARANCE OF CURIOSITY OR INTEREST FAIR,
AND THEREFORE PURPOSELY KEPT AT A DISTANCE; BUT BY THE OTHERS, THE
SUBJECT WAS ALMOST IMMEDIATELY INTRODUCED, AND SHE SAW THE BLUSH OF
CONSCIOUSNESS WITH WHICH CONGRATULATIONS WERE RECEIVED, THE BLUSH
OF GUILT WHICH ACCOMPANIED THE NAME OF "MY EXCELLENT FRIEND COLONEL
CAMPBELL."

MRS. WESTON, KIND-HEARTED AND MUSICAL, WAS PARTICULARLY INTERESTED
BY THE CIRCUMSTANCE, AND EMMA COULD NOT HELP BEING AMUSED AT HER
PERSEVERANCE IN DWELLING ON THE SUBJECT; AND HAVING SO MUCH TO ASK AND
TO SAY AS TO TONE, TOUCH, AND PEDAL, TOTALLY UNSUSPICIOUS OF THAT WISH
OF SAYING AS LITTLE ABOUT IT AS POSSIBLE, WHICH SHE PLAINLY READ IN THE
FAIR HEROINE'S COUNTENANCE.

THEY WERE SOON JOINED BY SOME OF THE GENTLEMEN; AND THE VERY FIRST
OF THE EARLY WAS FRANK CHURCHILL. IN HE WALKED, THE FIRST AND THE
HANDSOMEST; AND AFTER PAYING HIS COMPLIMENTS EN PASSANT TO MISS BATES
AND HER NIECE, MADE HIS WAY DIRECTLY TO THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE CIRCLE,
WHERE SAT MISS WOODHOUSE; AND TILL HE COULD FIND A SEAT BY HER, WOULD
NOT SIT AT ALL. EMMA DIVINED WHAT EVERY BODY PRESENT MUST BE THINKING.
SHE WAS HIS OBJECT, AND EVERY BODY MUST PERCEIVE IT. SHE INTRODUCED HIM
TO HER FRIEND, MISS SMITH, AND, AT CONVENIENT MOMENTS AFTERWARDS, HEARD
WHAT EACH THOUGHT OF THE OTHER. "HE HAD NEVER SEEN SO LOVELY A FACE, AND
WAS DELIGHTED WITH HER NAIVETE." AND SHE, "ONLY TO BE SURE IT WAS PAYING
HIM TOO GREAT A COMPLIMENT, BUT SHE DID THINK THERE WERE SOME LOOKS A
LITTLE LIKE MR. ELTON." EMMA RESTRAINED HER INDIGNATION, AND ONLY TURNED
FROM HER IN SILENCE.

SMILES OF INTELLIGENCE PASSED BETWEEN HER AND THE GENTLEMAN ON FIRST
GLANCING TOWARDS MISS FAIRFAX; BUT IT WAS MOST PRUDENT TO AVOID SPEECH.
HE TOLD HER THAT HE HAD BEEN IMPATIENT TO LEAVE THE DINING-ROOM--HATED
SITTING LONG--WAS ALWAYS THE FIRST TO MOVE WHEN HE COULD--THAT HIS
FATHER, MR. KNIGHTLEY, MR. COX, AND MR. COLE, WERE LEFT VERY BUSY OVER
PARISH BUSINESS--THAT AS LONG AS HE HAD STAID, HOWEVER, IT HAD BEEN
PLEASANT ENOUGH, AS HE HAD FOUND THEM IN GENERAL A SET OF GENTLEMANLIKE,
SENSIBLE MEN; AND SPOKE SO HANDSOMELY OF HIGHBURY ALTOGETHER--THOUGHT IT
SO ABUNDANT IN AGREEABLE FAMILIES--THAT EMMA BEGAN TO FEEL SHE HAD BEEN
USED TO DESPISE THE PLACE RATHER TOO MUCH. SHE QUESTIONED HIM AS TO THE
SOCIETY IN YORKSHIRE--THE EXTENT OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD ABOUT ENSCOMBE,
AND THE SORT; AND COULD MAKE OUT FROM HIS ANSWERS THAT, AS FAR AS
ENSCOMBE WAS CONCERNED, THERE WAS VERY LITTLE GOING ON, THAT THEIR
VISITINGS WERE AMONG A RANGE OF GREAT FAMILIES, NONE VERY NEAR; AND
THAT EVEN WHEN DAYS WERE FIXED, AND INVITATIONS ACCEPTED, IT WAS AN EVEN
CHANCE THAT MRS. CHURCHILL WERE NOT IN HEALTH AND SPIRITS FOR GOING;
THAT THEY MADE A POINT OF VISITING NO FRESH PERSON; AND THAT, THOUGH
HE HAD HIS SEPARATE ENGAGEMENTS, IT WAS NOT WITHOUT DIFFICULTY, WITHOUT
CONSIDERABLE ADDRESS AT TIMES, THAT HE COULD GET AWAY, OR INTRODUCE
AN ACQUAINTANCE FOR A NIGHT.

SHE SAW THAT ENSCOMBE COULD NOT SATISFY, AND THAT HIGHBURY, TAKEN AT
ITS BEST, MIGHT REASONABLY PLEASE A YOUNG MAN WHO HAD MORE RETIREMENT AT
HOME THAN HE LIKED. HIS IMPORTANCE AT ENSCOMBE WAS VERY EVIDENT. HE DID
NOT BOAST, BUT IT NATURALLY BETRAYED ITSELF, THAT HE HAD PERSUADED HIS
AUNT WHERE HIS UNCLE COULD DO NOTHING, AND ON HER LAUGHING AND NOTICING
IT, HE OWNED THAT HE BELIEVED (EXCEPTING ONE OR TWO POINTS) HE COULD
WITH TIME PERSUADE HER TO ANY THING. ONE OF THOSE POINTS ON WHICH
HIS INFLUENCE FAILED, HE THEN MENTIONED. HE HAD WANTED VERY MUCH TO
GO ABROAD--HAD BEEN VERY EAGER INDEED TO BE ALLOWED TO TRAVEL--BUT SHE
WOULD NOT HEAR OF IT. THIS HAD HAPPENED THE YEAR BEFORE. NOW, HE SAID,
HE WAS BEGINNING TO HAVE NO LONGER THE SAME WISH.

THE UNPERSUADABLE POINT, WHICH HE DID NOT MENTION, EMMA GUESSED TO BE
GOOD BEHAVIOUR TO HIS FATHER.

"I HAVE MADE A MOST WRETCHED DISCOVERY," SAID HE, AFTER A SHORT PAUSE.--
"I HAVE BEEN HERE A WEEK TO-MORROW--HALF MY TIME. I NEVER KNEW DAYS FLY
SO FAST. A WEEK TO-MORROW!--AND I HAVE HARDLY BEGUN TO ENJOY MYSELF.
BUT JUST GOT ACQUAINTED WITH MRS. WESTON, AND OTHERS!--I HATE THE
RECOLLECTION."

"PERHAPS YOU MAY NOW BEGIN TO REGRET THAT YOU SPENT ONE WHOLE DAY, OUT
OF SO FEW, IN HAVING YOUR HAIR CUT."

"NO," SAID HE, SMILING, "THAT IS NO SUBJECT OF REGRET AT ALL. I HAVE
NO PLEASURE IN SEEING MY FRIENDS, UNLESS I CAN BELIEVE MYSELF FIT TO BE
SEEN."

THE REST OF THE GENTLEMEN BEING NOW IN THE ROOM, EMMA FOUND HERSELF
OBLIGED TO TURN FROM HIM FOR A FEW MINUTES, AND LISTEN TO MR. COLE. WHEN
MR. COLE HAD MOVED AWAY, AND HER ATTENTION COULD BE RESTORED AS BEFORE,
SHE SAW FRANK CHURCHILL LOOKING INTENTLY ACROSS THE ROOM AT MISS
FAIRFAX, WHO WAS SITTING EXACTLY OPPOSITE.

"WHAT IS THE MATTER?" SAID SHE.

HE STARTED. "THANK YOU FOR ROUSING ME," HE REPLIED. "I BELIEVE I HAVE
BEEN VERY RUDE; BUT REALLY MISS FAIRFAX HAS DONE HER HAIR IN SO ODD A
WAY--SO VERY ODD A WAY--THAT I CANNOT KEEP MY EYES FROM HER. I NEVER SAW
ANY THING SO OUTREE!--THOSE CURLS!--THIS MUST BE A FANCY OF HER OWN. I
SEE NOBODY ELSE LOOKING LIKE HER!--I MUST GO AND ASK HER WHETHER IT
IS AN IRISH FASHION. SHALL I?--YES, I WILL--I DECLARE I WILL--AND YOU
SHALL SEE HOW SHE TAKES IT;--WHETHER SHE COLOURS."

HE WAS GONE IMMEDIATELY; AND EMMA SOON SAW HIM STANDING BEFORE MISS
FAIRFAX, AND TALKING TO HER; BUT AS TO ITS EFFECT ON THE YOUNG LADY,
AS HE HAD IMPROVIDENTLY PLACED HIMSELF EXACTLY BETWEEN THEM, EXACTLY IN
FRONT OF MISS FAIRFAX, SHE COULD ABSOLUTELY DISTINGUISH NOTHING.

BEFORE HE COULD RETURN TO HIS CHAIR, IT WAS TAKEN BY MRS. WESTON.

"THIS IS THE LUXURY OF A LARGE PARTY," SAID SHE:--"ONE CAN GET NEAR
EVERY BODY, AND SAY EVERY THING. MY DEAR EMMA, I AM LONGING TO TALK
TO YOU. I HAVE BEEN MAKING DISCOVERIES AND FORMING PLANS, JUST LIKE
YOURSELF, AND I MUST TELL THEM WHILE THE IDEA IS FRESH. DO YOU KNOW HOW
MISS BATES AND HER NIECE CAME HERE?"

"HOW?--THEY WERE INVITED, WERE NOT THEY?"

"OH! YES--BUT HOW THEY WERE CONVEYED HITHER?--THE MANNER OF THEIR
COMING?"

"THEY WALKED, I CONCLUDE. HOW ELSE COULD THEY COME?"

"VERY TRUE.--WELL, A LITTLE WHILE AGO IT OCCURRED TO ME HOW VERY SAD
IT WOULD BE TO HAVE JANE FAIRFAX WALKING HOME AGAIN, LATE AT NIGHT, AND
COLD AS THE NIGHTS ARE NOW. AND AS I LOOKED AT HER, THOUGH I NEVER SAW
HER APPEAR TO MORE ADVANTAGE, IT STRUCK ME THAT SHE WAS HEATED, AND
WOULD THEREFORE BE PARTICULARLY LIABLE TO TAKE COLD. POOR GIRL! I COULD
NOT BEAR THE IDEA OF IT; SO, AS SOON AS MR. WESTON CAME INTO THE ROOM,
AND I COULD GET AT HIM, I SPOKE TO HIM ABOUT THE CARRIAGE. YOU MAY GUESS
HOW READILY HE CAME INTO MY WISHES; AND HAVING HIS APPROBATION, I MADE
MY WAY DIRECTLY TO MISS BATES, TO ASSURE HER THAT THE CARRIAGE WOULD BE
AT HER SERVICE BEFORE IT TOOK US HOME; FOR I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE MAKING
HER COMFORTABLE AT ONCE. GOOD SOUL! SHE WAS AS GRATEFUL AS POSSIBLE, YOU
MAY BE SURE. 'NOBODY WAS EVER SO FORTUNATE AS HERSELF!'--BUT WITH MANY,
MANY THANKS--'THERE WAS NO OCCASION TO TROUBLE US, FOR MR. KNIGHTLEY'S
CARRIAGE HAD BROUGHT, AND WAS TO TAKE THEM HOME AGAIN.' I WAS QUITE
SURPRIZED;--VERY GLAD, I AM SURE; BUT REALLY QUITE SURPRIZED. SUCH A
VERY KIND ATTENTION--AND SO THOUGHTFUL AN ATTENTION!--THE SORT OF THING
THAT SO FEW MEN WOULD THINK OF. AND, IN SHORT, FROM KNOWING HIS
USUAL WAYS, I AM VERY MUCH INCLINED TO THINK THAT IT WAS FOR THEIR
ACCOMMODATION THE CARRIAGE WAS USED AT ALL. I DO SUSPECT HE WOULD NOT
HAVE HAD A PAIR OF HORSES FOR HIMSELF, AND THAT IT WAS ONLY AS AN EXCUSE
FOR ASSISTING THEM."

"VERY LIKELY," SAID EMMA--"NOTHING MORE LIKELY. I KNOW NO MAN MORE
LIKELY THAN MR. KNIGHTLEY TO DO THE SORT OF THING--TO DO ANY THING
REALLY GOOD-NATURED, USEFUL, CONSIDERATE, OR BENEVOLENT. HE IS NOT A
GALLANT MAN, BUT HE IS A VERY HUMANE ONE; AND THIS, CONSIDERING JANE
FAIRFAX'S ILL-HEALTH, WOULD APPEAR A CASE OF HUMANITY TO HIM;--AND FOR
AN ACT OF UNOSTENTATIOUS KINDNESS, THERE IS NOBODY WHOM I WOULD FIX ON
MORE THAN ON MR. KNIGHTLEY. I KNOW HE HAD HORSES TO-DAY--FOR WE ARRIVED
TOGETHER; AND I LAUGHED AT HIM ABOUT IT, BUT HE SAID NOT A WORD THAT
COULD BETRAY."

"WELL," SAID MRS. WESTON, SMILING, "YOU GIVE HIM CREDIT FOR MORE SIMPLE,
DISINTERESTED BENEVOLENCE IN THIS INSTANCE THAN I DO; FOR WHILE MISS
BATES WAS SPEAKING, A SUSPICION DARTED INTO MY HEAD, AND I HAVE NEVER
BEEN ABLE TO GET IT OUT AGAIN. THE MORE I THINK OF IT, THE MORE PROBABLE
IT APPEARS. IN SHORT, I HAVE MADE A MATCH BETWEEN MR. KNIGHTLEY AND JANE
FAIRFAX. SEE THE CONSEQUENCE OF KEEPING YOU COMPANY!--WHAT DO YOU SAY TO
IT?"

"MR. KNIGHTLEY AND JANE FAIRFAX!" EXCLAIMED EMMA. "DEAR MRS. WESTON, HOW
COULD YOU THINK OF SUCH A THING?--MR. KNIGHTLEY!--MR. KNIGHTLEY MUST NOT
MARRY!--YOU WOULD NOT HAVE LITTLE HENRY CUT OUT FROM DONWELL?--OH! NO,
NO, HENRY MUST HAVE DONWELL. I CANNOT AT ALL CONSENT TO MR. KNIGHTLEY'S
MARRYING; AND I AM SURE IT IS NOT AT ALL LIKELY. I AM AMAZED THAT YOU
SHOULD THINK OF SUCH A THING."

"MY DEAR EMMA, I HAVE TOLD YOU WHAT LED ME TO THINK OF IT. I DO NOT WANT
THE MATCH--I DO NOT WANT TO INJURE DEAR LITTLE HENRY--BUT THE IDEA HAS
BEEN GIVEN ME BY CIRCUMSTANCES; AND IF MR. KNIGHTLEY REALLY WISHED TO
MARRY, YOU WOULD NOT HAVE HIM REFRAIN ON HENRY'S ACCOUNT, A BOY OF SIX
YEARS OLD, WHO KNOWS NOTHING OF THE MATTER?"

"YES, I WOULD. I COULD NOT BEAR TO HAVE HENRY SUPPLANTED.--MR.
KNIGHTLEY MARRY!--NO, I HAVE NEVER HAD SUCH AN IDEA, AND I CANNOT ADOPT
IT NOW. AND JANE FAIRFAX, TOO, OF ALL WOMEN!"

"NAY, SHE HAS ALWAYS BEEN A FIRST FAVOURITE WITH HIM, AS YOU VERY WELL
KNOW."

"BUT THE IMPRUDENCE OF SUCH A MATCH!"

"I AM NOT SPEAKING OF ITS PRUDENCE; MERELY ITS PROBABILITY."

"I SEE NO PROBABILITY IN IT, UNLESS YOU HAVE ANY BETTER FOUNDATION THAN
WHAT YOU MENTION. HIS GOOD-NATURE, HIS HUMANITY, AS I TELL YOU, WOULD
BE QUITE ENOUGH TO ACCOUNT FOR THE HORSES. HE HAS A GREAT REGARD FOR THE
BATESES, YOU KNOW, INDEPENDENT OF JANE FAIRFAX--AND IS ALWAYS GLAD TO
SHEW THEM ATTENTION. MY DEAR MRS. WESTON, DO NOT TAKE TO MATCH-MAKING.
YOU DO IT VERY ILL. JANE FAIRFAX MISTRESS OF THE ABBEY!--OH! NO,
NO;--EVERY FEELING REVOLTS. FOR HIS OWN SAKE, I WOULD NOT HAVE HIM DO SO
MAD A THING."

"IMPRUDENT, IF YOU PLEASE--BUT NOT MAD. EXCEPTING INEQUALITY OF FORTUNE,
AND PERHAPS A LITTLE DISPARITY OF AGE, I CAN SEE NOTHING UNSUITABLE."

"BUT MR. KNIGHTLEY DOES NOT WANT TO MARRY. I AM SURE HE HAS NOT THE
LEAST IDEA OF IT. DO NOT PUT IT INTO HIS HEAD. WHY SHOULD HE MARRY?--HE
IS AS HAPPY AS POSSIBLE BY HIMSELF; WITH HIS FARM, AND HIS SHEEP, AND
HIS LIBRARY, AND ALL THE PARISH TO MANAGE; AND HE IS EXTREMELY FOND OF
HIS BROTHER'S CHILDREN. HE HAS NO OCCASION TO MARRY, EITHER TO FILL UP
HIS TIME OR HIS HEART."

"MY DEAR EMMA, AS LONG AS HE THINKS SO, IT IS SO; BUT IF HE REALLY LOVES
JANE FAIRFAX--"

"NONSENSE! HE DOES NOT CARE ABOUT JANE FAIRFAX. IN THE WAY OF LOVE, I AM
SURE HE DOES NOT. HE WOULD DO ANY GOOD TO HER, OR HER FAMILY; BUT--"

"WELL," SAID MRS. WESTON, LAUGHING, "PERHAPS THE GREATEST GOOD HE COULD
DO THEM, WOULD BE TO GIVE JANE SUCH A RESPECTABLE HOME."

"IF IT WOULD BE GOOD TO HER, I AM SURE IT WOULD BE EVIL TO HIMSELF; A
VERY SHAMEFUL AND DEGRADING CONNEXION. HOW WOULD HE BEAR TO HAVE MISS
BATES BELONGING TO HIM?--TO HAVE HER HAUNTING THE ABBEY, AND THANKING
HIM ALL DAY LONG FOR HIS GREAT KINDNESS IN MARRYING JANE?--'SO VERY
KIND AND OBLIGING!--BUT HE ALWAYS HAD BEEN SUCH A VERY KIND NEIGHBOUR!'
AND THEN FLY OFF, THROUGH HALF A SENTENCE, TO HER MOTHER'S OLD
PETTICOAT. 'NOT THAT IT WAS SUCH A VERY OLD PETTICOAT EITHER--FOR STILL
IT WOULD LAST A GREAT WHILE--AND, INDEED, SHE MUST THANKFULLY SAY THAT
THEIR PETTICOATS WERE ALL VERY STRONG.'"

"FOR SHAME, EMMA! DO NOT MIMIC HER. YOU DIVERT ME AGAINST MY CONSCIENCE.
AND, UPON MY WORD, I DO NOT THINK MR. KNIGHTLEY WOULD BE MUCH DISTURBED
BY MISS BATES. LITTLE THINGS DO NOT IRRITATE HIM. SHE MIGHT TALK ON; AND
IF HE WANTED TO SAY ANY THING HIMSELF, HE WOULD ONLY TALK LOUDER, AND
DROWN HER VOICE. BUT THE QUESTION IS NOT, WHETHER IT WOULD BE A BAD
CONNEXION FOR HIM, BUT WHETHER HE WISHES IT; AND I THINK HE DOES. I HAVE
HEARD HIM SPEAK, AND SO MUST YOU, SO VERY HIGHLY OF JANE FAIRFAX! THE
INTEREST HE TAKES IN HER--HIS ANXIETY ABOUT HER HEALTH--HIS CONCERN THAT
SHE SHOULD HAVE NO HAPPIER PROSPECT! I HAVE HEARD HIM EXPRESS HIMSELF
SO WARMLY ON THOSE POINTS!--SUCH AN ADMIRER OF HER PERFORMANCE ON THE
PIANOFORTE, AND OF HER VOICE! I HAVE HEARD HIM SAY THAT HE COULD LISTEN
TO HER FOR EVER. OH! AND I HAD ALMOST FORGOTTEN ONE IDEA THAT OCCURRED
TO ME--THIS PIANOFORTE THAT HAS BEEN SENT HERE BY SOMEBODY--THOUGH
WE HAVE ALL BEEN SO WELL SATISFIED TO CONSIDER IT A PRESENT FROM THE
CAMPBELLS, MAY IT NOT BE FROM MR. KNIGHTLEY? I CANNOT HELP SUSPECTING
HIM. I THINK HE IS JUST THE PERSON TO DO IT, EVEN WITHOUT BEING IN
LOVE."

"THEN IT CAN BE NO ARGUMENT TO PROVE THAT HE IS IN LOVE. BUT I DO NOT
THINK IT IS AT ALL A LIKELY THING FOR HIM TO DO. MR. KNIGHTLEY DOES
NOTHING MYSTERIOUSLY."

"I HAVE HEARD HIM LAMENTING HER HAVING NO INSTRUMENT REPEATEDLY; OFTENER
THAN I SHOULD SUPPOSE SUCH A CIRCUMSTANCE WOULD, IN THE COMMON COURSE OF
THINGS, OCCUR TO HIM."

"VERY WELL; AND IF HE HAD INTENDED TO GIVE HER ONE, HE WOULD HAVE TOLD
HER SO."

"THERE MIGHT BE SCRUPLES OF DELICACY, MY DEAR EMMA. I HAVE A VERY STRONG
NOTION THAT IT COMES FROM HIM. I AM SURE HE WAS PARTICULARLY SILENT WHEN
MRS. COLE TOLD US OF IT AT DINNER."

"YOU TAKE UP AN IDEA, MRS. WESTON, AND RUN AWAY WITH IT; AS YOU HAVE
MANY A TIME REPROACHED ME WITH DOING. I SEE NO SIGN OF ATTACHMENT--I
BELIEVE NOTHING OF THE PIANOFORTE--AND PROOF ONLY SHALL CONVINCE ME THAT
MR. KNIGHTLEY HAS ANY THOUGHT OF MARRYING JANE FAIRFAX."

THEY COMBATED THE POINT SOME TIME LONGER IN THE SAME WAY; EMMA RATHER
GAINING GROUND OVER THE MIND OF HER FRIEND; FOR MRS. WESTON WAS THE MOST
USED OF THE TWO TO YIELD; TILL A LITTLE BUSTLE IN THE ROOM SHEWED THEM
THAT TEA WAS OVER, AND THE INSTRUMENT IN PREPARATION;--AND AT THE SAME
MOMENT MR. COLE APPROACHING TO ENTREAT MISS WOODHOUSE WOULD DO THEM THE
HONOUR OF TRYING IT. FRANK CHURCHILL, OF WHOM, IN THE EAGERNESS OF HER
CONVERSATION WITH MRS. WESTON, SHE HAD BEEN SEEING NOTHING, EXCEPT THAT
HE HAD FOUND A SEAT BY MISS FAIRFAX, FOLLOWED MR. COLE, TO ADD HIS VERY
PRESSING ENTREATIES; AND AS, IN EVERY RESPECT, IT SUITED EMMA BEST TO
LEAD, SHE GAVE A VERY PROPER COMPLIANCE.

SHE KNEW THE LIMITATIONS OF HER OWN POWERS TOO WELL TO ATTEMPT MORE THAN
SHE COULD PERFORM WITH CREDIT; SHE WANTED NEITHER TASTE NOR SPIRIT IN
THE LITTLE THINGS WHICH ARE GENERALLY ACCEPTABLE, AND COULD ACCOMPANY
HER OWN VOICE WELL. ONE ACCOMPANIMENT TO HER SONG TOOK HER AGREEABLY BY
SURPRIZE--A SECOND, SLIGHTLY BUT CORRECTLY TAKEN BY FRANK CHURCHILL. HER
PARDON WAS DULY BEGGED AT THE CLOSE OF THE SONG, AND EVERY THING USUAL
FOLLOWED. HE WAS ACCUSED OF HAVING A DELIGHTFUL VOICE, AND A PERFECT
KNOWLEDGE OF MUSIC; WHICH WAS PROPERLY DENIED; AND THAT HE KNEW NOTHING
OF THE MATTER, AND HAD NO VOICE AT ALL, ROUNDLY ASSERTED. THEY SANG
TOGETHER ONCE MORE; AND EMMA WOULD THEN RESIGN HER PLACE TO MISS
FAIRFAX, WHOSE PERFORMANCE, BOTH VOCAL AND INSTRUMENTAL, SHE NEVER COULD
ATTEMPT TO CONCEAL FROM HERSELF, WAS INFINITELY SUPERIOR TO HER OWN.

WITH MIXED FEELINGS, SHE SEATED HERSELF AT A LITTLE DISTANCE FROM THE
NUMBERS ROUND THE INSTRUMENT, TO LISTEN. FRANK CHURCHILL SANG AGAIN.
THEY HAD SUNG TOGETHER ONCE OR TWICE, IT APPEARED, AT WEYMOUTH. BUT THE
SIGHT OF MR. KNIGHTLEY AMONG THE MOST ATTENTIVE, SOON DREW AWAY HALF
EMMA'S MIND; AND SHE FELL INTO A TRAIN OF THINKING ON THE SUBJECT OF
MRS. WESTON'S SUSPICIONS, TO WHICH THE SWEET SOUNDS OF THE UNITED VOICES
GAVE ONLY MOMENTARY INTERRUPTIONS. HER OBJECTIONS TO MR. KNIGHTLEY'S
MARRYING DID NOT IN THE LEAST SUBSIDE. SHE COULD SEE NOTHING BUT EVIL
IN IT. IT WOULD BE A GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT TO MR. JOHN KNIGHTLEY;
CONSEQUENTLY TO ISABELLA. A REAL INJURY TO THE CHILDREN--A MOST
MORTIFYING CHANGE, AND MATERIAL LOSS TO THEM ALL;--A VERY GREAT
DEDUCTION FROM HER FATHER'S DAILY COMFORT--AND, AS TO HERSELF, SHE COULD
NOT AT ALL ENDURE THE IDEA OF JANE FAIRFAX AT DONWELL ABBEY. A MRS.
KNIGHTLEY FOR THEM ALL TO GIVE WAY TO!--NO--MR. KNIGHTLEY MUST NEVER
MARRY. LITTLE HENRY MUST REMAIN THE HEIR OF DONWELL.

PRESENTLY MR. KNIGHTLEY LOOKED BACK, AND CAME AND SAT DOWN BY HER. THEY
TALKED AT FIRST ONLY OF THE PERFORMANCE. HIS ADMIRATION WAS CERTAINLY
VERY WARM; YET SHE THOUGHT, BUT FOR MRS. WESTON, IT WOULD NOT HAVE
STRUCK HER. AS A SORT OF TOUCHSTONE, HOWEVER, SHE BEGAN TO SPEAK OF HIS
KINDNESS IN CONVEYING THE AUNT AND NIECE; AND THOUGH HIS ANSWER WAS IN
THE SPIRIT OF CUTTING THE MATTER SHORT, SHE BELIEVED IT TO INDICATE ONLY
HIS DISINCLINATION TO DWELL ON ANY KINDNESS OF HIS OWN.

"I OFTEN FEEL CONCERN," SAID SHE, "THAT I DARE NOT MAKE OUR CARRIAGE
MORE USEFUL ON SUCH OCCASIONS. IT IS NOT THAT I AM WITHOUT THE WISH; BUT
YOU KNOW HOW IMPOSSIBLE MY FATHER WOULD DEEM IT THAT JAMES SHOULD PUT-TO
FOR SUCH A PURPOSE."

"QUITE OUT OF THE QUESTION, QUITE OUT OF THE QUESTION," HE
REPLIED;--"BUT YOU MUST OFTEN WISH IT, I AM SURE." AND HE SMILED WITH
SUCH SEEMING PLEASURE AT THE CONVICTION, THAT SHE MUST PROCEED ANOTHER
STEP.

"THIS PRESENT FROM THE CAMPBELLS," SAID SHE--"THIS PIANOFORTE IS VERY
KINDLY GIVEN."

"YES," HE REPLIED, AND WITHOUT THE SMALLEST APPARENT
EMBARRASSMENT.--"BUT THEY WOULD HAVE DONE BETTER HAD THEY GIVEN
HER NOTICE OF IT. SURPRIZES ARE FOOLISH THINGS. THE PLEASURE IS NOT
ENHANCED, AND THE INCONVENIENCE IS OFTEN CONSIDERABLE. I SHOULD HAVE
EXPECTED BETTER JUDGMENT IN COLONEL CAMPBELL."

FROM THAT MOMENT, EMMA COULD HAVE TAKEN HER OATH THAT MR. KNIGHTLEY HAD
HAD NO CONCERN IN GIVING THE INSTRUMENT. BUT WHETHER HE WERE
ENTIRELY FREE FROM PECULIAR ATTACHMENT--WHETHER THERE WERE NO ACTUAL
PREFERENCE--REMAINED A LITTLE LONGER DOUBTFUL. TOWARDS THE END OF JANE'S
SECOND SONG, HER VOICE GREW THICK.

"THAT WILL DO," SAID HE, WHEN IT WAS FINISHED, THINKING ALOUD--"YOU HAVE
SUNG QUITE ENOUGH FOR ONE EVENING--NOW BE QUIET."

ANOTHER SONG, HOWEVER, WAS SOON BEGGED FOR. "ONE MORE;--THEY WOULD NOT
FATIGUE MISS FAIRFAX ON ANY ACCOUNT, AND WOULD ONLY ASK FOR ONE MORE."
AND FRANK CHURCHILL WAS HEARD TO SAY, "I THINK YOU COULD MANAGE THIS
WITHOUT EFFORT; THE FIRST PART IS SO VERY TRIFLING. THE STRENGTH OF THE
SONG FALLS ON THE SECOND."

MR. KNIGHTLEY GREW ANGRY.

"THAT FELLOW," SAID HE, INDIGNANTLY, "THINKS OF NOTHING BUT SHEWING OFF
HIS OWN VOICE. THIS MUST NOT BE." AND TOUCHING MISS BATES, WHO AT THAT
MOMENT PASSED NEAR--"MISS BATES, ARE YOU MAD, TO LET YOUR NIECE SING
HERSELF HOARSE IN THIS MANNER? GO, AND INTERFERE. THEY HAVE NO MERCY ON
HER."

MISS BATES, IN HER REAL ANXIETY FOR JANE, COULD HARDLY STAY EVEN TO
BE GRATEFUL, BEFORE SHE STEPT FORWARD AND PUT AN END TO ALL FARTHER
SINGING. HERE CEASED THE CONCERT PART OF THE EVENING, FOR MISS WOODHOUSE
AND MISS FAIRFAX WERE THE ONLY YOUNG LADY PERFORMERS; BUT SOON (WITHIN
FIVE MINUTES) THE PROPOSAL OF DANCING--ORIGINATING NOBODY EXACTLY KNEW
WHERE--WAS SO EFFECTUALLY PROMOTED BY MR. AND MRS. COLE, THAT EVERY
THING WAS RAPIDLY CLEARING AWAY, TO GIVE PROPER SPACE. MRS. WESTON,
CAPITAL IN HER COUNTRY-DANCES, WAS SEATED, AND BEGINNING AN IRRESISTIBLE
WALTZ; AND FRANK CHURCHILL, COMING UP WITH MOST BECOMING GALLANTRY TO
EMMA, HAD SECURED HER HAND, AND LED HER UP TO THE TOP.

WHILE WAITING TILL THE OTHER YOUNG PEOPLE COULD PAIR THEMSELVES OFF,
EMMA FOUND TIME, IN SPITE OF THE COMPLIMENTS SHE WAS RECEIVING ON
HER VOICE AND HER TASTE, TO LOOK ABOUT, AND SEE WHAT BECAME OF MR.
KNIGHTLEY. THIS WOULD BE A TRIAL. HE WAS NO DANCER IN GENERAL. IF HE
WERE TO BE VERY ALERT IN ENGAGING JANE FAIRFAX NOW, IT MIGHT AUGUR
SOMETHING. THERE WAS NO IMMEDIATE APPEARANCE. NO; HE WAS TALKING TO MRS.
COLE--HE WAS LOOKING ON UNCONCERNED; JANE WAS ASKED BY SOMEBODY ELSE,
AND HE WAS STILL TALKING TO MRS. COLE.

EMMA HAD NO LONGER AN ALARM FOR HENRY; HIS INTEREST WAS YET SAFE; AND
SHE LED OFF THE DANCE WITH GENUINE SPIRIT AND ENJOYMENT. NOT MORE THAN
FIVE COUPLE COULD BE MUSTERED; BUT THE RARITY AND THE SUDDENNESS OF
IT MADE IT VERY DELIGHTFUL, AND SHE FOUND HERSELF WELL MATCHED IN A
PARTNER. THEY WERE A COUPLE WORTH LOOKING AT.

TWO DANCES, UNFORTUNATELY, WERE ALL THAT COULD BE ALLOWED. IT WAS
GROWING LATE, AND MISS BATES BECAME ANXIOUS TO GET HOME, ON HER MOTHER'S
ACCOUNT. AFTER SOME ATTEMPTS, THEREFORE, TO BE PERMITTED TO BEGIN AGAIN,
THEY WERE OBLIGED TO THANK MRS. WESTON, LOOK SORROWFUL, AND HAVE DONE.

"PERHAPS IT IS AS WELL," SAID FRANK CHURCHILL, AS HE ATTENDED EMMA TO
HER CARRIAGE. "I MUST HAVE ASKED MISS FAIRFAX, AND HER LANGUID DANCING
WOULD NOT HAVE AGREED WITH ME, AFTER YOURS."



CHAPTER IX


EMMA DID NOT REPENT HER CONDESCENSION IN GOING TO THE COLES. THE VISIT
AFFORDED HER MANY PLEASANT RECOLLECTIONS THE NEXT DAY; AND ALL THAT SHE
MIGHT BE SUPPOSED TO HAVE LOST ON THE SIDE OF DIGNIFIED SECLUSION, MUST
BE AMPLY REPAID IN THE SPLENDOUR OF POPULARITY. SHE MUST HAVE DELIGHTED
THE COLES--WORTHY PEOPLE, WHO DESERVED TO BE MADE HAPPY!--AND LEFT A
NAME BEHIND HER THAT WOULD NOT SOON DIE AWAY.

PERFECT HAPPINESS, EVEN IN MEMORY, IS NOT COMMON; AND THERE WERE TWO
POINTS ON WHICH SHE WAS NOT QUITE EASY. SHE DOUBTED WHETHER SHE HAD NOT
TRANSGRESSED THE DUTY OF WOMAN BY WOMAN, IN BETRAYING HER SUSPICIONS OF
JANE FAIRFAX'S FEELINGS TO FRANK CHURCHILL. IT WAS HARDLY RIGHT; BUT IT
HAD BEEN SO STRONG AN IDEA, THAT IT WOULD ESCAPE HER, AND HIS SUBMISSION
TO ALL THAT SHE TOLD, WAS A COMPLIMENT TO HER PENETRATION, WHICH MADE
IT DIFFICULT FOR HER TO BE QUITE CERTAIN THAT SHE OUGHT TO HAVE HELD HER
TONGUE.

THE OTHER CIRCUMSTANCE OF REGRET RELATED ALSO TO JANE FAIRFAX; AND
THERE SHE HAD NO DOUBT. SHE DID UNFEIGNEDLY AND UNEQUIVOCALLY REGRET THE
INFERIORITY OF HER OWN PLAYING AND SINGING. SHE DID MOST HEARTILY
GRIEVE OVER THE IDLENESS OF HER CHILDHOOD--AND SAT DOWN AND PRACTISED
VIGOROUSLY AN HOUR AND A HALF.

SHE WAS THEN INTERRUPTED BY HARRIET'S COMING IN; AND IF HARRIET'S PRAISE
COULD HAVE SATISFIED HER, SHE MIGHT SOON HAVE BEEN COMFORTED.

"OH! IF I COULD BUT PLAY AS WELL AS YOU AND MISS FAIRFAX!"

"DON'T CLASS US TOGETHER, HARRIET. MY PLAYING IS NO MORE LIKE HER'S,
THAN A LAMP IS LIKE SUNSHINE."

"OH! DEAR--I THINK YOU PLAY THE BEST OF THE TWO. I THINK YOU PLAY QUITE
AS WELL AS SHE DOES. I AM SURE I HAD MUCH RATHER HEAR YOU. EVERY BODY
LAST NIGHT SAID HOW WELL YOU PLAYED."

"THOSE WHO KNEW ANY THING ABOUT IT, MUST HAVE FELT THE DIFFERENCE. THE
TRUTH IS, HARRIET, THAT MY PLAYING IS JUST GOOD ENOUGH TO BE PRAISED,
BUT JANE FAIRFAX'S IS MUCH BEYOND IT."

"WELL, I ALWAYS SHALL THINK THAT YOU PLAY QUITE AS WELL AS SHE DOES, OR
THAT IF THERE IS ANY DIFFERENCE NOBODY WOULD EVER FIND IT OUT. MR. COLE
SAID HOW MUCH TASTE YOU HAD; AND MR. FRANK CHURCHILL TALKED A GREAT DEAL
ABOUT YOUR TASTE, AND THAT HE VALUED TASTE MUCH MORE THAN EXECUTION."

"AH! BUT JANE FAIRFAX HAS THEM BOTH, HARRIET."

"ARE YOU SURE? I SAW SHE HAD EXECUTION, BUT I DID NOT KNOW SHE HAD ANY
TASTE. NOBODY TALKED ABOUT IT. AND I HATE ITALIAN SINGING.--THERE IS NO
UNDERSTANDING A WORD OF IT. BESIDES, IF SHE DOES PLAY SO VERY WELL, YOU
KNOW, IT IS NO MORE THAN SHE IS OBLIGED TO DO, BECAUSE SHE WILL HAVE TO
TEACH. THE COXES WERE WONDERING LAST NIGHT WHETHER SHE WOULD GET INTO
ANY GREAT FAMILY. HOW DID YOU THINK THE COXES LOOKED?"

"JUST AS THEY ALWAYS DO--VERY VULGAR."

"THEY TOLD ME SOMETHING," SAID HARRIET RATHER HESITATINGLY; "BUT IT IS
NOTHING OF ANY CONSEQUENCE."

EMMA WAS OBLIGED TO ASK WHAT THEY HAD TOLD HER, THOUGH FEARFUL OF ITS
PRODUCING MR. ELTON.

"THEY TOLD ME--THAT MR. MARTIN DINED WITH THEM LAST SATURDAY."

"OH!"

"HE CAME TO THEIR FATHER UPON SOME BUSINESS, AND HE ASKED HIM TO STAY TO
DINNER."

"OH!"

"THEY TALKED A GREAT DEAL ABOUT HIM, ESPECIALLY ANNE COX. I DO NOT KNOW
WHAT SHE MEANT, BUT SHE ASKED ME IF I THOUGHT I SHOULD GO AND STAY THERE
AGAIN NEXT SUMMER."

"SHE MEANT TO BE IMPERTINENTLY CURIOUS, JUST AS SUCH AN ANNE COX SHOULD
BE."

"SHE SAID HE WAS VERY AGREEABLE THE DAY HE DINED THERE. HE SAT BY HER AT
DINNER. MISS NASH THINKS EITHER OF THE COXES WOULD BE VERY GLAD TO MARRY
HIM."

"VERY LIKELY.--I THINK THEY ARE, WITHOUT EXCEPTION, THE MOST VULGAR
GIRLS IN HIGHBURY."

HARRIET HAD BUSINESS AT FORD'S.--EMMA THOUGHT IT MOST PRUDENT TO GO WITH
HER. ANOTHER ACCIDENTAL MEETING WITH THE MARTINS WAS POSSIBLE, AND IN
HER PRESENT STATE, WOULD BE DANGEROUS.

HARRIET, TEMPTED BY EVERY THING AND SWAYED BY HALF A WORD, WAS ALWAYS
VERY LONG AT A PURCHASE; AND WHILE SHE WAS STILL HANGING OVER MUSLINS
AND CHANGING HER MIND, EMMA WENT TO THE DOOR FOR AMUSEMENT.--MUCH COULD
NOT BE HOPED FROM THE TRAFFIC OF EVEN THE BUSIEST PART OF HIGHBURY;--MR.
PERRY WALKING HASTILY BY, MR. WILLIAM COX LETTING HIMSELF IN AT THE
OFFICE-DOOR, MR. COLE'S CARRIAGE-HORSES RETURNING FROM EXERCISE, OR A
STRAY LETTER-BOY ON AN OBSTINATE MULE, WERE THE LIVELIEST OBJECTS SHE
COULD PRESUME TO EXPECT; AND WHEN HER EYES FELL ONLY ON THE BUTCHER WITH
HIS TRAY, A TIDY OLD WOMAN TRAVELLING HOMEWARDS FROM SHOP WITH HER FULL
BASKET, TWO CURS QUARRELLING OVER A DIRTY BONE, AND A STRING OF DAWDLING
CHILDREN ROUND THE BAKER'S LITTLE BOW-WINDOW EYEING THE GINGERBREAD, SHE
KNEW SHE HAD NO REASON TO COMPLAIN, AND WAS AMUSED ENOUGH; QUITE ENOUGH
STILL TO STAND AT THE DOOR. A MIND LIVELY AND AT EASE, CAN DO WITH
SEEING NOTHING, AND CAN SEE NOTHING THAT DOES NOT ANSWER.

SHE LOOKED DOWN THE RANDALLS ROAD. THE SCENE ENLARGED; TWO PERSONS
APPEARED; MRS. WESTON AND HER SON-IN-LAW; THEY WERE WALKING INTO
HIGHBURY;--TO HARTFIELD OF COURSE. THEY WERE STOPPING, HOWEVER, IN THE
FIRST PLACE AT MRS. BATES'S; WHOSE HOUSE WAS A LITTLE NEARER
RANDALLS THAN FORD'S; AND HAD ALL BUT KNOCKED, WHEN EMMA CAUGHT THEIR
EYE.--IMMEDIATELY THEY CROSSED THE ROAD AND CAME FORWARD TO HER; AND THE
AGREEABLENESS OF YESTERDAY'S ENGAGEMENT SEEMED TO GIVE FRESH PLEASURE TO
THE PRESENT MEETING. MRS. WESTON INFORMED HER THAT SHE WAS GOING TO CALL
ON THE BATESES, IN ORDER TO HEAR THE NEW INSTRUMENT.

"FOR MY COMPANION TELLS ME," SAID SHE, "THAT I ABSOLUTELY PROMISED MISS
BATES LAST NIGHT, THAT I WOULD COME THIS MORNING. I WAS NOT AWARE OF IT
MYSELF. I DID NOT KNOW THAT I HAD FIXED A DAY, BUT AS HE SAYS I DID, I
AM GOING NOW."

"AND WHILE MRS. WESTON PAYS HER VISIT, I MAY BE ALLOWED, I HOPE," SAID
FRANK CHURCHILL, "TO JOIN YOUR PARTY AND WAIT FOR HER AT HARTFIELD--IF
YOU ARE GOING HOME."

MRS. WESTON WAS DISAPPOINTED.

"I THOUGHT YOU MEANT TO GO WITH ME. THEY WOULD BE VERY MUCH PLEASED."

"ME! I SHOULD BE QUITE IN THE WAY. BUT, PERHAPS--I MAY BE EQUALLY IN THE
WAY HERE. MISS WOODHOUSE LOOKS AS IF SHE DID NOT WANT ME. MY AUNT ALWAYS
SENDS ME OFF WHEN SHE IS SHOPPING. SHE SAYS I FIDGET HER TO DEATH; AND
MISS WOODHOUSE LOOKS AS IF SHE COULD ALMOST SAY THE SAME. WHAT AM I TO
DO?"

"I AM HERE ON NO BUSINESS OF MY OWN," SAID EMMA; "I AM ONLY WAITING FOR
MY FRIEND. SHE WILL PROBABLY HAVE SOON DONE, AND THEN WE SHALL GO HOME.
BUT YOU HAD BETTER GO WITH MRS. WESTON AND HEAR THE INSTRUMENT."

"WELL--IF YOU ADVISE IT.--BUT (WITH A SMILE) IF COLONEL CAMPBELL SHOULD
HAVE EMPLOYED A CARELESS FRIEND, AND IF IT SHOULD PROVE TO HAVE AN
INDIFFERENT TONE--WHAT SHALL I SAY? I SHALL BE NO SUPPORT TO MRS.
WESTON. SHE MIGHT DO VERY WELL BY HERSELF. A DISAGREEABLE TRUTH WOULD BE
PALATABLE THROUGH HER LIPS, BUT I AM THE WRETCHEDEST BEING IN THE WORLD
AT A CIVIL FALSEHOOD."

"I DO NOT BELIEVE ANY SUCH THING," REPLIED EMMA.--"I AM PERSUADED THAT
YOU CAN BE AS INSINCERE AS YOUR NEIGHBOURS, WHEN IT IS NECESSARY; BUT
THERE IS NO REASON TO SUPPOSE THE INSTRUMENT IS INDIFFERENT. QUITE
OTHERWISE INDEED, IF I UNDERSTOOD MISS FAIRFAX'S OPINION LAST NIGHT."

"DO COME WITH ME," SAID MRS. WESTON, "IF IT BE NOT VERY DISAGREEABLE TO
YOU. IT NEED NOT DETAIN US LONG. WE WILL GO TO HARTFIELD AFTERWARDS.
WE WILL FOLLOW THEM TO HARTFIELD. I REALLY WISH YOU TO CALL WITH ME. IT
WILL BE FELT SO GREAT AN ATTENTION! AND I ALWAYS THOUGHT YOU MEANT IT."

HE COULD SAY NO MORE; AND WITH THE HOPE OF HARTFIELD TO REWARD HIM,
RETURNED WITH MRS. WESTON TO MRS. BATES'S DOOR. EMMA WATCHED THEM IN,
AND THEN JOINED HARRIET AT THE INTERESTING COUNTER,--TRYING, WITH ALL
THE FORCE OF HER OWN MIND, TO CONVINCE HER THAT IF SHE WANTED PLAIN
MUSLIN IT WAS OF NO USE TO LOOK AT FIGURED; AND THAT A BLUE RIBBON, BE
IT EVER SO BEAUTIFUL, WOULD STILL NEVER MATCH HER YELLOW PATTERN. AT
LAST IT WAS ALL SETTLED, EVEN TO THE DESTINATION OF THE PARCEL.

"SHOULD I SEND IT TO MRS. GODDARD'S, MA'AM?" ASKED MRS.
FORD.--"YES--NO--YES, TO MRS. GODDARD'S. ONLY MY PATTERN GOWN IS AT
HARTFIELD. NO, YOU SHALL SEND IT TO HARTFIELD, IF YOU PLEASE. BUT THEN,
MRS. GODDARD WILL WANT TO SEE IT.--AND I COULD TAKE THE PATTERN GOWN
HOME ANY DAY. BUT I SHALL WANT THE RIBBON DIRECTLY--SO IT HAD BETTER GO
TO HARTFIELD--AT LEAST THE RIBBON. YOU COULD MAKE IT INTO TWO PARCELS,
MRS. FORD, COULD NOT YOU?"

"IT IS NOT WORTH WHILE, HARRIET, TO GIVE MRS. FORD THE TROUBLE OF TWO
PARCELS."

"NO MORE IT IS."

"NO TROUBLE IN THE WORLD, MA'AM," SAID THE OBLIGING MRS. FORD.

"OH! BUT INDEED I WOULD MUCH RATHER HAVE IT ONLY IN ONE. THEN, IF YOU
PLEASE, YOU SHALL SEND IT ALL TO MRS. GODDARD'S--I DO NOT KNOW--NO, I
THINK, MISS WOODHOUSE, I MAY JUST AS WELL HAVE IT SENT TO HARTFIELD, AND
TAKE IT HOME WITH ME AT NIGHT. WHAT DO YOU ADVISE?"

"THAT YOU DO NOT GIVE ANOTHER HALF-SECOND TO THE SUBJECT. TO HARTFIELD,
IF YOU PLEASE, MRS. FORD."

"AYE, THAT WILL BE MUCH BEST," SAID HARRIET, QUITE SATISFIED, "I SHOULD
NOT AT ALL LIKE TO HAVE IT SENT TO MRS. GODDARD'S."

VOICES APPROACHED THE SHOP--OR RATHER ONE VOICE AND TWO LADIES: MRS.
WESTON AND MISS BATES MET THEM AT THE DOOR.

"MY DEAR MISS WOODHOUSE," SAID THE LATTER, "I AM JUST RUN ACROSS TO
ENTREAT THE FAVOUR OF YOU TO COME AND SIT DOWN WITH US A LITTLE WHILE,
AND GIVE US YOUR OPINION OF OUR NEW INSTRUMENT; YOU AND MISS SMITH. HOW
DO YOU DO, MISS SMITH?--VERY WELL I THANK YOU.--AND I BEGGED MRS. WESTON
TO COME WITH ME, THAT I MIGHT BE SURE OF SUCCEEDING."

"I HOPE MRS. BATES AND MISS FAIRFAX ARE--"

"VERY WELL, I AM MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU. MY MOTHER IS DELIGHTFULLY WELL;
AND JANE CAUGHT NO COLD LAST NIGHT. HOW IS MR. WOODHOUSE?--I AM SO GLAD
TO HEAR SUCH A GOOD ACCOUNT. MRS. WESTON TOLD ME YOU WERE HERE.--OH!
THEN, SAID I, I MUST RUN ACROSS, I AM SURE MISS WOODHOUSE WILL ALLOW ME
JUST TO RUN ACROSS AND ENTREAT HER TO COME IN; MY MOTHER WILL BE SO
VERY HAPPY TO SEE HER--AND NOW WE ARE SUCH A NICE PARTY, SHE CANNOT
REFUSE.--'AYE, PRAY DO,' SAID MR. FRANK CHURCHILL, 'MISS WOODHOUSE'S
OPINION OF THE INSTRUMENT WILL BE WORTH HAVING.'--BUT, SAID I, I SHALL
BE MORE SURE OF SUCCEEDING IF ONE OF YOU WILL GO WITH ME.--'OH,' SAID
HE, 'WAIT HALF A MINUTE, TILL I HAVE FINISHED MY JOB;'--FOR, WOULD YOU
BELIEVE IT, MISS WOODHOUSE, THERE HE IS, IN THE MOST OBLIGING MANNER IN
THE WORLD, FASTENING IN THE RIVET OF MY MOTHER'S SPECTACLES.--THE RIVET
CAME OUT, YOU KNOW, THIS MORNING.--SO VERY OBLIGING!--FOR MY MOTHER HAD
NO USE OF HER SPECTACLES--COULD NOT PUT THEM ON. AND, BY THE BYE, EVERY
BODY OUGHT TO HAVE TWO PAIR OF SPECTACLES; THEY SHOULD INDEED. JANE SAID
SO. I MEANT TO TAKE THEM OVER TO JOHN SAUNDERS THE FIRST THING I DID,
BUT SOMETHING OR OTHER HINDERED ME ALL THE MORNING; FIRST ONE THING,
THEN ANOTHER, THERE IS NO SAYING WHAT, YOU KNOW. AT ONE TIME PATTY CAME
TO SAY SHE THOUGHT THE KITCHEN CHIMNEY WANTED SWEEPING. OH, SAID I,
PATTY DO NOT COME WITH YOUR BAD NEWS TO ME. HERE IS THE RIVET OF YOUR
MISTRESS'S SPECTACLES OUT. THEN THE BAKED APPLES CAME HOME, MRS. WALLIS
SENT THEM BY HER BOY; THEY ARE EXTREMELY CIVIL AND OBLIGING TO US, THE
WALLISES, ALWAYS--I HAVE HEARD SOME PEOPLE SAY THAT MRS. WALLIS CAN BE
UNCIVIL AND GIVE A VERY RUDE ANSWER, BUT WE HAVE NEVER KNOWN ANY THING
BUT THE GREATEST ATTENTION FROM THEM. AND IT CANNOT BE FOR THE VALUE
OF OUR CUSTOM NOW, FOR WHAT IS OUR CONSUMPTION OF BREAD, YOU KNOW?
ONLY THREE OF US.--BESIDES DEAR JANE AT PRESENT--AND SHE REALLY EATS
NOTHING--MAKES SUCH A SHOCKING BREAKFAST, YOU WOULD BE QUITE FRIGHTENED
IF YOU SAW IT. I DARE NOT LET MY MOTHER KNOW HOW LITTLE SHE EATS--SO I
SAY ONE THING AND THEN I SAY ANOTHER, AND IT PASSES OFF. BUT ABOUT THE
MIDDLE OF THE DAY SHE GETS HUNGRY, AND THERE IS NOTHING SHE LIKES SO
WELL AS THESE BAKED APPLES, AND THEY ARE EXTREMELY WHOLESOME, FOR I TOOK
THE OPPORTUNITY THE OTHER DAY OF ASKING MR. PERRY; I HAPPENED TO MEET
HIM IN THE STREET. NOT THAT I HAD ANY DOUBT BEFORE--I HAVE SO OFTEN
HEARD MR. WOODHOUSE RECOMMEND A BAKED APPLE. I BELIEVE IT IS THE ONLY
WAY THAT MR. WOODHOUSE THINKS THE FRUIT THOROUGHLY WHOLESOME. WE
HAVE APPLE-DUMPLINGS, HOWEVER, VERY OFTEN. PATTY MAKES AN EXCELLENT
APPLE-DUMPLING. WELL, MRS. WESTON, YOU HAVE PREVAILED, I HOPE, AND THESE
LADIES WILL OBLIGE US."

EMMA WOULD BE "VERY HAPPY TO WAIT ON MRS. BATES, ETC.," AND THEY DID AT
LAST MOVE OUT OF THE SHOP, WITH NO FARTHER DELAY FROM MISS BATES THAN,

"HOW DO YOU DO, MRS. FORD? I BEG YOUR PARDON. I DID NOT SEE YOU BEFORE.
I HEAR YOU HAVE A CHARMING COLLECTION OF NEW RIBBONS FROM TOWN. JANE
CAME BACK DELIGHTED YESTERDAY. THANK YE, THE GLOVES DO VERY WELL--ONLY A
LITTLE TOO LARGE ABOUT THE WRIST; BUT JANE IS TAKING THEM IN."

"WHAT WAS I TALKING OF?" SAID SHE, BEGINNING AGAIN WHEN THEY WERE ALL IN
THE STREET.

EMMA WONDERED ON WHAT, OF ALL THE MEDLEY, SHE WOULD FIX.

"I DECLARE I CANNOT RECOLLECT WHAT I WAS TALKING OF.--OH! MY MOTHER'S
SPECTACLES. SO VERY OBLIGING OF MR. FRANK CHURCHILL! 'OH!' SAID HE,
'I DO THINK I CAN FASTEN THE RIVET; I LIKE A JOB OF THIS KIND
EXCESSIVELY.'--WHICH YOU KNOW SHEWED HIM TO BE SO VERY.... INDEED I MUST
SAY THAT, MUCH AS I HAD HEARD OF HIM BEFORE AND MUCH AS I HAD EXPECTED,
HE VERY FAR EXCEEDS ANY THING.... I DO CONGRATULATE YOU, MRS. WESTON,
MOST WARMLY. HE SEEMS EVERY THING THE FONDEST PARENT COULD....
'OH!' SAID HE, 'I CAN FASTEN THE RIVET. I LIKE A JOB OF THAT SORT
EXCESSIVELY.' I NEVER SHALL FORGET HIS MANNER. AND WHEN I BROUGHT OUT
THE BAKED APPLES FROM THE CLOSET, AND HOPED OUR FRIENDS WOULD BE SO VERY
OBLIGING AS TO TAKE SOME, 'OH!' SAID HE DIRECTLY, 'THERE IS NOTHING
IN THE WAY OF FRUIT HALF SO GOOD, AND THESE ARE THE FINEST-LOOKING
HOME-BAKED APPLES I EVER SAW IN MY LIFE.' THAT, YOU KNOW, WAS SO
VERY.... AND I AM SURE, BY HIS MANNER, IT WAS NO COMPLIMENT. INDEED THEY
ARE VERY DELIGHTFUL APPLES, AND MRS. WALLIS DOES THEM FULL JUSTICE--ONLY
WE DO NOT HAVE THEM BAKED MORE THAN TWICE, AND MR. WOODHOUSE MADE US
PROMISE TO HAVE THEM DONE THREE TIMES--BUT MISS WOODHOUSE WILL BE SO
GOOD AS NOT TO MENTION IT. THE APPLES THEMSELVES ARE THE VERY FINEST
SORT FOR BAKING, BEYOND A DOUBT; ALL FROM DONWELL--SOME OF MR.
KNIGHTLEY'S MOST LIBERAL SUPPLY. HE SENDS US A SACK EVERY YEAR; AND
CERTAINLY THERE NEVER WAS SUCH A KEEPING APPLE ANYWHERE AS ONE OF HIS
TREES--I BELIEVE THERE IS TWO OF THEM. MY MOTHER SAYS THE ORCHARD WAS
ALWAYS FAMOUS IN HER YOUNGER DAYS. BUT I WAS REALLY QUITE SHOCKED THE
OTHER DAY--FOR MR. KNIGHTLEY CALLED ONE MORNING, AND JANE WAS EATING
THESE APPLES, AND WE TALKED ABOUT THEM AND SAID HOW MUCH SHE ENJOYED
THEM, AND HE ASKED WHETHER WE WERE NOT GOT TO THE END OF OUR STOCK. 'I
AM SURE YOU MUST BE,' SAID HE, 'AND I WILL SEND YOU ANOTHER SUPPLY; FOR
I HAVE A GREAT MANY MORE THAN I CAN EVER USE. WILLIAM LARKINS LET ME
KEEP A LARGER QUANTITY THAN USUAL THIS YEAR. I WILL SEND YOU SOME MORE,
BEFORE THEY GET GOOD FOR NOTHING.' SO I BEGGED HE WOULD NOT--FOR REALLY
AS TO OURS BEING GONE, I COULD NOT ABSOLUTELY SAY THAT WE HAD A GREAT
MANY LEFT--IT WAS BUT HALF A DOZEN INDEED; BUT THEY SHOULD BE ALL KEPT
FOR JANE; AND I COULD NOT AT ALL BEAR THAT HE SHOULD BE SENDING US MORE,
SO LIBERAL AS HE HAD BEEN ALREADY; AND JANE SAID THE SAME. AND WHEN
HE WAS GONE, SHE ALMOST QUARRELLED WITH ME--NO, I SHOULD NOT SAY
QUARRELLED, FOR WE NEVER HAD A QUARREL IN OUR LIVES; BUT SHE WAS QUITE
DISTRESSED THAT I HAD OWNED THE APPLES WERE SO NEARLY GONE; SHE WISHED
I HAD MADE HIM BELIEVE WE HAD A GREAT MANY LEFT. OH, SAID I, MY DEAR,
I DID SAY AS MUCH AS I COULD. HOWEVER, THE VERY SAME EVENING WILLIAM
LARKINS CAME OVER WITH A LARGE BASKET OF APPLES, THE SAME SORT OF
APPLES, A BUSHEL AT LEAST, AND I WAS VERY MUCH OBLIGED, AND WENT DOWN
AND SPOKE TO WILLIAM LARKINS AND SAID EVERY THING, AS YOU MAY SUPPOSE.
WILLIAM LARKINS IS SUCH AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE! I AM ALWAYS GLAD TO SEE
HIM. BUT, HOWEVER, I FOUND AFTERWARDS FROM PATTY, THAT WILLIAM SAID IT
WAS ALL THE APPLES OF THAT SORT HIS MASTER HAD; HE HAD BROUGHT THEM
ALL--AND NOW HIS MASTER HAD NOT ONE LEFT TO BAKE OR BOIL. WILLIAM DID
NOT SEEM TO MIND IT HIMSELF, HE WAS SO PLEASED TO THINK HIS MASTER HAD
SOLD SO MANY; FOR WILLIAM, YOU KNOW, THINKS MORE OF HIS MASTER'S PROFIT
THAN ANY THING; BUT MRS. HODGES, HE SAID, WAS QUITE DISPLEASED AT THEIR
BEING ALL SENT AWAY. SHE COULD NOT BEAR THAT HER MASTER SHOULD NOT BE
ABLE TO HAVE ANOTHER APPLE-TART THIS SPRING. HE TOLD PATTY THIS, BUT BID
HER NOT MIND IT, AND BE SURE NOT TO SAY ANY THING TO US ABOUT IT, FOR
MRS. HODGES WOULD BE CROSS SOMETIMES, AND AS LONG AS SO MANY SACKS
WERE SOLD, IT DID NOT SIGNIFY WHO ATE THE REMAINDER. AND SO PATTY TOLD
ME, AND I WAS EXCESSIVELY SHOCKED INDEED! I WOULD NOT HAVE MR. KNIGHTLEY
KNOW ANY THING ABOUT IT FOR THE WORLD! HE WOULD BE SO VERY.... I WANTED
TO KEEP IT FROM JANE'S KNOWLEDGE; BUT, UNLUCKILY, I HAD MENTIONED IT
BEFORE I WAS AWARE."

MISS BATES HAD JUST DONE AS PATTY OPENED THE DOOR; AND HER VISITORS
WALKED UPSTAIRS WITHOUT HAVING ANY REGULAR NARRATION TO ATTEND TO,
PURSUED ONLY BY THE SOUNDS OF HER DESULTORY GOOD-WILL.

"PRAY TAKE CARE, MRS. WESTON, THERE IS A STEP AT THE TURNING. PRAY TAKE
CARE, MISS WOODHOUSE, OURS IS RATHER A DARK STAIRCASE--RATHER DARKER
AND NARROWER THAN ONE COULD WISH. MISS SMITH, PRAY TAKE CARE. MISS
WOODHOUSE, I AM QUITE CONCERNED, I AM SURE YOU HIT YOUR FOOT. MISS
SMITH, THE STEP AT THE TURNING."



CHAPTER X


THE APPEARANCE OF THE LITTLE SITTING-ROOM AS THEY ENTERED, WAS
TRANQUILLITY ITSELF; MRS. BATES, DEPRIVED OF HER USUAL EMPLOYMENT,
SLUMBERING ON ONE SIDE OF THE FIRE, FRANK CHURCHILL, AT A TABLE NEAR
HER, MOST DEEDILY OCCUPIED ABOUT HER SPECTACLES, AND JANE FAIRFAX,
STANDING WITH HER BACK TO THEM, INTENT ON HER PIANOFORTE.

BUSY AS HE WAS, HOWEVER, THE YOUNG MAN WAS YET ABLE TO SHEW A MOST HAPPY
COUNTENANCE ON SEEING EMMA AGAIN.

"THIS IS A PLEASURE," SAID HE, IN RATHER A LOW VOICE, "COMING AT LEAST
TEN MINUTES EARLIER THAN I HAD CALCULATED. YOU FIND ME TRYING TO BE
USEFUL; TELL ME IF YOU THINK I SHALL SUCCEED."

"WHAT!" SAID MRS. WESTON, "HAVE NOT YOU FINISHED IT YET? YOU WOULD NOT
EARN A VERY GOOD LIVELIHOOD AS A WORKING SILVERSMITH AT THIS RATE."

"I HAVE NOT BEEN WORKING UNINTERRUPTEDLY," HE REPLIED, "I HAVE BEEN
ASSISTING MISS FAIRFAX IN TRYING TO MAKE HER INSTRUMENT STAND STEADILY,
IT WAS NOT QUITE FIRM; AN UNEVENNESS IN THE FLOOR, I BELIEVE. YOU SEE
WE HAVE BEEN WEDGING ONE LEG WITH PAPER. THIS WAS VERY KIND OF YOU TO BE
PERSUADED TO COME. I WAS ALMOST AFRAID YOU WOULD BE HURRYING HOME."

HE CONTRIVED THAT SHE SHOULD BE SEATED BY HIM; AND WAS SUFFICIENTLY
EMPLOYED IN LOOKING OUT THE BEST BAKED APPLE FOR HER, AND TRYING TO MAKE
HER HELP OR ADVISE HIM IN HIS WORK, TILL JANE FAIRFAX WAS QUITE READY
TO SIT DOWN TO THE PIANOFORTE AGAIN. THAT SHE WAS NOT IMMEDIATELY READY,
EMMA DID SUSPECT TO ARISE FROM THE STATE OF HER NERVES; SHE HAD NOT YET
POSSESSED THE INSTRUMENT LONG ENOUGH TO TOUCH IT WITHOUT EMOTION; SHE
MUST REASON HERSELF INTO THE POWER OF PERFORMANCE; AND EMMA COULD NOT
BUT PITY SUCH FEELINGS, WHATEVER THEIR ORIGIN, AND COULD NOT BUT RESOLVE
NEVER TO EXPOSE THEM TO HER NEIGHBOUR AGAIN.

AT LAST JANE BEGAN, AND THOUGH THE FIRST BARS WERE FEEBLY GIVEN, THE
POWERS OF THE INSTRUMENT WERE GRADUALLY DONE FULL JUSTICE TO. MRS.
WESTON HAD BEEN DELIGHTED BEFORE, AND WAS DELIGHTED AGAIN; EMMA
JOINED HER IN ALL HER PRAISE; AND THE PIANOFORTE, WITH EVERY PROPER
DISCRIMINATION, WAS PRONOUNCED TO BE ALTOGETHER OF THE HIGHEST PROMISE.

"WHOEVER COLONEL CAMPBELL MIGHT EMPLOY," SAID FRANK CHURCHILL, WITH A
SMILE AT EMMA, "THE PERSON HAS NOT CHOSEN ILL. I HEARD A GOOD DEAL OF
COLONEL CAMPBELL'S TASTE AT WEYMOUTH; AND THE SOFTNESS OF THE UPPER
NOTES I AM SURE IS EXACTLY WHAT HE AND ALL THAT PARTY WOULD
PARTICULARLY PRIZE. I DARE SAY, MISS FAIRFAX, THAT HE EITHER GAVE HIS
FRIEND VERY MINUTE DIRECTIONS, OR WROTE TO BROADWOOD HIMSELF. DO NOT YOU
THINK SO?"

JANE DID NOT LOOK ROUND. SHE WAS NOT OBLIGED TO HEAR. MRS. WESTON HAD
BEEN SPEAKING TO HER AT THE SAME MOMENT.

"IT IS NOT FAIR," SAID EMMA, IN A WHISPER; "MINE WAS A RANDOM GUESS. DO
NOT DISTRESS HER."

HE SHOOK HIS HEAD WITH A SMILE, AND LOOKED AS IF HE HAD VERY LITTLE
DOUBT AND VERY LITTLE MERCY. SOON AFTERWARDS HE BEGAN AGAIN,

"HOW MUCH YOUR FRIENDS IN IRELAND MUST BE ENJOYING YOUR PLEASURE ON THIS
OCCASION, MISS FAIRFAX. I DARE SAY THEY OFTEN THINK OF YOU, AND WONDER
WHICH WILL BE THE DAY, THE PRECISE DAY OF THE INSTRUMENT'S COMING TO
HAND. DO YOU IMAGINE COLONEL CAMPBELL KNOWS THE BUSINESS TO BE GOING
FORWARD JUST AT THIS TIME?--DO YOU IMAGINE IT TO BE THE CONSEQUENCE
OF AN IMMEDIATE COMMISSION FROM HIM, OR THAT HE MAY HAVE SENT ONLY
A GENERAL DIRECTION, AN ORDER INDEFINITE AS TO TIME, TO DEPEND UPON
CONTINGENCIES AND CONVENIENCES?"

HE PAUSED. SHE COULD NOT BUT HEAR; SHE COULD NOT AVOID ANSWERING,

"TILL I HAVE A LETTER FROM COLONEL CAMPBELL," SAID SHE, IN A VOICE OF
FORCED CALMNESS, "I CAN IMAGINE NOTHING WITH ANY CONFIDENCE. IT MUST BE
ALL CONJECTURE."

"CONJECTURE--AYE, SOMETIMES ONE CONJECTURES RIGHT, AND SOMETIMES ONE
CONJECTURES WRONG. I WISH I COULD CONJECTURE HOW SOON I SHALL MAKE THIS
RIVET QUITE FIRM. WHAT NONSENSE ONE TALKS, MISS WOODHOUSE, WHEN HARD
AT WORK, IF ONE TALKS AT ALL;--YOUR REAL WORKMEN, I SUPPOSE, HOLD THEIR
TONGUES; BUT WE GENTLEMEN LABOURERS IF WE GET HOLD OF A WORD--MISS
FAIRFAX SAID SOMETHING ABOUT CONJECTURING. THERE, IT IS DONE. I HAVE THE
PLEASURE, MADAM, (TO MRS. BATES,) OF RESTORING YOUR SPECTACLES, HEALED
FOR THE PRESENT."

HE WAS VERY WARMLY THANKED BOTH BY MOTHER AND DAUGHTER; TO ESCAPE A
LITTLE FROM THE LATTER, HE WENT TO THE PIANOFORTE, AND BEGGED MISS
FAIRFAX, WHO WAS STILL SITTING AT IT, TO PLAY SOMETHING MORE.

"IF YOU ARE VERY KIND," SAID HE, "IT WILL BE ONE OF THE WALTZES WE
DANCED LAST NIGHT;--LET ME LIVE THEM OVER AGAIN. YOU DID NOT ENJOY THEM
AS I DID; YOU APPEARED TIRED THE WHOLE TIME. I BELIEVE YOU WERE GLAD WE
DANCED NO LONGER; BUT I WOULD HAVE GIVEN WORLDS--ALL THE WORLDS ONE EVER
HAS TO GIVE--FOR ANOTHER HALF-HOUR."

SHE PLAYED.

"WHAT FELICITY IT IS TO HEAR A TUNE AGAIN WHICH HAS MADE ONE
HAPPY!--IF I MISTAKE NOT THAT WAS DANCED AT WEYMOUTH."

SHE LOOKED UP AT HIM FOR A MOMENT, COLOURED DEEPLY, AND PLAYED SOMETHING
ELSE. HE TOOK SOME MUSIC FROM A CHAIR NEAR THE PIANOFORTE, AND TURNING
TO EMMA, SAID,

"HERE IS SOMETHING QUITE NEW TO ME. DO YOU KNOW IT?--CRAMER.--AND HERE
ARE A NEW SET OF IRISH MELODIES. THAT, FROM SUCH A QUARTER, ONE MIGHT
EXPECT. THIS WAS ALL SENT WITH THE INSTRUMENT. VERY THOUGHTFUL OF
COLONEL CAMPBELL, WAS NOT IT?--HE KNEW MISS FAIRFAX COULD HAVE NO MUSIC
HERE. I HONOUR THAT PART OF THE ATTENTION PARTICULARLY; IT SHEWS IT TO
HAVE BEEN SO THOROUGHLY FROM THE HEART. NOTHING HASTILY DONE; NOTHING
INCOMPLETE. TRUE AFFECTION ONLY COULD HAVE PROMPTED IT."

EMMA WISHED HE WOULD BE LESS POINTED, YET COULD NOT HELP BEING AMUSED;
AND WHEN ON GLANCING HER EYE TOWARDS JANE FAIRFAX SHE CAUGHT THE REMAINS
OF A SMILE, WHEN SHE SAW THAT WITH ALL THE DEEP BLUSH OF CONSCIOUSNESS,
THERE HAD BEEN A SMILE OF SECRET DELIGHT, SHE HAD LESS SCRUPLE IN THE
AMUSEMENT, AND MUCH LESS COMPUNCTION WITH RESPECT TO HER.--THIS
AMIABLE, UPRIGHT, PERFECT JANE FAIRFAX WAS APPARENTLY CHERISHING VERY
REPREHENSIBLE FEELINGS.

HE BROUGHT ALL THE MUSIC TO HER, AND THEY LOOKED IT OVER TOGETHER.--EMMA
TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY OF WHISPERING,

"YOU SPEAK TOO PLAIN. SHE MUST UNDERSTAND YOU."

"I HOPE SHE DOES. I WOULD HAVE HER UNDERSTAND ME. I AM NOT IN THE LEAST
ASHAMED OF MY MEANING."

"BUT REALLY, I AM HALF ASHAMED, AND WISH I HAD NEVER TAKEN UP THE IDEA."

"I AM VERY GLAD YOU DID, AND THAT YOU COMMUNICATED IT TO ME. I HAVE NOW
A KEY TO ALL HER ODD LOOKS AND WAYS. LEAVE SHAME TO HER. IF SHE DOES
WRONG, SHE OUGHT TO FEEL IT."

"SHE IS NOT ENTIRELY WITHOUT IT, I THINK."

"I DO NOT SEE MUCH SIGN OF IT. SHE IS PLAYING ROBIN ADAIR AT THIS
MOMENT--HIS FAVOURITE."

SHORTLY AFTERWARDS MISS BATES, PASSING NEAR THE WINDOW, DESCRIED MR.
KNIGHTLEY ON HORSE-BACK NOT FAR OFF.

"MR. KNIGHTLEY I DECLARE!--I MUST SPEAK TO HIM IF POSSIBLE, JUST TO
THANK HIM. I WILL NOT OPEN THE WINDOW HERE; IT WOULD GIVE YOU ALL COLD;
BUT I CAN GO INTO MY MOTHER'S ROOM YOU KNOW. I DARE SAY HE WILL COME
IN WHEN HE KNOWS WHO IS HERE. QUITE DELIGHTFUL TO HAVE YOU ALL MEET
SO!--OUR LITTLE ROOM SO HONOURED!"

SHE WAS IN THE ADJOINING CHAMBER WHILE SHE STILL SPOKE, AND OPENING THE
CASEMENT THERE, IMMEDIATELY CALLED MR. KNIGHTLEY'S ATTENTION, AND EVERY
SYLLABLE OF THEIR CONVERSATION WAS AS DISTINCTLY HEARD BY THE OTHERS, AS
IF IT HAD PASSED WITHIN THE SAME APARTMENT.

"HOW D' YE DO?--HOW D'YE DO?--VERY WELL, I THANK YOU. SO OBLIGED TO YOU
FOR THE CARRIAGE LAST NIGHT. WE WERE JUST IN TIME; MY MOTHER JUST READY
FOR US. PRAY COME IN; DO COME IN. YOU WILL FIND SOME FRIENDS HERE."

SO BEGAN MISS BATES; AND MR. KNIGHTLEY SEEMED DETERMINED TO BE HEARD IN
HIS TURN, FOR MOST RESOLUTELY AND COMMANDINGLY DID HE SAY,

"HOW IS YOUR NIECE, MISS BATES?--I WANT TO INQUIRE AFTER YOU ALL, BUT
PARTICULARLY YOUR NIECE. HOW IS MISS FAIRFAX?--I HOPE SHE CAUGHT NO COLD
LAST NIGHT. HOW IS SHE TO-DAY? TELL ME HOW MISS FAIRFAX IS."

AND MISS BATES WAS OBLIGED TO GIVE A DIRECT ANSWER BEFORE HE WOULD HEAR
HER IN ANY THING ELSE. THE LISTENERS WERE AMUSED; AND MRS. WESTON GAVE
EMMA A LOOK OF PARTICULAR MEANING. BUT EMMA STILL SHOOK HER HEAD IN
STEADY SCEPTICISM.

"SO OBLIGED TO YOU!--SO VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU FOR THE CARRIAGE,"
RESUMED MISS BATES.

HE CUT HER SHORT WITH,

"I AM GOING TO KINGSTON. CAN I DO ANY THING FOR YOU?"

"OH! DEAR, KINGSTON--ARE YOU?--MRS. COLE WAS SAYING THE OTHER DAY SHE
WANTED SOMETHING FROM KINGSTON."

"MRS. COLE HAS SERVANTS TO SEND. CAN I DO ANY THING FOR YOU?"

"NO, I THANK YOU. BUT DO COME IN. WHO DO YOU THINK IS HERE?--MISS
WOODHOUSE AND MISS SMITH; SO KIND AS TO CALL TO HEAR THE NEW PIANOFORTE.
DO PUT UP YOUR HORSE AT THE CROWN, AND COME IN."

"WELL," SAID HE, IN A DELIBERATING MANNER, "FOR FIVE MINUTES, PERHAPS."

"AND HERE IS MRS. WESTON AND MR. FRANK CHURCHILL TOO!--QUITE DELIGHTFUL;
SO MANY FRIENDS!"

"NO, NOT NOW, I THANK YOU. I COULD NOT STAY TWO MINUTES. I MUST GET ON
TO KINGSTON AS FAST AS I CAN."

"OH! DO COME IN. THEY WILL BE SO VERY HAPPY TO SEE YOU."

"NO, NO; YOUR ROOM IS FULL ENOUGH. I WILL CALL ANOTHER DAY, AND HEAR THE
PIANOFORTE."

"WELL, I AM SO SORRY!--OH! MR. KNIGHTLEY, WHAT A DELIGHTFUL PARTY LAST
NIGHT; HOW EXTREMELY PLEASANT.--DID YOU EVER SEE SUCH DANCING?--WAS NOT
IT DELIGHTFUL?--MISS WOODHOUSE AND MR. FRANK CHURCHILL; I NEVER SAW ANY
THING EQUAL TO IT."

"OH! VERY DELIGHTFUL INDEED; I CAN SAY NOTHING LESS, FOR I SUPPOSE MISS
WOODHOUSE AND MR. FRANK CHURCHILL ARE HEARING EVERY THING THAT PASSES.
AND (RAISING HIS VOICE STILL MORE) I DO NOT SEE WHY MISS FAIRFAX SHOULD
NOT BE MENTIONED TOO. I THINK MISS FAIRFAX DANCES VERY WELL; AND MRS.
WESTON IS THE VERY BEST COUNTRY-DANCE PLAYER, WITHOUT EXCEPTION,
IN ENGLAND. NOW, IF YOUR FRIENDS HAVE ANY GRATITUDE, THEY WILL SAY
SOMETHING PRETTY LOUD ABOUT YOU AND ME IN RETURN; BUT I CANNOT STAY TO
HEAR IT."

"OH! MR. KNIGHTLEY, ONE MOMENT MORE; SOMETHING OF CONSEQUENCE--SO
SHOCKED!--JANE AND I ARE BOTH SO SHOCKED ABOUT THE APPLES!"

"WHAT IS THE MATTER NOW?"

"TO THINK OF YOUR SENDING US ALL YOUR STORE APPLES. YOU SAID YOU HAD
A GREAT MANY, AND NOW YOU HAVE NOT ONE LEFT. WE REALLY ARE SO SHOCKED!
MRS. HODGES MAY WELL BE ANGRY. WILLIAM LARKINS MENTIONED IT HERE. YOU
SHOULD NOT HAVE DONE IT, INDEED YOU SHOULD NOT. AH! HE IS OFF. HE NEVER
CAN BEAR TO BE THANKED. BUT I THOUGHT HE WOULD HAVE STAID NOW, AND IT
WOULD HAVE BEEN A PITY NOT TO HAVE MENTIONED.... WELL, (RETURNING TO THE
ROOM,) I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO SUCCEED. MR. KNIGHTLEY CANNOT STOP. HE IS
GOING TO KINGSTON. HE ASKED ME IF HE COULD DO ANY THING...."

"YES," SAID JANE, "WE HEARD HIS KIND OFFERS, WE HEARD EVERY THING."

"OH! YES, MY DEAR, I DARE SAY YOU MIGHT, BECAUSE YOU KNOW, THE DOOR WAS
OPEN, AND THE WINDOW WAS OPEN, AND MR. KNIGHTLEY SPOKE LOUD. YOU MUST
HAVE HEARD EVERY THING TO BE SURE. 'CAN I DO ANY THING FOR YOU AT
KINGSTON?' SAID HE; SO I JUST MENTIONED.... OH! MISS WOODHOUSE, MUST YOU
BE GOING?--YOU SEEM BUT JUST COME--SO VERY OBLIGING OF YOU."

EMMA FOUND IT REALLY TIME TO BE AT HOME; THE VISIT HAD ALREADY LASTED
LONG; AND ON EXAMINING WATCHES, SO MUCH OF THE MORNING WAS PERCEIVED
TO BE GONE, THAT MRS. WESTON AND HER COMPANION TAKING LEAVE ALSO, COULD
ALLOW THEMSELVES ONLY TO WALK WITH THE TWO YOUNG LADIES TO HARTFIELD
GATES, BEFORE THEY SET OFF FOR RANDALLS.



CHAPTER XI


IT MAY BE POSSIBLE TO DO WITHOUT DANCING ENTIRELY. INSTANCES HAVE BEEN
KNOWN OF YOUNG PEOPLE PASSING MANY, MANY MONTHS SUCCESSIVELY, WITHOUT
BEING AT ANY BALL OF ANY DESCRIPTION, AND NO MATERIAL INJURY ACCRUE
EITHER TO BODY OR MIND;--BUT WHEN A BEGINNING IS MADE--WHEN THE
FELICITIES OF RAPID MOTION HAVE ONCE BEEN, THOUGH SLIGHTLY, FELT--IT
MUST BE A VERY HEAVY SET THAT DOES NOT ASK FOR MORE.

FRANK CHURCHILL HAD DANCED ONCE AT HIGHBURY, AND LONGED TO DANCE AGAIN;
AND THE LAST HALF-HOUR OF AN EVENING WHICH MR. WOODHOUSE WAS PERSUADED
TO SPEND WITH HIS DAUGHTER AT RANDALLS, WAS PASSED BY THE TWO YOUNG
PEOPLE IN SCHEMES ON THE SUBJECT. FRANK'S WAS THE FIRST IDEA; AND HIS
THE GREATEST ZEAL IN PURSUING IT; FOR THE LADY WAS THE BEST JUDGE OF THE
DIFFICULTIES, AND THE MOST SOLICITOUS FOR ACCOMMODATION AND APPEARANCE.
BUT STILL SHE HAD INCLINATION ENOUGH FOR SHEWING PEOPLE AGAIN HOW
DELIGHTFULLY MR. FRANK CHURCHILL AND MISS WOODHOUSE DANCED--FOR
DOING THAT IN WHICH SHE NEED NOT BLUSH TO COMPARE HERSELF WITH JANE
FAIRFAX--AND EVEN FOR SIMPLE DANCING ITSELF, WITHOUT ANY OF THE WICKED
AIDS OF VANITY--TO ASSIST HIM FIRST IN PACING OUT THE ROOM THEY WERE IN
TO SEE WHAT IT COULD BE MADE TO HOLD--AND THEN IN TAKING THE DIMENSIONS
OF THE OTHER PARLOUR, IN THE HOPE OF DISCOVERING, IN SPITE OF ALL THAT
MR. WESTON COULD SAY OF THEIR EXACTLY EQUAL SIZE, THAT IT WAS A LITTLE
THE LARGEST.

HIS FIRST PROPOSITION AND REQUEST, THAT THE DANCE BEGUN AT MR. COLE'S
SHOULD BE FINISHED THERE--THAT THE SAME PARTY SHOULD BE COLLECTED,
AND THE SAME MUSICIAN ENGAGED, MET WITH THE READIEST ACQUIESCENCE. MR.
WESTON ENTERED INTO THE IDEA WITH THOROUGH ENJOYMENT, AND MRS. WESTON
MOST WILLINGLY UNDERTOOK TO PLAY AS LONG AS THEY COULD WISH TO DANCE;
AND THE INTERESTING EMPLOYMENT HAD FOLLOWED, OF RECKONING UP EXACTLY WHO
THERE WOULD BE, AND PORTIONING OUT THE INDISPENSABLE DIVISION OF SPACE
TO EVERY COUPLE.

"YOU AND MISS SMITH, AND MISS FAIRFAX, WILL BE THREE, AND THE TWO MISS
COXES FIVE," HAD BEEN REPEATED MANY TIMES OVER. "AND THERE WILL BE THE
TWO GILBERTS, YOUNG COX, MY FATHER, AND MYSELF, BESIDES MR. KNIGHTLEY.
YES, THAT WILL BE QUITE ENOUGH FOR PLEASURE. YOU AND MISS SMITH, AND
MISS FAIRFAX, WILL BE THREE, AND THE TWO MISS COXES FIVE; AND FOR FIVE
COUPLE THERE WILL BE PLENTY OF ROOM."

BUT SOON IT CAME TO BE ON ONE SIDE,

"BUT WILL THERE BE GOOD ROOM FOR FIVE COUPLE?--I REALLY DO NOT THINK
THERE WILL."

ON ANOTHER,

"AND AFTER ALL, FIVE COUPLE ARE NOT ENOUGH TO MAKE IT WORTH WHILE TO
STAND UP. FIVE COUPLE ARE NOTHING, WHEN ONE THINKS SERIOUSLY ABOUT IT.
IT WILL NOT DO TO INVITE FIVE COUPLE. IT CAN BE ALLOWABLE ONLY AS THE
THOUGHT OF THE MOMENT."

SOMEBODY SAID THAT MISS GILBERT WAS EXPECTED AT HER BROTHER'S, AND
MUST BE INVITED WITH THE REST. SOMEBODY ELSE BELIEVED MRS. GILBERT
WOULD HAVE DANCED THE OTHER EVENING, IF SHE HAD BEEN ASKED. A WORD WAS
PUT IN FOR A SECOND YOUNG COX; AND AT LAST, MR. WESTON NAMING ONE FAMILY
OF COUSINS WHO MUST BE INCLUDED, AND ANOTHER OF VERY OLD ACQUAINTANCE
WHO COULD NOT BE LEFT OUT, IT BECAME A CERTAINTY THAT THE FIVE COUPLE
WOULD BE AT LEAST TEN, AND A VERY INTERESTING SPECULATION IN WHAT
POSSIBLE MANNER THEY COULD BE DISPOSED OF.

THE DOORS OF THE TWO ROOMS WERE JUST OPPOSITE EACH OTHER. "MIGHT NOT
THEY USE BOTH ROOMS, AND DANCE ACROSS THE PASSAGE?" IT SEEMED THE
BEST SCHEME; AND YET IT WAS NOT SO GOOD BUT THAT MANY OF THEM WANTED A
BETTER. EMMA SAID IT WOULD BE AWKWARD; MRS. WESTON WAS IN DISTRESS ABOUT
THE SUPPER; AND MR. WOODHOUSE OPPOSED IT EARNESTLY, ON THE SCORE OF
HEALTH. IT MADE HIM SO VERY UNHAPPY, INDEED, THAT IT COULD NOT BE
PERSEVERED IN.

"OH! NO," SAID HE; "IT WOULD BE THE EXTREME OF IMPRUDENCE. I COULD NOT
BEAR IT FOR EMMA!--EMMA IS NOT STRONG. SHE WOULD CATCH A DREADFUL COLD.
SO WOULD POOR LITTLE HARRIET. SO YOU WOULD ALL. MRS. WESTON, YOU WOULD
BE QUITE LAID UP; DO NOT LET THEM TALK OF SUCH A WILD THING. PRAY DO
NOT LET THEM TALK OF IT. THAT YOUNG MAN (SPEAKING LOWER) IS VERY
THOUGHTLESS. DO NOT TELL HIS FATHER, BUT THAT YOUNG MAN IS NOT QUITE
THE THING. HE HAS BEEN OPENING THE DOORS VERY OFTEN THIS EVENING,
AND KEEPING THEM OPEN VERY INCONSIDERATELY. HE DOES NOT THINK OF THE
DRAUGHT. I DO NOT MEAN TO SET YOU AGAINST HIM, BUT INDEED HE IS NOT
QUITE THE THING!"

MRS. WESTON WAS SORRY FOR SUCH A CHARGE. SHE KNEW THE IMPORTANCE OF
IT, AND SAID EVERY THING IN HER POWER TO DO IT AWAY. EVERY DOOR WAS NOW
CLOSED, THE PASSAGE PLAN GIVEN UP, AND THE FIRST SCHEME OF DANCING ONLY
IN THE ROOM THEY WERE IN RESORTED TO AGAIN; AND WITH SUCH GOOD-WILL ON
FRANK CHURCHILL'S PART, THAT THE SPACE WHICH A QUARTER OF AN HOUR BEFORE
HAD BEEN DEEMED BARELY SUFFICIENT FOR FIVE COUPLE, WAS NOW ENDEAVOURED
TO BE MADE OUT QUITE ENOUGH FOR TEN.

"WE WERE TOO MAGNIFICENT," SAID HE. "WE ALLOWED UNNECESSARY ROOM. TEN
COUPLE MAY STAND HERE VERY WELL."

EMMA DEMURRED. "IT WOULD BE A CROWD--A SAD CROWD; AND WHAT COULD BE
WORSE THAN DANCING WITHOUT SPACE TO TURN IN?"

"VERY TRUE," HE GRAVELY REPLIED; "IT WAS VERY BAD." BUT STILL HE WENT ON
MEASURING, AND STILL HE ENDED WITH,

"I THINK THERE WILL BE VERY TOLERABLE ROOM FOR TEN COUPLE."

"NO, NO," SAID SHE, "YOU ARE QUITE UNREASONABLE. IT WOULD BE DREADFUL
TO BE STANDING SO CLOSE! NOTHING CAN BE FARTHER FROM PLEASURE THAN TO BE
DANCING IN A CROWD--AND A CROWD IN A LITTLE ROOM!"

"THERE IS NO DENYING IT," HE REPLIED. "I AGREE WITH YOU EXACTLY. A CROWD
IN A LITTLE ROOM--MISS WOODHOUSE, YOU HAVE THE ART OF GIVING PICTURES
IN A FEW WORDS. EXQUISITE, QUITE EXQUISITE!--STILL, HOWEVER, HAVING
PROCEEDED SO FAR, ONE IS UNWILLING TO GIVE THE MATTER UP. IT WOULD BE
A DISAPPOINTMENT TO MY FATHER--AND ALTOGETHER--I DO NOT KNOW THAT--I AM
RATHER OF OPINION THAT TEN COUPLE MIGHT STAND HERE VERY WELL."

EMMA PERCEIVED THAT THE NATURE OF HIS GALLANTRY WAS A LITTLE
SELF-WILLED, AND THAT HE WOULD RATHER OPPOSE THAN LOSE THE PLEASURE OF
DANCING WITH HER; BUT SHE TOOK THE COMPLIMENT, AND FORGAVE THE REST.
HAD SHE INTENDED EVER TO MARRY HIM, IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN WORTH WHILE TO
PAUSE AND CONSIDER, AND TRY TO UNDERSTAND THE VALUE OF HIS PREFERENCE,
AND THE CHARACTER OF HIS TEMPER; BUT FOR ALL THE PURPOSES OF THEIR
ACQUAINTANCE, HE WAS QUITE AMIABLE ENOUGH.

BEFORE THE MIDDLE OF THE NEXT DAY, HE WAS AT HARTFIELD; AND HE ENTERED
THE ROOM WITH SUCH AN AGREEABLE SMILE AS CERTIFIED THE CONTINUANCE OF
THE SCHEME. IT SOON APPEARED THAT HE CAME TO ANNOUNCE AN IMPROVEMENT.

"WELL, MISS WOODHOUSE," HE ALMOST IMMEDIATELY BEGAN, "YOUR INCLINATION
FOR DANCING HAS NOT BEEN QUITE FRIGHTENED AWAY, I HOPE, BY THE TERRORS
OF MY FATHER'S LITTLE ROOMS. I BRING A NEW PROPOSAL ON THE SUBJECT:--A
THOUGHT OF MY FATHER'S, WHICH WAITS ONLY YOUR APPROBATION TO BE ACTED
UPON. MAY I HOPE FOR THE HONOUR OF YOUR HAND FOR THE TWO FIRST DANCES
OF THIS LITTLE PROJECTED BALL, TO BE GIVEN, NOT AT RANDALLS, BUT AT THE
CROWN INN?"

"THE CROWN!"

"YES; IF YOU AND MR. WOODHOUSE SEE NO OBJECTION, AND I TRUST YOU CANNOT,
MY FATHER HOPES HIS FRIENDS WILL BE SO KIND AS TO VISIT HIM THERE.
BETTER ACCOMMODATIONS, HE CAN PROMISE THEM, AND NOT A LESS GRATEFUL
WELCOME THAN AT RANDALLS. IT IS HIS OWN IDEA. MRS. WESTON SEES NO
OBJECTION TO IT, PROVIDED YOU ARE SATISFIED. THIS IS WHAT WE ALL FEEL.
OH! YOU WERE PERFECTLY RIGHT! TEN COUPLE, IN EITHER OF THE RANDALLS
ROOMS, WOULD HAVE BEEN INSUFFERABLE!--DREADFUL!--I FELT HOW RIGHT YOU
WERE THE WHOLE TIME, BUT WAS TOO ANXIOUS FOR SECURING ANY THING
TO LIKE TO YIELD. IS NOT IT A GOOD EXCHANGE?--YOU CONSENT--I HOPE YOU
CONSENT?"

"IT APPEARS TO ME A PLAN THAT NOBODY CAN OBJECT TO, IF MR. AND MRS.
WESTON DO NOT. I THINK IT ADMIRABLE; AND, AS FAR AS I CAN ANSWER FOR
MYSELF, SHALL BE MOST HAPPY--IT SEEMS THE ONLY IMPROVEMENT THAT COULD
BE. PAPA, DO YOU NOT THINK IT AN EXCELLENT IMPROVEMENT?"

SHE WAS OBLIGED TO REPEAT AND EXPLAIN IT, BEFORE IT WAS FULLY
COMPREHENDED; AND THEN, BEING QUITE NEW, FARTHER REPRESENTATIONS WERE
NECESSARY TO MAKE IT ACCEPTABLE.

"NO; HE THOUGHT IT VERY FAR FROM AN IMPROVEMENT--A VERY BAD PLAN--MUCH
WORSE THAN THE OTHER. A ROOM AT AN INN WAS ALWAYS DAMP AND DANGEROUS;
NEVER PROPERLY AIRED, OR FIT TO BE INHABITED. IF THEY MUST DANCE, THEY
HAD BETTER DANCE AT RANDALLS. HE HAD NEVER BEEN IN THE ROOM AT THE CROWN
IN HIS LIFE--DID NOT KNOW THE PEOPLE WHO KEPT IT BY SIGHT.--OH! NO--A
VERY BAD PLAN. THEY WOULD CATCH WORSE COLDS AT THE CROWN THAN ANYWHERE."

"I WAS GOING TO OBSERVE, SIR," SAID FRANK CHURCHILL, "THAT ONE OF THE
GREAT RECOMMENDATIONS OF THIS CHANGE WOULD BE THE VERY LITTLE DANGER
OF ANY BODY'S CATCHING COLD--SO MUCH LESS DANGER AT THE CROWN THAN AT
RANDALLS! MR. PERRY MIGHT HAVE REASON TO REGRET THE ALTERATION, BUT
NOBODY ELSE COULD."

"SIR," SAID MR. WOODHOUSE, RATHER WARMLY, "YOU ARE VERY MUCH MISTAKEN
IF YOU SUPPOSE MR. PERRY TO BE THAT SORT OF CHARACTER. MR. PERRY IS
EXTREMELY CONCERNED WHEN ANY OF US ARE ILL. BUT I DO NOT UNDERSTAND HOW
THE ROOM AT THE CROWN CAN BE SAFER FOR YOU THAN YOUR FATHER'S HOUSE."

"FROM THE VERY CIRCUMSTANCE OF ITS BEING LARGER, SIR. WE SHALL HAVE NO
OCCASION TO OPEN THE WINDOWS AT ALL--NOT ONCE THE WHOLE EVENING; AND IT
IS THAT DREADFUL HABIT OF OPENING THE WINDOWS, LETTING IN COLD AIR UPON
HEATED BODIES, WHICH (AS YOU WELL KNOW, SIR) DOES THE MISCHIEF."

"OPEN THE WINDOWS!--BUT SURELY, MR. CHURCHILL, NOBODY WOULD THINK OF
OPENING THE WINDOWS AT RANDALLS. NOBODY COULD BE SO IMPRUDENT! I NEVER
HEARD OF SUCH A THING. DANCING WITH OPEN WINDOWS!--I AM SURE, NEITHER
YOUR FATHER NOR MRS. WESTON (POOR MISS TAYLOR THAT WAS) WOULD SUFFER
IT."

"AH! SIR--BUT A THOUGHTLESS YOUNG PERSON WILL SOMETIMES STEP BEHIND A
WINDOW-CURTAIN, AND THROW UP A SASH, WITHOUT ITS BEING SUSPECTED. I HAVE
OFTEN KNOWN IT DONE MYSELF."

"HAVE YOU INDEED, SIR?--BLESS ME! I NEVER COULD HAVE SUPPOSED IT. BUT I
LIVE OUT OF THE WORLD, AND AM OFTEN ASTONISHED AT WHAT I HEAR. HOWEVER,
THIS DOES MAKE A DIFFERENCE; AND, PERHAPS, WHEN WE COME TO TALK IT
OVER--BUT THESE SORT OF THINGS REQUIRE A GOOD DEAL OF CONSIDERATION. ONE
CANNOT RESOLVE UPON THEM IN A HURRY. IF MR. AND MRS. WESTON WILL BE SO
OBLIGING AS TO CALL HERE ONE MORNING, WE MAY TALK IT OVER, AND SEE WHAT
CAN BE DONE."

"BUT, UNFORTUNATELY, SIR, MY TIME IS SO LIMITED--"

"OH!" INTERRUPTED EMMA, "THERE WILL BE PLENTY OF TIME FOR TALKING EVERY
THING OVER. THERE IS NO HURRY AT ALL. IF IT CAN BE CONTRIVED TO BE AT
THE CROWN, PAPA, IT WILL BE VERY CONVENIENT FOR THE HORSES. THEY WILL BE
SO NEAR THEIR OWN STABLE."

"SO THEY WILL, MY DEAR. THAT IS A GREAT THING. NOT THAT JAMES EVER
COMPLAINS; BUT IT IS RIGHT TO SPARE OUR HORSES WHEN WE CAN. IF I COULD
BE SURE OF THE ROOMS BEING THOROUGHLY AIRED--BUT IS MRS. STOKES TO BE
TRUSTED? I DOUBT IT. I DO NOT KNOW HER, EVEN BY SIGHT."

"I CAN ANSWER FOR EVERY THING OF THAT NATURE, SIR, BECAUSE IT WILL BE
UNDER MRS. WESTON'S CARE. MRS. WESTON UNDERTAKES TO DIRECT THE WHOLE."

"THERE, PAPA!--NOW YOU MUST BE SATISFIED--OUR OWN DEAR MRS. WESTON, WHO
IS CAREFULNESS ITSELF. DO NOT YOU REMEMBER WHAT MR. PERRY SAID, SO MANY
YEARS AGO, WHEN I HAD THE MEASLES? 'IF MISS TAYLOR UNDERTAKES TO
WRAP MISS EMMA UP, YOU NEED NOT HAVE ANY FEARS, SIR.' HOW OFTEN HAVE I
HEARD YOU SPEAK OF IT AS SUCH A COMPLIMENT TO HER!"

"AYE, VERY TRUE. MR. PERRY DID SAY SO. I SHALL NEVER FORGET IT. POOR
LITTLE EMMA! YOU WERE VERY BAD WITH THE MEASLES; THAT IS, YOU WOULD HAVE
BEEN VERY BAD, BUT FOR PERRY'S GREAT ATTENTION. HE CAME FOUR TIMES A DAY
FOR A WEEK. HE SAID, FROM THE FIRST, IT WAS A VERY GOOD SORT--WHICH
WAS OUR GREAT COMFORT; BUT THE MEASLES ARE A DREADFUL COMPLAINT. I HOPE
WHENEVER POOR ISABELLA'S LITTLE ONES HAVE THE MEASLES, SHE WILL SEND FOR
PERRY."

"MY FATHER AND MRS. WESTON ARE AT THE CROWN AT THIS MOMENT," SAID FRANK
CHURCHILL, "EXAMINING THE CAPABILITIES OF THE HOUSE. I LEFT THEM THERE
AND CAME ON TO HARTFIELD, IMPATIENT FOR YOUR OPINION, AND HOPING YOU
MIGHT BE PERSUADED TO JOIN THEM AND GIVE YOUR ADVICE ON THE SPOT. I WAS
DESIRED TO SAY SO FROM BOTH. IT WOULD BE THE GREATEST PLEASURE TO
THEM, IF YOU COULD ALLOW ME TO ATTEND YOU THERE. THEY CAN DO NOTHING
SATISFACTORILY WITHOUT YOU."

EMMA WAS MOST HAPPY TO BE CALLED TO SUCH A COUNCIL; AND HER FATHER,
ENGAGING TO THINK IT ALL OVER WHILE SHE WAS GONE, THE TWO YOUNG PEOPLE
SET OFF TOGETHER WITHOUT DELAY FOR THE CROWN. THERE WERE MR. AND MRS.
WESTON; DELIGHTED TO SEE HER AND RECEIVE HER APPROBATION, VERY BUSY AND
VERY HAPPY IN THEIR DIFFERENT WAY; SHE, IN SOME LITTLE DISTRESS; AND HE,
FINDING EVERY THING PERFECT.

"EMMA," SAID SHE, "THIS PAPER IS WORSE THAN I EXPECTED. LOOK! IN PLACES
YOU SEE IT IS DREADFULLY DIRTY; AND THE WAINSCOT IS MORE YELLOW AND
FORLORN THAN ANY THING I COULD HAVE IMAGINED."

"MY DEAR, YOU ARE TOO PARTICULAR," SAID HER HUSBAND. "WHAT DOES ALL THAT
SIGNIFY? YOU WILL SEE NOTHING OF IT BY CANDLELIGHT. IT WILL BE AS
CLEAN AS RANDALLS BY CANDLELIGHT. WE NEVER SEE ANY THING OF IT ON OUR
CLUB-NIGHTS."

THE LADIES HERE PROBABLY EXCHANGED LOOKS WHICH MEANT, "MEN NEVER KNOW
WHEN THINGS ARE DIRTY OR NOT;" AND THE GENTLEMEN PERHAPS THOUGHT EACH TO
HIMSELF, "WOMEN WILL HAVE THEIR LITTLE NONSENSES AND NEEDLESS CARES."

ONE PERPLEXITY, HOWEVER, AROSE, WHICH THE GENTLEMEN DID NOT DISDAIN.
IT REGARDED A SUPPER-ROOM. AT THE TIME OF THE BALLROOM'S BEING BUILT,
SUPPERS HAD NOT BEEN IN QUESTION; AND A SMALL CARD-ROOM ADJOINING, WAS
THE ONLY ADDITION. WHAT WAS TO BE DONE? THIS CARD-ROOM WOULD BE WANTED
AS A CARD-ROOM NOW; OR, IF CARDS WERE CONVENIENTLY VOTED UNNECESSARY
BY THEIR FOUR SELVES, STILL WAS IT NOT TOO SMALL FOR ANY COMFORTABLE
SUPPER? ANOTHER ROOM OF MUCH BETTER SIZE MIGHT BE SECURED FOR THE
PURPOSE; BUT IT WAS AT THE OTHER END OF THE HOUSE, AND A LONG AWKWARD
PASSAGE MUST BE GONE THROUGH TO GET AT IT. THIS MADE A DIFFICULTY. MRS.
WESTON WAS AFRAID OF DRAUGHTS FOR THE YOUNG PEOPLE IN THAT PASSAGE;
AND NEITHER EMMA NOR THE GENTLEMEN COULD TOLERATE THE PROSPECT OF BEING
MISERABLY CROWDED AT SUPPER.

MRS. WESTON PROPOSED HAVING NO REGULAR SUPPER; MERELY SANDWICHES,
ETC., SET OUT IN THE LITTLE ROOM; BUT THAT WAS SCOUTED AS A WRETCHED
SUGGESTION. A PRIVATE DANCE, WITHOUT SITTING DOWN TO SUPPER, WAS
PRONOUNCED AN INFAMOUS FRAUD UPON THE RIGHTS OF MEN AND WOMEN; AND
MRS. WESTON MUST NOT SPEAK OF IT AGAIN. SHE THEN TOOK ANOTHER LINE OF
EXPEDIENCY, AND LOOKING INTO THE DOUBTFUL ROOM, OBSERVED,

"I DO NOT THINK IT IS SO VERY SMALL. WE SHALL NOT BE MANY, YOU KNOW."

AND MR. WESTON AT THE SAME TIME, WALKING BRISKLY WITH LONG STEPS THROUGH
THE PASSAGE, WAS CALLING OUT,

"YOU TALK A GREAT DEAL OF THE LENGTH OF THIS PASSAGE, MY DEAR. IT IS A
MERE NOTHING AFTER ALL; AND NOT THE LEAST DRAUGHT FROM THE STAIRS."

"I WISH," SAID MRS. WESTON, "ONE COULD KNOW WHICH ARRANGEMENT OUR GUESTS
IN GENERAL WOULD LIKE BEST. TO DO WHAT WOULD BE MOST GENERALLY PLEASING
MUST BE OUR OBJECT--IF ONE COULD BUT TELL WHAT THAT WOULD BE."

"YES, VERY TRUE," CRIED FRANK, "VERY TRUE. YOU WANT YOUR NEIGHBOURS'
OPINIONS. I DO NOT WONDER AT YOU. IF ONE COULD ASCERTAIN WHAT THE CHIEF
OF THEM--THE COLES, FOR INSTANCE. THEY ARE NOT FAR OFF. SHALL I CALL
UPON THEM? OR MISS BATES? SHE IS STILL NEARER.--AND I DO NOT KNOW
WHETHER MISS BATES IS NOT AS LIKELY TO UNDERSTAND THE INCLINATIONS OF
THE REST OF THE PEOPLE AS ANY BODY. I THINK WE DO WANT A LARGER COUNCIL.
SUPPOSE I GO AND INVITE MISS BATES TO JOIN US?"

"WELL--IF YOU PLEASE," SAID MRS. WESTON RATHER HESITATING, "IF YOU THINK
SHE WILL BE OF ANY USE."

"YOU WILL GET NOTHING TO THE PURPOSE FROM MISS BATES," SAID EMMA. "SHE
WILL BE ALL DELIGHT AND GRATITUDE, BUT SHE WILL TELL YOU NOTHING. SHE
WILL NOT EVEN LISTEN TO YOUR QUESTIONS. I SEE NO ADVANTAGE IN CONSULTING
MISS BATES."

"BUT SHE IS SO AMUSING, SO EXTREMELY AMUSING! I AM VERY FOND OF HEARING
MISS BATES TALK. AND I NEED NOT BRING THE WHOLE FAMILY, YOU KNOW."

HERE MR. WESTON JOINED THEM, AND ON HEARING WHAT WAS PROPOSED, GAVE IT
HIS DECIDED APPROBATION.

"AYE, DO, FRANK.--GO AND FETCH MISS BATES, AND LET US END THE MATTER AT
ONCE. SHE WILL ENJOY THE SCHEME, I AM SURE; AND I DO NOT KNOW A PROPERER
PERSON FOR SHEWING US HOW TO DO AWAY DIFFICULTIES. FETCH MISS BATES.
WE ARE GROWING A LITTLE TOO NICE. SHE IS A STANDING LESSON OF HOW TO BE
HAPPY. BUT FETCH THEM BOTH. INVITE THEM BOTH."

"BOTH SIR! CAN THE OLD LADY?"...

"THE OLD LADY! NO, THE YOUNG LADY, TO BE SURE. I SHALL THINK YOU A GREAT
BLOCKHEAD, FRANK, IF YOU BRING THE AUNT WITHOUT THE NIECE."

"OH! I BEG YOUR PARDON, SIR. I DID NOT IMMEDIATELY RECOLLECT.
UNDOUBTEDLY IF YOU WISH IT, I WILL ENDEAVOUR TO PERSUADE THEM BOTH." AND
AWAY HE RAN.

LONG BEFORE HE REAPPEARED, ATTENDING THE SHORT, NEAT, BRISK-MOVING AUNT,
AND HER ELEGANT NIECE,--MRS. WESTON, LIKE A SWEET-TEMPERED WOMAN AND
A GOOD WIFE, HAD EXAMINED THE PASSAGE AGAIN, AND FOUND THE EVILS OF IT
MUCH LESS THAN SHE HAD SUPPOSED BEFORE--INDEED VERY TRIFLING; AND HERE
ENDED THE DIFFICULTIES OF DECISION. ALL THE REST, IN SPECULATION AT
LEAST, WAS PERFECTLY SMOOTH. ALL THE MINOR ARRANGEMENTS OF TABLE AND
CHAIR, LIGHTS AND MUSIC, TEA AND SUPPER, MADE THEMSELVES; OR WERE LEFT
AS MERE TRIFLES TO BE SETTLED AT ANY TIME BETWEEN MRS. WESTON AND MRS.
STOKES.--EVERY BODY INVITED, WAS CERTAINLY TO COME; FRANK HAD ALREADY
WRITTEN TO ENSCOMBE TO PROPOSE STAYING A FEW DAYS BEYOND HIS FORTNIGHT,
WHICH COULD NOT POSSIBLY BE REFUSED. AND A DELIGHTFUL DANCE IT WAS TO
BE.

MOST CORDIALLY, WHEN MISS BATES ARRIVED, DID SHE AGREE THAT IT MUST.
AS A COUNSELLOR SHE WAS NOT WANTED; BUT AS AN APPROVER, (A MUCH SAFER
CHARACTER,) SHE WAS TRULY WELCOME. HER APPROBATION, AT ONCE GENERAL
AND MINUTE, WARM AND INCESSANT, COULD NOT BUT PLEASE; AND FOR ANOTHER
HALF-HOUR THEY WERE ALL WALKING TO AND FRO, BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT ROOMS,
SOME SUGGESTING, SOME ATTENDING, AND ALL IN HAPPY ENJOYMENT OF THE
FUTURE. THE PARTY DID NOT BREAK UP WITHOUT EMMA'S BEING POSITIVELY
SECURED FOR THE TWO FIRST DANCES BY THE HERO OF THE EVENING, NOR WITHOUT
HER OVERHEARING MR. WESTON WHISPER TO HIS WIFE, "HE HAS ASKED HER, MY
DEAR. THAT'S RIGHT. I KNEW HE WOULD!"



CHAPTER XII


ONE THING ONLY WAS WANTING TO MAKE THE PROSPECT OF THE BALL COMPLETELY
SATISFACTORY TO EMMA--ITS BEING FIXED FOR A DAY WITHIN THE GRANTED
TERM OF FRANK CHURCHILL'S STAY IN SURRY; FOR, IN SPITE OF MR. WESTON'S
CONFIDENCE, SHE COULD NOT THINK IT SO VERY IMPOSSIBLE THAT THE
CHURCHILLS MIGHT NOT ALLOW THEIR NEPHEW TO REMAIN A DAY BEYOND HIS
FORTNIGHT. BUT THIS WAS NOT JUDGED FEASIBLE. THE PREPARATIONS MUST TAKE
THEIR TIME, NOTHING COULD BE PROPERLY READY TILL THE THIRD WEEK WERE
ENTERED ON, AND FOR A FEW DAYS THEY MUST BE PLANNING, PROCEEDING AND
HOPING IN UNCERTAINTY--AT THE RISK--IN HER OPINION, THE GREAT RISK, OF
ITS BEING ALL IN VAIN.

ENSCOMBE HOWEVER WAS GRACIOUS, GRACIOUS IN FACT, IF NOT IN WORD. HIS
WISH OF STAYING LONGER EVIDENTLY DID NOT PLEASE; BUT IT WAS NOT OPPOSED.
ALL WAS SAFE AND PROSPEROUS; AND AS THE REMOVAL OF ONE SOLICITUDE
GENERALLY MAKES WAY FOR ANOTHER, EMMA, BEING NOW CERTAIN OF HER
BALL, BEGAN TO ADOPT AS THE NEXT VEXATION MR. KNIGHTLEY'S PROVOKING
INDIFFERENCE ABOUT IT. EITHER BECAUSE HE DID NOT DANCE HIMSELF, OR
BECAUSE THE PLAN HAD BEEN FORMED WITHOUT HIS BEING CONSULTED, HE
SEEMED RESOLVED THAT IT SHOULD NOT INTEREST HIM, DETERMINED AGAINST ITS
EXCITING ANY PRESENT CURIOSITY, OR AFFORDING HIM ANY FUTURE AMUSEMENT.
TO HER VOLUNTARY COMMUNICATIONS EMMA COULD GET NO MORE APPROVING REPLY,
THAN,

"VERY WELL. IF THE WESTONS THINK IT WORTH WHILE TO BE AT ALL THIS
TROUBLE FOR A FEW HOURS OF NOISY ENTERTAINMENT, I HAVE NOTHING TO SAY
AGAINST IT, BUT THAT THEY SHALL NOT CHUSE PLEASURES FOR ME.--OH! YES,
I MUST BE THERE; I COULD NOT REFUSE; AND I WILL KEEP AS MUCH AWAKE AS
I CAN; BUT I WOULD RATHER BE AT HOME, LOOKING OVER WILLIAM LARKINS'S
WEEK'S ACCOUNT; MUCH RATHER, I CONFESS.--PLEASURE IN SEEING
DANCING!--NOT I, INDEED--I NEVER LOOK AT IT--I DO NOT KNOW WHO
DOES.--FINE DANCING, I BELIEVE, LIKE VIRTUE, MUST BE ITS OWN REWARD.
THOSE WHO ARE STANDING BY ARE USUALLY THINKING OF SOMETHING VERY
DIFFERENT."

THIS EMMA FELT WAS AIMED AT HER; AND IT MADE HER QUITE ANGRY. IT WAS NOT
IN COMPLIMENT TO JANE FAIRFAX HOWEVER THAT HE WAS SO INDIFFERENT, OR SO
INDIGNANT; HE WAS NOT GUIDED BY HER FEELINGS IN REPROBATING THE BALL,
FOR SHE ENJOYED THE THOUGHT OF IT TO AN EXTRAORDINARY DEGREE. IT MADE
HER ANIMATED--OPEN HEARTED--SHE VOLUNTARILY SAID;--

"OH! MISS WOODHOUSE, I HOPE NOTHING MAY HAPPEN TO PREVENT THE BALL.
WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT IT WOULD BE! I DO LOOK FORWARD TO IT, I OWN, WITH
VERY GREAT PLEASURE."

IT WAS NOT TO OBLIGE JANE FAIRFAX THEREFORE THAT HE WOULD HAVE PREFERRED
THE SOCIETY OF WILLIAM LARKINS. NO!--SHE WAS MORE AND MORE CONVINCED
THAT MRS. WESTON WAS QUITE MISTAKEN IN THAT SURMISE. THERE WAS A GREAT
DEAL OF FRIENDLY AND OF COMPASSIONATE ATTACHMENT ON HIS SIDE--BUT NO
LOVE.

ALAS! THERE WAS SOON NO LEISURE FOR QUARRELLING WITH MR. KNIGHTLEY. TWO
DAYS OF JOYFUL SECURITY WERE IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED BY THE OVER-THROW OF
EVERY THING. A LETTER ARRIVED FROM MR. CHURCHILL TO URGE HIS NEPHEW'S
INSTANT RETURN. MRS. CHURCHILL WAS UNWELL--FAR TOO UNWELL TO DO WITHOUT
HIM; SHE HAD BEEN IN A VERY SUFFERING STATE (SO SAID HER HUSBAND)
WHEN WRITING TO HER NEPHEW TWO DAYS BEFORE, THOUGH FROM HER USUAL
UNWILLINGNESS TO GIVE PAIN, AND CONSTANT HABIT OF NEVER THINKING OF
HERSELF, SHE HAD NOT MENTIONED IT; BUT NOW SHE WAS TOO ILL TO TRIFLE,
AND MUST ENTREAT HIM TO SET OFF FOR ENSCOMBE WITHOUT DELAY.

THE SUBSTANCE OF THIS LETTER WAS FORWARDED TO EMMA, IN A NOTE FROM MRS.
WESTON, INSTANTLY. AS TO HIS GOING, IT WAS INEVITABLE. HE MUST BE GONE
WITHIN A FEW HOURS, THOUGH WITHOUT FEELING ANY REAL ALARM FOR HIS AUNT,
TO LESSEN HIS REPUGNANCE. HE KNEW HER ILLNESSES; THEY NEVER OCCURRED BUT
FOR HER OWN CONVENIENCE.

MRS. WESTON ADDED, "THAT HE COULD ONLY ALLOW HIMSELF TIME TO HURRY TO
HIGHBURY, AFTER BREAKFAST, AND TAKE LEAVE OF THE FEW FRIENDS THERE
WHOM HE COULD SUPPOSE TO FEEL ANY INTEREST IN HIM; AND THAT HE MIGHT BE
EXPECTED AT HARTFIELD VERY SOON."

THIS WRETCHED NOTE WAS THE FINALE OF EMMA'S BREAKFAST. WHEN ONCE IT HAD
BEEN READ, THERE WAS NO DOING ANY THING, BUT LAMENT AND EXCLAIM. THE
LOSS OF THE BALL--THE LOSS OF THE YOUNG MAN--AND ALL THAT THE YOUNG MAN
MIGHT BE FEELING!--IT WAS TOO WRETCHED!--SUCH A DELIGHTFUL EVENING AS
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN!--EVERY BODY SO HAPPY! AND SHE AND HER PARTNER THE
HAPPIEST!--"I SAID IT WOULD BE SO," WAS THE ONLY CONSOLATION.

HER FATHER'S FEELINGS WERE QUITE DISTINCT. HE THOUGHT PRINCIPALLY OF
MRS. CHURCHILL'S ILLNESS, AND WANTED TO KNOW HOW SHE WAS TREATED; AND AS
FOR THE BALL, IT WAS SHOCKING TO HAVE DEAR EMMA DISAPPOINTED; BUT THEY
WOULD ALL BE SAFER AT HOME.

EMMA WAS READY FOR HER VISITOR SOME TIME BEFORE HE APPEARED; BUT IF THIS
REFLECTED AT ALL UPON HIS IMPATIENCE, HIS SORROWFUL LOOK AND TOTAL WANT
OF SPIRITS WHEN HE DID COME MIGHT REDEEM HIM. HE FELT THE GOING AWAY
ALMOST TOO MUCH TO SPEAK OF IT. HIS DEJECTION WAS MOST EVIDENT. HE
SAT REALLY LOST IN THOUGHT FOR THE FIRST FEW MINUTES; AND WHEN ROUSING
HIMSELF, IT WAS ONLY TO SAY,

"OF ALL HORRID THINGS, LEAVE-TAKING IS THE WORST."

"BUT YOU WILL COME AGAIN," SAID EMMA. "THIS WILL NOT BE YOUR ONLY VISIT
TO RANDALLS."

"AH!--(SHAKING HIS HEAD)--THE UNCERTAINTY OF WHEN I MAY BE ABLE TO
RETURN!--I SHALL TRY FOR IT WITH A ZEAL!--IT WILL BE THE OBJECT OF
ALL MY THOUGHTS AND CARES!--AND IF MY UNCLE AND AUNT GO TO TOWN THIS
SPRING--BUT I AM AFRAID--THEY DID NOT STIR LAST SPRING--I AM AFRAID IT
IS A CUSTOM GONE FOR EVER."

"OUR POOR BALL MUST BE QUITE GIVEN UP."

"AH! THAT BALL!--WHY DID WE WAIT FOR ANY THING?--WHY NOT SEIZE THE
PLEASURE AT ONCE?--HOW OFTEN IS HAPPINESS DESTROYED BY PREPARATION,
FOOLISH PREPARATION!--YOU TOLD US IT WOULD BE SO.--OH! MISS WOODHOUSE,
WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS SO RIGHT?"

"INDEED, I AM VERY SORRY TO BE RIGHT IN THIS INSTANCE. I WOULD MUCH
RATHER HAVE BEEN MERRY THAN WISE."

"IF I CAN COME AGAIN, WE ARE STILL TO HAVE OUR BALL. MY FATHER DEPENDS
ON IT. DO NOT FORGET YOUR ENGAGEMENT."

EMMA LOOKED GRACIOUSLY.

"SUCH A FORTNIGHT AS IT HAS BEEN!" HE CONTINUED; "EVERY DAY MORE
PRECIOUS AND MORE DELIGHTFUL THAN THE DAY BEFORE!--EVERY DAY MAKING
ME LESS FIT TO BEAR ANY OTHER PLACE. HAPPY THOSE, WHO CAN REMAIN AT
HIGHBURY!"

"AS YOU DO US SUCH AMPLE JUSTICE NOW," SAID EMMA, LAUGHING, "I WILL
VENTURE TO ASK, WHETHER YOU DID NOT COME A LITTLE DOUBTFULLY AT FIRST?
DO NOT WE RATHER SURPASS YOUR EXPECTATIONS? I AM SURE WE DO. I AM SURE
YOU DID NOT MUCH EXPECT TO LIKE US. YOU WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SO LONG IN
COMING, IF YOU HAD HAD A PLEASANT IDEA OF HIGHBURY."

HE LAUGHED RATHER CONSCIOUSLY; AND THOUGH DENYING THE SENTIMENT, EMMA
WAS CONVINCED THAT IT HAD BEEN SO.

"AND YOU MUST BE OFF THIS VERY MORNING?"

"YES; MY FATHER IS TO JOIN ME HERE: WE SHALL WALK BACK TOGETHER, AND I
MUST BE OFF IMMEDIATELY. I AM ALMOST AFRAID THAT EVERY MOMENT WILL BRING
HIM."

"NOT FIVE MINUTES TO SPARE EVEN FOR YOUR FRIENDS MISS FAIRFAX AND MISS
BATES? HOW UNLUCKY! MISS BATES'S POWERFUL, ARGUMENTATIVE MIND MIGHT HAVE
STRENGTHENED YOURS."

"YES--I HAVE CALLED THERE; PASSING THE DOOR, I THOUGHT IT BETTER. IT
WAS A RIGHT THING TO DO. I WENT IN FOR THREE MINUTES, AND WAS DETAINED
BY MISS BATES'S BEING ABSENT. SHE WAS OUT; AND I FELT IT IMPOSSIBLE NOT
TO WAIT TILL SHE CAME IN. SHE IS A WOMAN THAT ONE MAY, THAT ONE MUST
LAUGH AT; BUT THAT ONE WOULD NOT WISH TO SLIGHT. IT WAS BETTER TO PAY MY
VISIT, THEN"--

HE HESITATED, GOT UP, WALKED TO A WINDOW.

"IN SHORT," SAID HE, "PERHAPS, MISS WOODHOUSE--I THINK YOU CAN HARDLY BE
QUITE WITHOUT SUSPICION"--

HE LOOKED AT HER, AS IF WANTING TO READ HER THOUGHTS. SHE HARDLY KNEW
WHAT TO SAY. IT SEEMED LIKE THE FORERUNNER OF SOMETHING ABSOLUTELY
SERIOUS, WHICH SHE DID NOT WISH. FORCING HERSELF TO SPEAK, THEREFORE, IN
THE HOPE OF PUTTING IT BY, SHE CALMLY SAID,

"YOU ARE QUITE IN THE RIGHT; IT WAS MOST NATURAL TO PAY YOUR VISIT,
THEN"--

HE WAS SILENT. SHE BELIEVED HE WAS LOOKING AT HER; PROBABLY REFLECTING
ON WHAT SHE HAD SAID, AND TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE MANNER. SHE HEARD
HIM SIGH. IT WAS NATURAL FOR HIM TO FEEL THAT HE HAD CAUSE TO SIGH.
HE COULD NOT BELIEVE HER TO BE ENCOURAGING HIM. A FEW AWKWARD MOMENTS
PASSED, AND HE SAT DOWN AGAIN; AND IN A MORE DETERMINED MANNER SAID,

"IT WAS SOMETHING TO FEEL THAT ALL THE REST OF MY TIME MIGHT BE GIVEN TO
HARTFIELD. MY REGARD FOR HARTFIELD IS MOST WARM"--

HE STOPT AGAIN, ROSE AGAIN, AND SEEMED QUITE EMBARRASSED.--HE WAS MORE
IN LOVE WITH HER THAN EMMA HAD SUPPOSED; AND WHO CAN SAY HOW IT MIGHT
HAVE ENDED, IF HIS FATHER HAD NOT MADE HIS APPEARANCE? MR. WOODHOUSE
SOON FOLLOWED; AND THE NECESSITY OF EXERTION MADE HIM COMPOSED.

A VERY FEW MINUTES MORE, HOWEVER, COMPLETED THE PRESENT TRIAL. MR.
WESTON, ALWAYS ALERT WHEN BUSINESS WAS TO BE DONE, AND AS INCAPABLE OF
PROCRASTINATING ANY EVIL THAT WAS INEVITABLE, AS OF FORESEEING ANY THAT
WAS DOUBTFUL, SAID, "IT WAS TIME TO GO;" AND THE YOUNG MAN, THOUGH HE
MIGHT AND DID SIGH, COULD NOT BUT AGREE, TO TAKE LEAVE.

"I SHALL HEAR ABOUT YOU ALL," SAID HE; "THAT IS MY CHIEF CONSOLATION.
I SHALL HEAR OF EVERY THING THAT IS GOING ON AMONG YOU. I HAVE ENGAGED
MRS. WESTON TO CORRESPOND WITH ME. SHE HAS BEEN SO KIND AS TO PROMISE
IT. OH! THE BLESSING OF A FEMALE CORRESPONDENT, WHEN ONE IS REALLY
INTERESTED IN THE ABSENT!--SHE WILL TELL ME EVERY THING. IN HER LETTERS
I SHALL BE AT DEAR HIGHBURY AGAIN."

A VERY FRIENDLY SHAKE OF THE HAND, A VERY EARNEST "GOOD-BYE," CLOSED THE
SPEECH, AND THE DOOR HAD SOON SHUT OUT FRANK CHURCHILL. SHORT HAD BEEN
THE NOTICE--SHORT THEIR MEETING; HE WAS GONE; AND EMMA FELT SO SORRY
TO PART, AND FORESAW SO GREAT A LOSS TO THEIR LITTLE SOCIETY FROM HIS
ABSENCE AS TO BEGIN TO BE AFRAID OF BEING TOO SORRY, AND FEELING IT TOO
MUCH.

IT WAS A SAD CHANGE. THEY HAD BEEN MEETING ALMOST EVERY DAY SINCE HIS
ARRIVAL. CERTAINLY HIS BEING AT RANDALLS HAD GIVEN GREAT SPIRIT TO
THE LAST TWO WEEKS--INDESCRIBABLE SPIRIT; THE IDEA, THE EXPECTATION
OF SEEING HIM WHICH EVERY MORNING HAD BROUGHT, THE ASSURANCE OF HIS
ATTENTIONS, HIS LIVELINESS, HIS MANNERS! IT HAD BEEN A VERY HAPPY
FORTNIGHT, AND FORLORN MUST BE THE SINKING FROM IT INTO THE COMMON
COURSE OF HARTFIELD DAYS. TO COMPLETE EVERY OTHER RECOMMENDATION, HE HAD
ALMOST TOLD HER THAT HE LOVED HER. WHAT STRENGTH, OR WHAT CONSTANCY OF
AFFECTION HE MIGHT BE SUBJECT TO, WAS ANOTHER POINT; BUT AT PRESENT
SHE COULD NOT DOUBT HIS HAVING A DECIDEDLY WARM ADMIRATION, A CONSCIOUS
PREFERENCE OF HERSELF; AND THIS PERSUASION, JOINED TO ALL THE REST,
MADE HER THINK THAT SHE MUST BE A LITTLE IN LOVE WITH HIM, IN SPITE OF
EVERY PREVIOUS DETERMINATION AGAINST IT.

"I CERTAINLY MUST," SAID SHE. "THIS SENSATION OF LISTLESSNESS,
WEARINESS, STUPIDITY, THIS DISINCLINATION TO SIT DOWN AND EMPLOY MYSELF,
THIS FEELING OF EVERY THING'S BEING DULL AND INSIPID ABOUT THE HOUSE!--
I MUST BE IN LOVE; I SHOULD BE THE ODDEST CREATURE IN THE WORLD IF I
WERE NOT--FOR A FEW WEEKS AT LEAST. WELL! EVIL TO SOME IS ALWAYS GOOD TO
OTHERS. I SHALL HAVE MANY FELLOW-MOURNERS FOR THE BALL, IF NOT FOR FRANK
CHURCHILL; BUT MR. KNIGHTLEY WILL BE HAPPY. HE MAY SPEND THE EVENING
WITH HIS DEAR WILLIAM LARKINS NOW IF HE LIKES."

MR. KNIGHTLEY, HOWEVER, SHEWED NO TRIUMPHANT HAPPINESS. HE COULD NOT SAY
THAT HE WAS SORRY ON HIS OWN ACCOUNT; HIS VERY CHEERFUL LOOK WOULD HAVE
CONTRADICTED HIM IF HE HAD; BUT HE SAID, AND VERY STEADILY, THAT HE
WAS SORRY FOR THE DISAPPOINTMENT OF THE OTHERS, AND WITH CONSIDERABLE
KINDNESS ADDED,

"YOU, EMMA, WHO HAVE SO FEW OPPORTUNITIES OF DANCING, YOU ARE REALLY OUT
OF LUCK; YOU ARE VERY MUCH OUT OF LUCK!"

IT WAS SOME DAYS BEFORE SHE SAW JANE FAIRFAX, TO JUDGE OF HER HONEST
REGRET IN THIS WOEFUL CHANGE; BUT WHEN THEY DID MEET, HER COMPOSURE
WAS ODIOUS. SHE HAD BEEN PARTICULARLY UNWELL, HOWEVER, SUFFERING FROM
HEADACHE TO A DEGREE, WHICH MADE HER AUNT DECLARE, THAT HAD THE BALL
TAKEN PLACE, SHE DID NOT THINK JANE COULD HAVE ATTENDED IT; AND IT WAS
CHARITY TO IMPUTE SOME OF HER UNBECOMING INDIFFERENCE TO THE LANGUOR OF
ILL-HEALTH.



CHAPTER XIII


EMMA CONTINUED TO ENTERTAIN NO DOUBT OF HER BEING IN LOVE. HER IDEAS
ONLY VARIED AS TO THE HOW MUCH. AT FIRST, SHE THOUGHT IT WAS A GOOD
DEAL; AND AFTERWARDS, BUT LITTLE. SHE HAD GREAT PLEASURE IN HEARING
FRANK CHURCHILL TALKED OF; AND, FOR HIS SAKE, GREATER PLEASURE THAN EVER
IN SEEING MR. AND MRS. WESTON; SHE WAS VERY OFTEN THINKING OF HIM, AND
QUITE IMPATIENT FOR A LETTER, THAT SHE MIGHT KNOW HOW HE WAS, HOW WERE
HIS SPIRITS, HOW WAS HIS AUNT, AND WHAT WAS THE CHANCE OF HIS COMING TO
RANDALLS AGAIN THIS SPRING. BUT, ON THE OTHER HAND, SHE COULD NOT ADMIT
HERSELF TO BE UNHAPPY, NOR, AFTER THE FIRST MORNING, TO BE LESS DISPOSED
FOR EMPLOYMENT THAN USUAL; SHE WAS STILL BUSY AND CHEERFUL; AND,
PLEASING AS HE WAS, SHE COULD YET IMAGINE HIM TO HAVE FAULTS; AND
FARTHER, THOUGH THINKING OF HIM SO MUCH, AND, AS SHE SAT DRAWING OR
WORKING, FORMING A THOUSAND AMUSING SCHEMES FOR THE PROGRESS AND CLOSE
OF THEIR ATTACHMENT, FANCYING INTERESTING DIALOGUES, AND INVENTING
ELEGANT LETTERS; THE CONCLUSION OF EVERY IMAGINARY DECLARATION ON HIS
SIDE WAS THAT SHE REFUSED HIM. THEIR AFFECTION WAS ALWAYS TO SUBSIDE
INTO FRIENDSHIP. EVERY THING TENDER AND CHARMING WAS TO MARK THEIR
PARTING; BUT STILL THEY WERE TO PART. WHEN SHE BECAME SENSIBLE OF THIS,
IT STRUCK HER THAT SHE COULD NOT BE VERY MUCH IN LOVE; FOR IN SPITE OF
HER PREVIOUS AND FIXED DETERMINATION NEVER TO QUIT HER FATHER, NEVER
TO MARRY, A STRONG ATTACHMENT CERTAINLY MUST PRODUCE MORE OF A STRUGGLE
THAN SHE COULD FORESEE IN HER OWN FEELINGS.

"I DO NOT FIND MYSELF MAKING ANY USE OF THE WORD SACRIFICE," SAID
SHE.--"IN NOT ONE OF ALL MY CLEVER REPLIES, MY DELICATE NEGATIVES, IS
THERE ANY ALLUSION TO MAKING A SACRIFICE. I DO SUSPECT THAT HE IS NOT
REALLY NECESSARY TO MY HAPPINESS. SO MUCH THE BETTER. I CERTAINLY WILL
NOT PERSUADE MYSELF TO FEEL MORE THAN I DO. I AM QUITE ENOUGH IN LOVE. I
SHOULD BE SORRY TO BE MORE."

UPON THE WHOLE, SHE WAS EQUALLY CONTENTED WITH HER VIEW OF HIS FEELINGS.

"HE IS UNDOUBTEDLY VERY MUCH IN LOVE--EVERY THING DENOTES IT--VERY
MUCH IN LOVE INDEED!--AND WHEN HE COMES AGAIN, IF HIS AFFECTION
CONTINUE, I MUST BE ON MY GUARD NOT TO ENCOURAGE IT.--IT WOULD BE MOST
INEXCUSABLE TO DO OTHERWISE, AS MY OWN MIND IS QUITE MADE UP. NOT THAT I
IMAGINE HE CAN THINK I HAVE BEEN ENCOURAGING HIM HITHERTO. NO, IF HE
HAD BELIEVED ME AT ALL TO SHARE HIS FEELINGS, HE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN
SO WRETCHED. COULD HE HAVE THOUGHT HIMSELF ENCOURAGED, HIS LOOKS AND
LANGUAGE AT PARTING WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT.--STILL, HOWEVER, I MUST
BE ON MY GUARD. THIS IS IN THE SUPPOSITION OF HIS ATTACHMENT CONTINUING
WHAT IT NOW IS; BUT I DO NOT KNOW THAT I EXPECT IT WILL; I DO NOT LOOK
UPON HIM TO BE QUITE THE SORT OF MAN--I DO NOT ALTOGETHER BUILD UPON
HIS STEADINESS OR CONSTANCY.--HIS FEELINGS ARE WARM, BUT I CAN IMAGINE
THEM RATHER CHANGEABLE.--EVERY CONSIDERATION OF THE SUBJECT, IN SHORT,
MAKES ME THANKFUL THAT MY HAPPINESS IS NOT MORE DEEPLY INVOLVED.--I
SHALL DO VERY WELL AGAIN AFTER A LITTLE WHILE--AND THEN, IT WILL BE A
GOOD THING OVER; FOR THEY SAY EVERY BODY IS IN LOVE ONCE IN THEIR LIVES,
AND I SHALL HAVE BEEN LET OFF EASILY."

WHEN HIS LETTER TO MRS. WESTON ARRIVED, EMMA HAD THE PERUSAL OF IT; AND
SHE READ IT WITH A DEGREE OF PLEASURE AND ADMIRATION WHICH MADE HER
AT FIRST SHAKE HER HEAD OVER HER OWN SENSATIONS, AND THINK SHE HAD
UNDERVALUED THEIR STRENGTH. IT WAS A LONG, WELL-WRITTEN LETTER, GIVING
THE PARTICULARS OF HIS JOURNEY AND OF HIS FEELINGS, EXPRESSING ALL THE
AFFECTION, GRATITUDE, AND RESPECT WHICH WAS NATURAL AND HONOURABLE,
AND DESCRIBING EVERY THING EXTERIOR AND LOCAL THAT COULD BE SUPPOSED
ATTRACTIVE, WITH SPIRIT AND PRECISION. NO SUSPICIOUS FLOURISHES NOW OF
APOLOGY OR CONCERN; IT WAS THE LANGUAGE OF REAL FEELING TOWARDS MRS.
WESTON; AND THE TRANSITION FROM HIGHBURY TO ENSCOMBE, THE CONTRAST
BETWEEN THE PLACES IN SOME OF THE FIRST BLESSINGS OF SOCIAL LIFE WAS
JUST ENOUGH TOUCHED ON TO SHEW HOW KEENLY IT WAS FELT, AND HOW MUCH MORE
MIGHT HAVE BEEN SAID BUT FOR THE RESTRAINTS OF PROPRIETY.--THE CHARM
OF HER OWN NAME WAS NOT WANTING. MISS WOODHOUSE APPEARED MORE THAN
ONCE, AND NEVER WITHOUT A SOMETHING OF PLEASING CONNEXION, EITHER A
COMPLIMENT TO HER TASTE, OR A REMEMBRANCE OF WHAT SHE HAD SAID; AND IN
THE VERY LAST TIME OF ITS MEETING HER EYE, UNADORNED AS IT WAS BY ANY
SUCH BROAD WREATH OF GALLANTRY, SHE YET COULD DISCERN THE EFFECT OF
HER INFLUENCE AND ACKNOWLEDGE THE GREATEST COMPLIMENT PERHAPS OF ALL
CONVEYED. COMPRESSED INTO THE VERY LOWEST VACANT CORNER WERE THESE
WORDS--"I HAD NOT A SPARE MOMENT ON TUESDAY, AS YOU KNOW, FOR MISS
WOODHOUSE'S BEAUTIFUL LITTLE FRIEND. PRAY MAKE MY EXCUSES AND ADIEUS
TO HER." THIS, EMMA COULD NOT DOUBT, WAS ALL FOR HERSELF. HARRIET WAS
REMEMBERED ONLY FROM BEING HER FRIEND. HIS INFORMATION AND PROSPECTS
AS TO ENSCOMBE WERE NEITHER WORSE NOR BETTER THAN HAD BEEN ANTICIPATED;
MRS. CHURCHILL WAS RECOVERING, AND HE DARED NOT YET, EVEN IN HIS OWN
IMAGINATION, FIX A TIME FOR COMING TO RANDALLS AGAIN.

GRATIFYING, HOWEVER, AND STIMULATIVE AS WAS THE LETTER IN THE MATERIAL
PART, ITS SENTIMENTS, SHE YET FOUND, WHEN IT WAS FOLDED UP AND RETURNED
TO MRS. WESTON, THAT IT HAD NOT ADDED ANY LASTING WARMTH, THAT SHE COULD
STILL DO WITHOUT THE WRITER, AND THAT HE MUST LEARN TO DO WITHOUT HER.
HER INTENTIONS WERE UNCHANGED. HER RESOLUTION OF REFUSAL ONLY GREW MORE
INTERESTING BY THE ADDITION OF A SCHEME FOR HIS SUBSEQUENT CONSOLATION
AND HAPPINESS. HIS RECOLLECTION OF HARRIET, AND THE WORDS WHICH
CLOTHED IT, THE "BEAUTIFUL LITTLE FRIEND," SUGGESTED TO HER THE
IDEA OF HARRIET'S SUCCEEDING HER IN HIS AFFECTIONS. WAS IT
IMPOSSIBLE?--NO.--HARRIET UNDOUBTEDLY WAS GREATLY HIS INFERIOR IN
UNDERSTANDING; BUT HE HAD BEEN VERY MUCH STRUCK WITH THE LOVELINESS
OF HER FACE AND THE WARM SIMPLICITY OF HER MANNER; AND ALL THE
PROBABILITIES OF CIRCUMSTANCE AND CONNEXION WERE IN HER FAVOUR.--FOR
HARRIET, IT WOULD BE ADVANTAGEOUS AND DELIGHTFUL INDEED.

"I MUST NOT DWELL UPON IT," SAID SHE.--"I MUST NOT THINK OF IT. I KNOW
THE DANGER OF INDULGING SUCH SPECULATIONS. BUT STRANGER THINGS HAVE
HAPPENED; AND WHEN WE CEASE TO CARE FOR EACH OTHER AS WE DO NOW, IT
WILL BE THE MEANS OF CONFIRMING US IN THAT SORT OF TRUE DISINTERESTED
FRIENDSHIP WHICH I CAN ALREADY LOOK FORWARD TO WITH PLEASURE."

IT WAS WELL TO HAVE A COMFORT IN STORE ON HARRIET'S BEHALF, THOUGH IT
MIGHT BE WISE TO LET THE FANCY TOUCH IT SELDOM; FOR EVIL IN THAT QUARTER
WAS AT HAND. AS FRANK CHURCHILL'S ARRIVAL HAD SUCCEEDED MR. ELTON'S
ENGAGEMENT IN THE CONVERSATION OF HIGHBURY, AS THE LATEST INTEREST
HAD ENTIRELY BORNE DOWN THE FIRST, SO NOW UPON FRANK CHURCHILL'S
DISAPPEARANCE, MR. ELTON'S CONCERNS WERE ASSUMING THE MOST IRRESISTIBLE
FORM.--HIS WEDDING-DAY WAS NAMED. HE WOULD SOON BE AMONG THEM AGAIN; MR.
ELTON AND HIS BRIDE. THERE WAS HARDLY TIME TO TALK OVER THE FIRST LETTER
FROM ENSCOMBE BEFORE "MR. ELTON AND HIS BRIDE" WAS IN EVERY BODY'S
MOUTH, AND FRANK CHURCHILL WAS FORGOTTEN. EMMA GREW SICK AT THE SOUND.
SHE HAD HAD THREE WEEKS OF HAPPY EXEMPTION FROM MR. ELTON; AND HARRIET'S
MIND, SHE HAD BEEN WILLING TO HOPE, HAD BEEN LATELY GAINING STRENGTH.
WITH MR. WESTON'S BALL IN VIEW AT LEAST, THERE HAD BEEN A GREAT DEAL OF
INSENSIBILITY TO OTHER THINGS; BUT IT WAS NOW TOO EVIDENT THAT SHE HAD
NOT ATTAINED SUCH A STATE OF COMPOSURE AS COULD STAND AGAINST THE ACTUAL
APPROACH--NEW CARRIAGE, BELL-RINGING, AND ALL.

POOR HARRIET WAS IN A FLUTTER OF SPIRITS WHICH REQUIRED ALL THE
REASONINGS AND SOOTHINGS AND ATTENTIONS OF EVERY KIND THAT EMMA COULD
GIVE. EMMA FELT THAT SHE COULD NOT DO TOO MUCH FOR HER, THAT HARRIET HAD
A RIGHT TO ALL HER INGENUITY AND ALL HER PATIENCE; BUT IT WAS HEAVY WORK
TO BE FOR EVER CONVINCING WITHOUT PRODUCING ANY EFFECT, FOR EVER AGREED
TO, WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO MAKE THEIR OPINIONS THE SAME. HARRIET LISTENED
SUBMISSIVELY, AND SAID "IT WAS VERY TRUE--IT WAS JUST AS MISS WOODHOUSE
DESCRIBED--IT WAS NOT WORTH WHILE TO THINK ABOUT THEM--AND SHE WOULD NOT
THINK ABOUT THEM ANY LONGER" BUT NO CHANGE OF SUBJECT COULD AVAIL, AND
THE NEXT HALF-HOUR SAW HER AS ANXIOUS AND RESTLESS ABOUT THE ELTONS AS
BEFORE. AT LAST EMMA ATTACKED HER ON ANOTHER GROUND.

"YOUR ALLOWING YOURSELF TO BE SO OCCUPIED AND SO UNHAPPY ABOUT MR.
ELTON'S MARRYING, HARRIET, IS THE STRONGEST REPROACH YOU CAN MAKE ME.
YOU COULD NOT GIVE ME A GREATER REPROOF FOR THE MISTAKE I FELL INTO.
IT WAS ALL MY DOING, I KNOW. I HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN IT, I ASSURE
YOU.--DECEIVED MYSELF, I DID VERY MISERABLY DECEIVE YOU--AND IT WILL
BE A PAINFUL REFLECTION TO ME FOR EVER. DO NOT IMAGINE ME IN DANGER OF
FORGETTING IT."

HARRIET FELT THIS TOO MUCH TO UTTER MORE THAN A FEW WORDS OF EAGER
EXCLAMATION. EMMA CONTINUED,

"I HAVE NOT SAID, EXERT YOURSELF HARRIET FOR MY SAKE; THINK LESS, TALK
LESS OF MR. ELTON FOR MY SAKE; BECAUSE FOR YOUR OWN SAKE RATHER, I
WOULD WISH IT TO BE DONE, FOR THE SAKE OF WHAT IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN MY
COMFORT, A HABIT OF SELF-COMMAND IN YOU, A CONSIDERATION OF WHAT IS YOUR
DUTY, AN ATTENTION TO PROPRIETY, AN ENDEAVOUR TO AVOID THE SUSPICIONS OF
OTHERS, TO SAVE YOUR HEALTH AND CREDIT, AND RESTORE YOUR TRANQUILLITY.
THESE ARE THE MOTIVES WHICH I HAVE BEEN PRESSING ON YOU. THEY ARE VERY
IMPORTANT--AND SORRY I AM THAT YOU CANNOT FEEL THEM SUFFICIENTLY TO ACT
UPON THEM. MY BEING SAVED FROM PAIN IS A VERY SECONDARY CONSIDERATION.
I WANT YOU TO SAVE YOURSELF FROM GREATER PAIN. PERHAPS I MAY SOMETIMES
HAVE FELT THAT HARRIET WOULD NOT FORGET WHAT WAS DUE--OR RATHER WHAT
WOULD BE KIND BY ME."

THIS APPEAL TO HER AFFECTIONS DID MORE THAN ALL THE REST. THE IDEA OF
WANTING GRATITUDE AND CONSIDERATION FOR MISS WOODHOUSE, WHOM SHE REALLY
LOVED EXTREMELY, MADE HER WRETCHED FOR A WHILE, AND WHEN THE VIOLENCE
OF GRIEF WAS COMFORTED AWAY, STILL REMAINED POWERFUL ENOUGH TO PROMPT TO
WHAT WAS RIGHT AND SUPPORT HER IN IT VERY TOLERABLY.

"YOU, WHO HAVE BEEN THE BEST FRIEND I EVER HAD IN MY LIFE--WANT
GRATITUDE TO YOU!--NOBODY IS EQUAL TO YOU!--I CARE FOR NOBODY AS I DO
FOR YOU!--OH! MISS WOODHOUSE, HOW UNGRATEFUL I HAVE BEEN!"

SUCH EXPRESSIONS, ASSISTED AS THEY WERE BY EVERY THING THAT LOOK AND
MANNER COULD DO, MADE EMMA FEEL THAT SHE HAD NEVER LOVED HARRIET SO
WELL, NOR VALUED HER AFFECTION SO HIGHLY BEFORE.

"THERE IS NO CHARM EQUAL TO TENDERNESS OF HEART," SAID SHE AFTERWARDS TO
HERSELF. "THERE IS NOTHING TO BE COMPARED TO IT. WARMTH AND TENDERNESS
OF HEART, WITH AN AFFECTIONATE, OPEN MANNER, WILL BEAT ALL THE
CLEARNESS OF HEAD IN THE WORLD, FOR ATTRACTION, I AM SURE IT WILL. IT
IS TENDERNESS OF HEART WHICH MAKES MY DEAR FATHER SO GENERALLY
BELOVED--WHICH GIVES ISABELLA ALL HER POPULARITY.--I HAVE IT NOT--BUT
I KNOW HOW TO PRIZE AND RESPECT IT.--HARRIET IS MY SUPERIOR IN ALL THE
CHARM AND ALL THE FELICITY IT GIVES. DEAR HARRIET!--I WOULD NOT CHANGE
YOU FOR THE CLEAREST-HEADED, LONGEST-SIGHTED, BEST-JUDGING FEMALE
BREATHING. OH! THE COLDNESS OF A JANE FAIRFAX!--HARRIET IS WORTH A
HUNDRED SUCH--AND FOR A WIFE--A SENSIBLE MAN'S WIFE--IT IS INVALUABLE. I
MENTION NO NAMES; BUT HAPPY THE MAN WHO CHANGES EMMA FOR HARRIET!"



CHAPTER XIV


MRS. ELTON WAS FIRST SEEN AT CHURCH: BUT THOUGH DEVOTION MIGHT BE
INTERRUPTED, CURIOSITY COULD NOT BE SATISFIED BY A BRIDE IN A PEW, AND
IT MUST BE LEFT FOR THE VISITS IN FORM WHICH WERE THEN TO BE PAID, TO
SETTLE WHETHER SHE WERE VERY PRETTY INDEED, OR ONLY RATHER PRETTY, OR
NOT PRETTY AT ALL.

EMMA HAD FEELINGS, LESS OF CURIOSITY THAN OF PRIDE OR PROPRIETY, TO MAKE
HER RESOLVE ON NOT BEING THE LAST TO PAY HER RESPECTS; AND SHE MADE A
POINT OF HARRIET'S GOING WITH HER, THAT THE WORST OF THE BUSINESS MIGHT
BE GONE THROUGH AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

SHE COULD NOT ENTER THE HOUSE AGAIN, COULD NOT BE IN THE SAME ROOM TO
WHICH SHE HAD WITH SUCH VAIN ARTIFICE RETREATED THREE MONTHS AGO, TO
LACE UP HER BOOT, WITHOUT RECOLLECTING. A THOUSAND VEXATIOUS THOUGHTS
WOULD RECUR. COMPLIMENTS, CHARADES, AND HORRIBLE BLUNDERS; AND IT WAS
NOT TO BE SUPPOSED THAT POOR HARRIET SHOULD NOT BE RECOLLECTING TOO; BUT
SHE BEHAVED VERY WELL, AND WAS ONLY RATHER PALE AND SILENT. THE VISIT
WAS OF COURSE SHORT; AND THERE WAS SO MUCH EMBARRASSMENT AND OCCUPATION
OF MIND TO SHORTEN IT, THAT EMMA WOULD NOT ALLOW HERSELF ENTIRELY TO
FORM AN OPINION OF THE LADY, AND ON NO ACCOUNT TO GIVE ONE, BEYOND THE
NOTHING-MEANING TERMS OF BEING "ELEGANTLY DRESSED, AND VERY PLEASING."

SHE DID NOT REALLY LIKE HER. SHE WOULD NOT BE IN A HURRY TO FIND FAULT,
BUT SHE SUSPECTED THAT THERE WAS NO ELEGANCE;--EASE, BUT NOT ELEGANCE.--
SHE WAS ALMOST SURE THAT FOR A YOUNG WOMAN, A STRANGER, A BRIDE, THERE
WAS TOO MUCH EASE. HER PERSON WAS RATHER GOOD; HER FACE NOT UNPRETTY;
BUT NEITHER FEATURE, NOR AIR, NOR VOICE, NOR MANNER, WERE ELEGANT. EMMA
THOUGHT AT LEAST IT WOULD TURN OUT SO.

AS FOR MR. ELTON, HIS MANNERS DID NOT APPEAR--BUT NO, SHE WOULD NOT
PERMIT A HASTY OR A WITTY WORD FROM HERSELF ABOUT HIS MANNERS. IT WAS AN
AWKWARD CEREMONY AT ANY TIME TO BE RECEIVING WEDDING VISITS, AND A MAN
HAD NEED BE ALL GRACE TO ACQUIT HIMSELF WELL THROUGH IT. THE WOMAN
WAS BETTER OFF; SHE MIGHT HAVE THE ASSISTANCE OF FINE CLOTHES, AND THE
PRIVILEGE OF BASHFULNESS, BUT THE MAN HAD ONLY HIS OWN GOOD SENSE TO
DEPEND ON; AND WHEN SHE CONSIDERED HOW PECULIARLY UNLUCKY POOR MR.
ELTON WAS IN BEING IN THE SAME ROOM AT ONCE WITH THE WOMAN HE HAD JUST
MARRIED, THE WOMAN HE HAD WANTED TO MARRY, AND THE WOMAN WHOM HE HAD
BEEN EXPECTED TO MARRY, SHE MUST ALLOW HIM TO HAVE THE RIGHT TO LOOK AS
LITTLE WISE, AND TO BE AS MUCH AFFECTEDLY, AND AS LITTLE REALLY EASY AS
COULD BE.

"WELL, MISS WOODHOUSE," SAID HARRIET, WHEN THEY HAD QUITTED THE
HOUSE, AND AFTER WAITING IN VAIN FOR HER FRIEND TO BEGIN; "WELL, MISS
WOODHOUSE, (WITH A GENTLE SIGH,) WHAT DO YOU THINK OF HER?--IS NOT SHE
VERY CHARMING?"

THERE WAS A LITTLE HESITATION IN EMMA'S ANSWER.

"OH! YES--VERY--A VERY PLEASING YOUNG WOMAN."

"I THINK HER BEAUTIFUL, QUITE BEAUTIFUL."

"VERY NICELY DRESSED, INDEED; A REMARKABLY ELEGANT GOWN."

"I AM NOT AT ALL SURPRIZED THAT HE SHOULD HAVE FALLEN IN LOVE."

"OH! NO--THERE IS NOTHING TO SURPRIZE ONE AT ALL.--A PRETTY FORTUNE; AND
SHE CAME IN HIS WAY."

"I DARE SAY," RETURNED HARRIET, SIGHING AGAIN, "I DARE SAY SHE WAS VERY
MUCH ATTACHED TO HIM."

"PERHAPS SHE MIGHT; BUT IT IS NOT EVERY MAN'S FATE TO MARRY THE WOMAN
WHO LOVES HIM BEST. MISS HAWKINS PERHAPS WANTED A HOME, AND THOUGHT THIS
THE BEST OFFER SHE WAS LIKELY TO HAVE."

"YES," SAID HARRIET EARNESTLY, "AND WELL SHE MIGHT, NOBODY COULD EVER
HAVE A BETTER. WELL, I WISH THEM HAPPY WITH ALL MY HEART. AND NOW, MISS
WOODHOUSE, I DO NOT THINK I SHALL MIND SEEING THEM AGAIN. HE IS JUST AS
SUPERIOR AS EVER;--BUT BEING MARRIED, YOU KNOW, IT IS QUITE A DIFFERENT
THING. NO, INDEED, MISS WOODHOUSE, YOU NEED NOT BE AFRAID; I CAN SIT AND
ADMIRE HIM NOW WITHOUT ANY GREAT MISERY. TO KNOW THAT HE HAS NOT THROWN
HIMSELF AWAY, IS SUCH A COMFORT!--SHE DOES SEEM A CHARMING YOUNG WOMAN,
JUST WHAT HE DESERVES. HAPPY CREATURE! HE CALLED HER 'AUGUSTA.' HOW
DELIGHTFUL!"

WHEN THE VISIT WAS RETURNED, EMMA MADE UP HER MIND. SHE COULD THEN SEE
MORE AND JUDGE BETTER. FROM HARRIET'S HAPPENING NOT TO BE AT HARTFIELD,
AND HER FATHER'S BEING PRESENT TO ENGAGE MR. ELTON, SHE HAD A QUARTER
OF AN HOUR OF THE LADY'S CONVERSATION TO HERSELF, AND COULD COMPOSEDLY
ATTEND TO HER; AND THE QUARTER OF AN HOUR QUITE CONVINCED HER THAT
MRS. ELTON WAS A VAIN WOMAN, EXTREMELY WELL SATISFIED WITH HERSELF, AND
THINKING MUCH OF HER OWN IMPORTANCE; THAT SHE MEANT TO SHINE AND BE VERY
SUPERIOR, BUT WITH MANNERS WHICH HAD BEEN FORMED IN A BAD SCHOOL, PERT
AND FAMILIAR; THAT ALL HER NOTIONS WERE DRAWN FROM ONE SET OF PEOPLE,
AND ONE STYLE OF LIVING; THAT IF NOT FOOLISH SHE WAS IGNORANT, AND THAT
HER SOCIETY WOULD CERTAINLY DO MR. ELTON NO GOOD.

HARRIET WOULD HAVE BEEN A BETTER MATCH. IF NOT WISE OR REFINED HERSELF,
SHE WOULD HAVE CONNECTED HIM WITH THOSE WHO WERE; BUT MISS HAWKINS, IT
MIGHT BE FAIRLY SUPPOSED FROM HER EASY CONCEIT, HAD BEEN THE BEST OF
HER OWN SET. THE RICH BROTHER-IN-LAW NEAR BRISTOL WAS THE PRIDE OF THE
ALLIANCE, AND HIS PLACE AND HIS CARRIAGES WERE THE PRIDE OF HIM.

THE VERY FIRST SUBJECT AFTER BEING SEATED WAS MAPLE GROVE, "MY BROTHER
MR. SUCKLING'S SEAT;"--A COMPARISON OF HARTFIELD TO MAPLE GROVE. THE
GROUNDS OF HARTFIELD WERE SMALL, BUT NEAT AND PRETTY; AND THE HOUSE WAS
MODERN AND WELL-BUILT. MRS. ELTON SEEMED MOST FAVOURABLY IMPRESSED
BY THE SIZE OF THE ROOM, THE ENTRANCE, AND ALL THAT SHE COULD SEE OR
IMAGINE. "VERY LIKE MAPLE GROVE INDEED!--SHE WAS QUITE STRUCK BY THE
LIKENESS!--THAT ROOM WAS THE VERY SHAPE AND SIZE OF THE MORNING-ROOM
AT MAPLE GROVE; HER SISTER'S FAVOURITE ROOM."--MR. ELTON WAS APPEALED
TO.--"WAS NOT IT ASTONISHINGLY LIKE?--SHE COULD REALLY ALMOST FANCY
HERSELF AT MAPLE GROVE."

"AND THE STAIRCASE--YOU KNOW, AS I CAME IN, I OBSERVED HOW VERY LIKE THE
STAIRCASE WAS; PLACED EXACTLY IN THE SAME PART OF THE HOUSE. I REALLY
COULD NOT HELP EXCLAIMING! I ASSURE YOU, MISS WOODHOUSE, IT IS VERY
DELIGHTFUL TO ME, TO BE REMINDED OF A PLACE I AM SO EXTREMELY PARTIAL TO
AS MAPLE GROVE. I HAVE SPENT SO MANY HAPPY MONTHS THERE! (WITH A LITTLE
SIGH OF SENTIMENT). A CHARMING PLACE, UNDOUBTEDLY. EVERY BODY WHO
SEES IT IS STRUCK BY ITS BEAUTY; BUT TO ME, IT HAS BEEN QUITE A HOME.
WHENEVER YOU ARE TRANSPLANTED, LIKE ME, MISS WOODHOUSE, YOU WILL
UNDERSTAND HOW VERY DELIGHTFUL IT IS TO MEET WITH ANY THING AT ALL LIKE
WHAT ONE HAS LEFT BEHIND. I ALWAYS SAY THIS IS QUITE ONE OF THE EVILS OF
MATRIMONY."

EMMA MADE AS SLIGHT A REPLY AS SHE COULD; BUT IT WAS FULLY SUFFICIENT
FOR MRS. ELTON, WHO ONLY WANTED TO BE TALKING HERSELF.

"SO EXTREMELY LIKE MAPLE GROVE! AND IT IS NOT MERELY THE HOUSE--THE
GROUNDS, I ASSURE YOU, AS FAR AS I COULD OBSERVE, ARE STRIKINGLY LIKE.
THE LAURELS AT MAPLE GROVE ARE IN THE SAME PROFUSION AS HERE, AND STAND
VERY MUCH IN THE SAME WAY--JUST ACROSS THE LAWN; AND I HAD A GLIMPSE
OF A FINE LARGE TREE, WITH A BENCH ROUND IT, WHICH PUT ME SO EXACTLY IN
MIND! MY BROTHER AND SISTER WILL BE ENCHANTED WITH THIS PLACE. PEOPLE
WHO HAVE EXTENSIVE GROUNDS THEMSELVES ARE ALWAYS PLEASED WITH ANY THING
IN THE SAME STYLE."

EMMA DOUBTED THE TRUTH OF THIS SENTIMENT. SHE HAD A GREAT IDEA THAT
PEOPLE WHO HAD EXTENSIVE GROUNDS THEMSELVES CARED VERY LITTLE FOR THE
EXTENSIVE GROUNDS OF ANY BODY ELSE; BUT IT WAS NOT WORTH WHILE TO ATTACK
AN ERROR SO DOUBLE-DYED, AND THEREFORE ONLY SAID IN REPLY,

"WHEN YOU HAVE SEEN MORE OF THIS COUNTRY, I AM AFRAID YOU WILL THINK YOU
HAVE OVERRATED HARTFIELD. SURRY IS FULL OF BEAUTIES."

"OH! YES, I AM QUITE AWARE OF THAT. IT IS THE GARDEN OF ENGLAND, YOU
KNOW. SURRY IS THE GARDEN OF ENGLAND."

"YES; BUT WE MUST NOT REST OUR CLAIMS ON THAT DISTINCTION. MANY
COUNTIES, I BELIEVE, ARE CALLED THE GARDEN OF ENGLAND, AS WELL AS
SURRY."

"NO, I FANCY NOT," REPLIED MRS. ELTON, WITH A MOST SATISFIED SMILE.
"I NEVER HEARD ANY COUNTY BUT SURRY CALLED SO."

EMMA WAS SILENCED.

"MY BROTHER AND SISTER HAVE PROMISED US A VISIT IN THE SPRING, OR SUMMER
AT FARTHEST," CONTINUED MRS. ELTON; "AND THAT WILL BE OUR TIME FOR
EXPLORING. WHILE THEY ARE WITH US, WE SHALL EXPLORE A GREAT DEAL, I DARE
SAY. THEY WILL HAVE THEIR BAROUCHE-LANDAU, OF COURSE, WHICH HOLDS FOUR
PERFECTLY; AND THEREFORE, WITHOUT SAYING ANY THING OF OUR CARRIAGE,
WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO EXPLORE THE DIFFERENT BEAUTIES EXTREMELY WELL. THEY
WOULD HARDLY COME IN THEIR CHAISE, I THINK, AT THAT SEASON OF THE
YEAR. INDEED, WHEN THE TIME DRAWS ON, I SHALL DECIDEDLY RECOMMEND THEIR
BRINGING THE BAROUCHE-LANDAU; IT WILL BE SO VERY MUCH PREFERABLE.
WHEN PEOPLE COME INTO A BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY OF THIS SORT, YOU KNOW, MISS
WOODHOUSE, ONE NATURALLY WISHES THEM TO SEE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE; AND MR.
SUCKLING IS EXTREMELY FOND OF EXPLORING. WE EXPLORED TO KING'S-WESTON
TWICE LAST SUMMER, IN THAT WAY, MOST DELIGHTFULLY, JUST AFTER THEIR
FIRST HAVING THE BAROUCHE-LANDAU. YOU HAVE MANY PARTIES OF THAT KIND
HERE, I SUPPOSE, MISS WOODHOUSE, EVERY SUMMER?"

"NO; NOT IMMEDIATELY HERE. WE ARE RATHER OUT OF DISTANCE OF THE VERY
STRIKING BEAUTIES WHICH ATTRACT THE SORT OF PARTIES YOU SPEAK OF; AND WE
ARE A VERY QUIET SET OF PEOPLE, I BELIEVE; MORE DISPOSED TO STAY AT HOME
THAN ENGAGE IN SCHEMES OF PLEASURE."

"AH! THERE IS NOTHING LIKE STAYING AT HOME FOR REAL COMFORT. NOBODY CAN
BE MORE DEVOTED TO HOME THAN I AM. I WAS QUITE A PROVERB FOR IT AT MAPLE
GROVE. MANY A TIME HAS SELINA SAID, WHEN SHE HAS BEEN GOING TO BRISTOL,
'I REALLY CANNOT GET THIS GIRL TO MOVE FROM THE HOUSE. I ABSOLUTELY MUST
GO IN BY MYSELF, THOUGH I HATE BEING STUCK UP IN THE BAROUCHE-LANDAU
WITHOUT A COMPANION; BUT AUGUSTA, I BELIEVE, WITH HER OWN GOOD-WILL,
WOULD NEVER STIR BEYOND THE PARK PALING.' MANY A TIME HAS SHE SAID SO;
AND YET I AM NO ADVOCATE FOR ENTIRE SECLUSION. I THINK, ON THE CONTRARY,
WHEN PEOPLE SHUT THEMSELVES UP ENTIRELY FROM SOCIETY, IT IS A VERY
BAD THING; AND THAT IT IS MUCH MORE ADVISABLE TO MIX IN THE WORLD IN
A PROPER DEGREE, WITHOUT LIVING IN IT EITHER TOO MUCH OR TOO LITTLE. I
PERFECTLY UNDERSTAND YOUR SITUATION, HOWEVER, MISS WOODHOUSE--(LOOKING
TOWARDS MR. WOODHOUSE), YOUR FATHER'S STATE OF HEALTH MUST BE A GREAT
DRAWBACK. WHY DOES NOT HE TRY BATH?--INDEED HE SHOULD. LET ME RECOMMEND
BATH TO YOU. I ASSURE YOU I HAVE NO DOUBT OF ITS DOING MR. WOODHOUSE
GOOD."

"MY FATHER TRIED IT MORE THAN ONCE, FORMERLY; BUT WITHOUT RECEIVING ANY
BENEFIT; AND MR. PERRY, WHOSE NAME, I DARE SAY, IS NOT UNKNOWN TO YOU,
DOES NOT CONCEIVE IT WOULD BE AT ALL MORE LIKELY TO BE USEFUL NOW."

"AH! THAT'S A GREAT PITY; FOR I ASSURE YOU, MISS WOODHOUSE, WHERE THE
WATERS DO AGREE, IT IS QUITE WONDERFUL THE RELIEF THEY GIVE. IN MY BATH
LIFE, I HAVE SEEN SUCH INSTANCES OF IT! AND IT IS SO CHEERFUL A PLACE,
THAT IT COULD NOT FAIL OF BEING OF USE TO MR. WOODHOUSE'S SPIRITS,
WHICH, I UNDERSTAND, ARE SOMETIMES MUCH DEPRESSED. AND AS TO ITS
RECOMMENDATIONS TO YOU, I FANCY I NEED NOT TAKE MUCH PAINS TO DWELL
ON THEM. THE ADVANTAGES OF BATH TO THE YOUNG ARE PRETTY GENERALLY
UNDERSTOOD. IT WOULD BE A CHARMING INTRODUCTION FOR YOU, WHO HAVE LIVED
SO SECLUDED A LIFE; AND I COULD IMMEDIATELY SECURE YOU SOME OF THE BEST
SOCIETY IN THE PLACE. A LINE FROM ME WOULD BRING YOU A LITTLE HOST OF
ACQUAINTANCE; AND MY PARTICULAR FRIEND, MRS. PARTRIDGE, THE LADY I HAVE
ALWAYS RESIDED WITH WHEN IN BATH, WOULD BE MOST HAPPY TO SHEW YOU ANY
ATTENTIONS, AND WOULD BE THE VERY PERSON FOR YOU TO GO INTO PUBLIC
WITH."

IT WAS AS MUCH AS EMMA COULD BEAR, WITHOUT BEING IMPOLITE. THE IDEA
OF HER BEING INDEBTED TO MRS. ELTON FOR WHAT WAS CALLED AN
INTRODUCTION--OF HER GOING INTO PUBLIC UNDER THE AUSPICES OF A FRIEND
OF MRS. ELTON'S--PROBABLY SOME VULGAR, DASHING WIDOW, WHO, WITH THE
HELP OF A BOARDER, JUST MADE A SHIFT TO LIVE!--THE DIGNITY OF MISS
WOODHOUSE, OF HARTFIELD, WAS SUNK INDEED!

SHE RESTRAINED HERSELF, HOWEVER, FROM ANY OF THE REPROOFS SHE COULD HAVE
GIVEN, AND ONLY THANKED MRS. ELTON COOLLY; "BUT THEIR GOING TO BATH WAS
QUITE OUT OF THE QUESTION; AND SHE WAS NOT PERFECTLY CONVINCED THAT
THE PLACE MIGHT SUIT HER BETTER THAN HER FATHER." AND THEN, TO PREVENT
FARTHER OUTRAGE AND INDIGNATION, CHANGED THE SUBJECT DIRECTLY.

"I DO NOT ASK WHETHER YOU ARE MUSICAL, MRS. ELTON. UPON THESE OCCASIONS,
A LADY'S CHARACTER GENERALLY PRECEDES HER; AND HIGHBURY HAS LONG KNOWN
THAT YOU ARE A SUPERIOR PERFORMER."

"OH! NO, INDEED; I MUST PROTEST AGAINST ANY SUCH IDEA. A SUPERIOR
PERFORMER!--VERY FAR FROM IT, I ASSURE YOU. CONSIDER FROM HOW PARTIAL
A QUARTER YOUR INFORMATION CAME. I AM DOATINGLY FOND OF
MUSIC--PASSIONATELY FOND;--AND MY FRIENDS SAY I AM NOT ENTIRELY DEVOID
OF TASTE; BUT AS TO ANY THING ELSE, UPON MY HONOUR MY PERFORMANCE IS
MEDIOCRE TO THE LAST DEGREE. YOU, MISS WOODHOUSE, I WELL KNOW, PLAY
DELIGHTFULLY. I ASSURE YOU IT HAS BEEN THE GREATEST SATISFACTION,
COMFORT, AND DELIGHT TO ME, TO HEAR WHAT A MUSICAL SOCIETY I AM GOT
INTO. I ABSOLUTELY CANNOT DO WITHOUT MUSIC. IT IS A NECESSARY OF LIFE TO
ME; AND HAVING ALWAYS BEEN USED TO A VERY MUSICAL SOCIETY, BOTH AT
MAPLE GROVE AND IN BATH, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A MOST SERIOUS SACRIFICE. I
HONESTLY SAID AS MUCH TO MR. E. WHEN HE WAS SPEAKING OF MY FUTURE
HOME, AND EXPRESSING HIS FEARS LEST THE RETIREMENT OF IT SHOULD BE
DISAGREEABLE; AND THE INFERIORITY OF THE HOUSE TOO--KNOWING WHAT I HAD
BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO--OF COURSE HE WAS NOT WHOLLY WITHOUT APPREHENSION.
WHEN HE WAS SPEAKING OF IT IN THAT WAY, I HONESTLY SAID THAT THE
WORLD I COULD GIVE UP--PARTIES, BALLS, PLAYS--FOR I HAD NO FEAR OF
RETIREMENT. BLESSED WITH SO MANY RESOURCES WITHIN MYSELF, THE WORLD WAS
NOT NECESSARY TO ME. I COULD DO VERY WELL WITHOUT IT. TO THOSE WHO HAD
NO RESOURCES IT WAS A DIFFERENT THING; BUT MY RESOURCES MADE ME QUITE
INDEPENDENT. AND AS TO SMALLER-SIZED ROOMS THAN I HAD BEEN USED TO, I
REALLY COULD NOT GIVE IT A THOUGHT. I HOPED I WAS PERFECTLY EQUAL TO ANY
SACRIFICE OF THAT DESCRIPTION. CERTAINLY I HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO EVERY
LUXURY AT MAPLE GROVE; BUT I DID ASSURE HIM THAT TWO CARRIAGES WERE NOT
NECESSARY TO MY HAPPINESS, NOR WERE SPACIOUS APARTMENTS. 'BUT,' SAID I,
'TO BE QUITE HONEST, I DO NOT THINK I CAN LIVE WITHOUT SOMETHING OF A
MUSICAL SOCIETY. I CONDITION FOR NOTHING ELSE; BUT WITHOUT MUSIC, LIFE
WOULD BE A BLANK TO ME.'"

"WE CANNOT SUPPOSE," SAID EMMA, SMILING, "THAT MR. ELTON WOULD HESITATE
TO ASSURE YOU OF THERE BEING A VERY MUSICAL SOCIETY IN HIGHBURY; AND
I HOPE YOU WILL NOT FIND HE HAS OUTSTEPPED THE TRUTH MORE THAN MAY BE
PARDONED, IN CONSIDERATION OF THE MOTIVE."

"NO, INDEED, I HAVE NO DOUBTS AT ALL ON THAT HEAD. I AM DELIGHTED TO
FIND MYSELF IN SUCH A CIRCLE. I HOPE WE SHALL HAVE MANY SWEET LITTLE
CONCERTS TOGETHER. I THINK, MISS WOODHOUSE, YOU AND I MUST ESTABLISH A
MUSICAL CLUB, AND HAVE REGULAR WEEKLY MEETINGS AT YOUR HOUSE, OR OURS.
WILL NOT IT BE A GOOD PLAN? IF WE EXERT OURSELVES, I THINK WE SHALL
NOT BE LONG IN WANT OF ALLIES. SOMETHING OF THAT NATURE WOULD BE
PARTICULARLY DESIRABLE FOR ME, AS AN INDUCEMENT TO KEEP ME IN
PRACTICE; FOR MARRIED WOMEN, YOU KNOW--THERE IS A SAD STORY AGAINST
THEM, IN GENERAL. THEY ARE BUT TOO APT TO GIVE UP MUSIC."

"BUT YOU, WHO ARE SO EXTREMELY FOND OF IT--THERE CAN BE NO DANGER,
SURELY?"

"I SHOULD HOPE NOT; BUT REALLY WHEN I LOOK AROUND AMONG MY ACQUAINTANCE,
I TREMBLE. SELINA HAS ENTIRELY GIVEN UP MUSIC--NEVER TOUCHES THE
INSTRUMENT--THOUGH SHE PLAYED SWEETLY. AND THE SAME MAY BE SAID OF MRS.
JEFFEREYS--CLARA PARTRIDGE, THAT WAS--AND OF THE TWO MILMANS, NOW MRS.
BIRD AND MRS. JAMES COOPER; AND OF MORE THAN I CAN ENUMERATE. UPON MY
WORD IT IS ENOUGH TO PUT ONE IN A FRIGHT. I USED TO BE QUITE ANGRY WITH
SELINA; BUT REALLY I BEGIN NOW TO COMPREHEND THAT A MARRIED WOMAN HAS
MANY THINGS TO CALL HER ATTENTION. I BELIEVE I WAS HALF AN HOUR THIS
MORNING SHUT UP WITH MY HOUSEKEEPER."

"BUT EVERY THING OF THAT KIND," SAID EMMA, "WILL SOON BE IN SO REGULAR A
TRAIN--"

"WELL," SAID MRS. ELTON, LAUGHING, "WE SHALL SEE."

EMMA, FINDING HER SO DETERMINED UPON NEGLECTING HER MUSIC, HAD NOTHING
MORE TO SAY; AND, AFTER A MOMENT'S PAUSE, MRS. ELTON CHOSE ANOTHER
SUBJECT.

"WE HAVE BEEN CALLING AT RANDALLS," SAID SHE, "AND FOUND THEM BOTH AT
HOME; AND VERY PLEASANT PEOPLE THEY SEEM TO BE. I LIKE THEM EXTREMELY.
MR. WESTON SEEMS AN EXCELLENT CREATURE--QUITE A FIRST-RATE FAVOURITE
WITH ME ALREADY, I ASSURE YOU. AND SHE APPEARS SO TRULY GOOD--THERE IS
SOMETHING SO MOTHERLY AND KIND-HEARTED ABOUT HER, THAT IT WINS UPON ONE
DIRECTLY. SHE WAS YOUR GOVERNESS, I THINK?"

EMMA WAS ALMOST TOO MUCH ASTONISHED TO ANSWER; BUT MRS. ELTON HARDLY
WAITED FOR THE AFFIRMATIVE BEFORE SHE WENT ON.

"HAVING UNDERSTOOD AS MUCH, I WAS RATHER ASTONISHED TO FIND HER SO VERY
LADY-LIKE! BUT SHE IS REALLY QUITE THE GENTLEWOMAN."

"MRS. WESTON'S MANNERS," SAID EMMA, "WERE ALWAYS PARTICULARLY GOOD.
THEIR PROPRIETY, SIMPLICITY, AND ELEGANCE, WOULD MAKE THEM THE SAFEST
MODEL FOR ANY YOUNG WOMAN."

"AND WHO DO YOU THINK CAME IN WHILE WE WERE THERE?"

EMMA WAS QUITE AT A LOSS. THE TONE IMPLIED SOME OLD ACQUAINTANCE--AND
HOW COULD SHE POSSIBLY GUESS?

"KNIGHTLEY!" CONTINUED MRS. ELTON; "KNIGHTLEY HIMSELF!--WAS NOT IT
LUCKY?--FOR, NOT BEING WITHIN WHEN HE CALLED THE OTHER DAY, I HAD NEVER
SEEN HIM BEFORE; AND OF COURSE, AS SO PARTICULAR A FRIEND OF MR. E.'S,
I HAD A GREAT CURIOSITY. 'MY FRIEND KNIGHTLEY' HAD BEEN SO OFTEN
MENTIONED, THAT I WAS REALLY IMPATIENT TO SEE HIM; AND I MUST DO MY
CARO SPOSO THE JUSTICE TO SAY THAT HE NEED NOT BE ASHAMED OF HIS FRIEND.
KNIGHTLEY IS QUITE THE GENTLEMAN. I LIKE HIM VERY MUCH. DECIDEDLY, I
THINK, A VERY GENTLEMAN-LIKE MAN."

HAPPILY, IT WAS NOW TIME TO BE GONE. THEY WERE OFF; AND EMMA COULD
BREATHE.

"INSUFFERABLE WOMAN!" WAS HER IMMEDIATE EXCLAMATION. "WORSE THAN I HAD
SUPPOSED. ABSOLUTELY INSUFFERABLE! KNIGHTLEY!--I COULD NOT HAVE
BELIEVED IT. KNIGHTLEY!--NEVER SEEN HIM IN HER LIFE BEFORE, AND CALL
HIM KNIGHTLEY!--AND DISCOVER THAT HE IS A GENTLEMAN! A LITTLE UPSTART,
VULGAR BEING, WITH HER MR. E., AND HER CARO SPOSO, AND HER
RESOURCES, AND ALL HER AIRS OF PERT PRETENSION AND UNDERBRED FINERY.
ACTUALLY TO DISCOVER THAT MR. KNIGHTLEY IS A GENTLEMAN! I DOUBT WHETHER
HE WILL RETURN THE COMPLIMENT, AND DISCOVER HER TO BE A LADY. I COULD
NOT HAVE BELIEVED IT! AND TO PROPOSE THAT SHE AND I SHOULD UNITE TO
FORM A MUSICAL CLUB! ONE WOULD FANCY WE WERE BOSOM FRIENDS! AND MRS.
WESTON!--ASTONISHED THAT THE PERSON WHO HAD BROUGHT ME UP SHOULD BE A
GENTLEWOMAN! WORSE AND WORSE. I NEVER MET WITH HER EQUAL. MUCH BEYOND
MY HOPES. HARRIET IS DISGRACED BY ANY COMPARISON. OH! WHAT WOULD FRANK
CHURCHILL SAY TO HER, IF HE WERE HERE? HOW ANGRY AND HOW DIVERTED HE
WOULD BE! AH! THERE I AM--THINKING OF HIM DIRECTLY. ALWAYS THE FIRST
PERSON TO BE THOUGHT OF! HOW I CATCH MYSELF OUT! FRANK CHURCHILL COMES
AS REGULARLY INTO MY MIND!"--

ALL THIS RAN SO GLIBLY THROUGH HER THOUGHTS, THAT BY THE TIME HER FATHER
HAD ARRANGED HIMSELF, AFTER THE BUSTLE OF THE ELTONS' DEPARTURE, AND WAS
READY TO SPEAK, SHE WAS VERY TOLERABLY CAPABLE OF ATTENDING.

"WELL, MY DEAR," HE DELIBERATELY BEGAN, "CONSIDERING WE NEVER SAW HER
BEFORE, SHE SEEMS A VERY PRETTY SORT OF YOUNG LADY; AND I DARE SAY SHE
WAS VERY MUCH PLEASED WITH YOU. SHE SPEAKS A LITTLE TOO QUICK. A LITTLE
QUICKNESS OF VOICE THERE IS WHICH RATHER HURTS THE EAR. BUT I BELIEVE
I AM NICE; I DO NOT LIKE STRANGE VOICES; AND NOBODY SPEAKS LIKE YOU AND
POOR MISS TAYLOR. HOWEVER, SHE SEEMS A VERY OBLIGING, PRETTY-BEHAVED
YOUNG LADY, AND NO DOUBT WILL MAKE HIM A VERY GOOD WIFE. THOUGH I THINK
HE HAD BETTER NOT HAVE MARRIED. I MADE THE BEST EXCUSES I COULD FOR NOT
HAVING BEEN ABLE TO WAIT ON HIM AND MRS. ELTON ON THIS HAPPY OCCASION; I
SAID THAT I HOPED I SHOULD IN THE COURSE OF THE SUMMER. BUT I OUGHT TO
HAVE GONE BEFORE. NOT TO WAIT UPON A BRIDE IS VERY REMISS. AH! IT SHEWS
WHAT A SAD INVALID I AM! BUT I DO NOT LIKE THE CORNER INTO VICARAGE
LANE."

"I DARE SAY YOUR APOLOGIES WERE ACCEPTED, SIR. MR. ELTON KNOWS YOU."

"YES: BUT A YOUNG LADY--A BRIDE--I OUGHT TO HAVE PAID MY RESPECTS TO HER
IF POSSIBLE. IT WAS BEING VERY DEFICIENT."

"BUT, MY DEAR PAPA, YOU ARE NO FRIEND TO MATRIMONY; AND THEREFORE WHY
SHOULD YOU BE SO ANXIOUS TO PAY YOUR RESPECTS TO A BRIDE? IT OUGHT TO
BE NO RECOMMENDATION TO YOU. IT IS ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO MARRY IF YOU
MAKE SO MUCH OF THEM."

"NO, MY DEAR, I NEVER ENCOURAGED ANY BODY TO MARRY, BUT I WOULD ALWAYS
WISH TO PAY EVERY PROPER ATTENTION TO A LADY--AND A BRIDE, ESPECIALLY,
IS NEVER TO BE NEGLECTED. MORE IS AVOWEDLY DUE TO HER. A BRIDE, YOU
KNOW, MY DEAR, IS ALWAYS THE FIRST IN COMPANY, LET THE OTHERS BE WHO
THEY MAY."

"WELL, PAPA, IF THIS IS NOT ENCOURAGEMENT TO MARRY, I DO NOT KNOW WHAT
IS. AND I SHOULD NEVER HAVE EXPECTED YOU TO BE LENDING YOUR SANCTION TO
SUCH VANITY-BAITS FOR POOR YOUNG LADIES."

"MY DEAR, YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND ME. THIS IS A MATTER OF MERE
COMMON POLITENESS AND GOOD-BREEDING, AND HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ANY
ENCOURAGEMENT TO PEOPLE TO MARRY."

EMMA HAD DONE. HER FATHER WAS GROWING NERVOUS, AND COULD NOT UNDERSTAND
HER. HER MIND RETURNED TO MRS. ELTON'S OFFENCES, AND LONG, VERY LONG,
DID THEY OCCUPY HER.



CHAPTER XV


EMMA WAS NOT REQUIRED, BY ANY SUBSEQUENT DISCOVERY, TO RETRACT HER ILL
OPINION OF MRS. ELTON. HER OBSERVATION HAD BEEN PRETTY CORRECT. SUCH AS
MRS. ELTON APPEARED TO HER ON THIS SECOND INTERVIEW, SUCH SHE APPEARED
WHENEVER THEY MET AGAIN,--SELF-IMPORTANT, PRESUMING, FAMILIAR, IGNORANT,
AND ILL-BRED. SHE HAD A LITTLE BEAUTY AND A LITTLE ACCOMPLISHMENT,
BUT SO LITTLE JUDGMENT THAT SHE THOUGHT HERSELF COMING WITH SUPERIOR
KNOWLEDGE OF THE WORLD, TO ENLIVEN AND IMPROVE A COUNTRY NEIGHBOURHOOD;
AND CONCEIVED MISS HAWKINS TO HAVE HELD SUCH A PLACE IN SOCIETY AS MRS.
ELTON'S CONSEQUENCE ONLY COULD SURPASS.

THERE WAS NO REASON TO SUPPOSE MR. ELTON THOUGHT AT ALL DIFFERENTLY FROM
HIS WIFE. HE SEEMED NOT MERELY HAPPY WITH HER, BUT PROUD. HE HAD THE AIR
OF CONGRATULATING HIMSELF ON HAVING BROUGHT SUCH A WOMAN TO HIGHBURY,
AS NOT EVEN MISS WOODHOUSE COULD EQUAL; AND THE GREATER PART OF HER
NEW ACQUAINTANCE, DISPOSED TO COMMEND, OR NOT IN THE HABIT OF JUDGING,
FOLLOWING THE LEAD OF MISS BATES'S GOOD-WILL, OR TAKING IT FOR GRANTED
THAT THE BRIDE MUST BE AS CLEVER AND AS AGREEABLE AS SHE PROFESSED
HERSELF, WERE VERY WELL SATISFIED; SO THAT MRS. ELTON'S PRAISE
PASSED FROM ONE MOUTH TO ANOTHER AS IT OUGHT TO DO, UNIMPEDED BY MISS
WOODHOUSE, WHO READILY CONTINUED HER FIRST CONTRIBUTION AND TALKED WITH
A GOOD GRACE OF HER BEING "VERY PLEASANT AND VERY ELEGANTLY DRESSED."

IN ONE RESPECT MRS. ELTON GREW EVEN WORSE THAN SHE HAD APPEARED AT
FIRST. HER FEELINGS ALTERED TOWARDS EMMA.--OFFENDED, PROBABLY, BY THE
LITTLE ENCOURAGEMENT WHICH HER PROPOSALS OF INTIMACY MET WITH, SHE DREW
BACK IN HER TURN AND GRADUALLY BECAME MUCH MORE COLD AND DISTANT; AND
THOUGH THE EFFECT WAS AGREEABLE, THE ILL-WILL WHICH PRODUCED IT WAS
NECESSARILY INCREASING EMMA'S DISLIKE. HER MANNERS, TOO--AND MR.
ELTON'S, WERE UNPLEASANT TOWARDS HARRIET. THEY WERE SNEERING AND
NEGLIGENT. EMMA HOPED IT MUST RAPIDLY WORK HARRIET'S CURE; BUT THE
SENSATIONS WHICH COULD PROMPT SUCH BEHAVIOUR SUNK THEM BOTH VERY
MUCH.--IT WAS NOT TO BE DOUBTED THAT POOR HARRIET'S ATTACHMENT HAD BEEN
AN OFFERING TO CONJUGAL UNRESERVE, AND HER OWN SHARE IN THE STORY, UNDER
A COLOURING THE LEAST FAVOURABLE TO HER AND THE MOST SOOTHING TO HIM,
HAD IN ALL LIKELIHOOD BEEN GIVEN ALSO. SHE WAS, OF COURSE, THE OBJECT
OF THEIR JOINT DISLIKE.--WHEN THEY HAD NOTHING ELSE TO SAY, IT MUST BE
ALWAYS EASY TO BEGIN ABUSING MISS WOODHOUSE; AND THE ENMITY WHICH
THEY DARED NOT SHEW IN OPEN DISRESPECT TO HER, FOUND A BROADER VENT IN
CONTEMPTUOUS TREATMENT OF HARRIET.

MRS. ELTON TOOK A GREAT FANCY TO JANE FAIRFAX; AND FROM THE FIRST. NOT
MERELY WHEN A STATE OF WARFARE WITH ONE YOUNG LADY MIGHT BE SUPPOSED TO
RECOMMEND THE OTHER, BUT FROM THE VERY FIRST; AND SHE WAS NOT SATISFIED
WITH EXPRESSING A NATURAL AND REASONABLE ADMIRATION--BUT WITHOUT
SOLICITATION, OR PLEA, OR PRIVILEGE, SHE MUST BE WANTING TO ASSIST AND
BEFRIEND HER.--BEFORE EMMA HAD FORFEITED HER CONFIDENCE, AND ABOUT THE
THIRD TIME OF THEIR MEETING, SHE HEARD ALL MRS. ELTON'S KNIGHT-ERRANTRY
ON THE SUBJECT.--

"JANE FAIRFAX IS ABSOLUTELY CHARMING, MISS WOODHOUSE.--I QUITE RAVE
ABOUT JANE FAIRFAX.--A SWEET, INTERESTING CREATURE. SO MILD AND
LADYLIKE--AND WITH SUCH TALENTS!--I ASSURE YOU I THINK SHE HAS VERY
EXTRAORDINARY TALENTS. I DO NOT SCRUPLE TO SAY THAT SHE PLAYS EXTREMELY
WELL. I KNOW ENOUGH OF MUSIC TO SPEAK DECIDEDLY ON THAT POINT. OH! SHE
IS ABSOLUTELY CHARMING! YOU WILL LAUGH AT MY WARMTH--BUT, UPON MY WORD,
I TALK OF NOTHING BUT JANE FAIRFAX.--AND HER SITUATION IS SO CALCULATED
TO AFFECT ONE!--MISS WOODHOUSE, WE MUST EXERT OURSELVES AND ENDEAVOUR
TO DO SOMETHING FOR HER. WE MUST BRING HER FORWARD. SUCH TALENT AS HERS
MUST NOT BE SUFFERED TO REMAIN UNKNOWN.--I DARE SAY YOU HAVE HEARD THOSE
CHARMING LINES OF THE POET,

        'FULL MANY A FLOWER IS BORN TO BLUSH UNSEEN,
          'AND WASTE ITS FRAGRANCE ON THE DESERT AIR.'

WE MUST NOT ALLOW THEM TO BE VERIFIED IN SWEET JANE FAIRFAX."

"I CANNOT THINK THERE IS ANY DANGER OF IT," WAS EMMA'S CALM ANSWER--"AND
WHEN YOU ARE BETTER ACQUAINTED WITH MISS FAIRFAX'S SITUATION AND
UNDERSTAND WHAT HER HOME HAS BEEN, WITH COLONEL AND MRS. CAMPBELL, I
HAVE NO IDEA THAT YOU WILL SUPPOSE HER TALENTS CAN BE UNKNOWN."

"OH! BUT DEAR MISS WOODHOUSE, SHE IS NOW IN SUCH RETIREMENT, SUCH
OBSCURITY, SO THROWN AWAY.--WHATEVER ADVANTAGES SHE MAY HAVE ENJOYED
WITH THE CAMPBELLS ARE SO PALPABLY AT AN END! AND I THINK SHE FEELS IT.
I AM SURE SHE DOES. SHE IS VERY TIMID AND SILENT. ONE CAN SEE THAT SHE
FEELS THE WANT OF ENCOURAGEMENT. I LIKE HER THE BETTER FOR IT. I
MUST CONFESS IT IS A RECOMMENDATION TO ME. I AM A GREAT ADVOCATE FOR
TIMIDITY--AND I AM SURE ONE DOES NOT OFTEN MEET WITH IT.--BUT IN THOSE
WHO ARE AT ALL INFERIOR, IT IS EXTREMELY PREPOSSESSING. OH! I ASSURE
YOU, JANE FAIRFAX IS A VERY DELIGHTFUL CHARACTER, AND INTERESTS ME MORE
THAN I CAN EXPRESS."

"YOU APPEAR TO FEEL A GREAT DEAL--BUT I AM NOT AWARE HOW YOU OR ANY OF
MISS FAIRFAX'S ACQUAINTANCE HERE, ANY OF THOSE WHO HAVE KNOWN HER LONGER
THAN YOURSELF, CAN SHEW HER ANY OTHER ATTENTION THAN"--

"MY DEAR MISS WOODHOUSE, A VAST DEAL MAY BE DONE BY THOSE WHO DARE TO
ACT. YOU AND I NEED NOT BE AFRAID. IF WE SET THE EXAMPLE, MANY WILL
FOLLOW IT AS FAR AS THEY CAN; THOUGH ALL HAVE NOT OUR SITUATIONS. WE
HAVE CARRIAGES TO FETCH AND CONVEY HER HOME, AND WE LIVE IN A STYLE
WHICH COULD NOT MAKE THE ADDITION OF JANE FAIRFAX, AT ANY TIME, THE
LEAST INCONVENIENT.--I SHOULD BE EXTREMELY DISPLEASED IF WRIGHT WERE TO
SEND US UP SUCH A DINNER, AS COULD MAKE ME REGRET HAVING ASKED MORE
THAN JANE FAIRFAX TO PARTAKE OF IT. I HAVE NO IDEA OF THAT SORT OF
THING. IT IS NOT LIKELY THAT I SHOULD, CONSIDERING WHAT I HAVE BEEN
USED TO. MY GREATEST DANGER, PERHAPS, IN HOUSEKEEPING, MAY BE QUITE THE
OTHER WAY, IN DOING TOO MUCH, AND BEING TOO CARELESS OF EXPENSE. MAPLE
GROVE WILL PROBABLY BE MY MODEL MORE THAN IT OUGHT TO BE--FOR WE DO NOT
AT ALL AFFECT TO EQUAL MY BROTHER, MR. SUCKLING, IN INCOME.--HOWEVER, MY
RESOLUTION IS TAKEN AS TO NOTICING JANE FAIRFAX.--I SHALL CERTAINLY HAVE
HER VERY OFTEN AT MY HOUSE, SHALL INTRODUCE HER WHEREVER I CAN, SHALL
HAVE MUSICAL PARTIES TO DRAW OUT HER TALENTS, AND SHALL BE CONSTANTLY
ON THE WATCH FOR AN ELIGIBLE SITUATION. MY ACQUAINTANCE IS SO VERY
EXTENSIVE, THAT I HAVE LITTLE DOUBT OF HEARING OF SOMETHING TO SUIT
HER SHORTLY.--I SHALL INTRODUCE HER, OF COURSE, VERY PARTICULARLY TO MY
BROTHER AND SISTER WHEN THEY COME TO US. I AM SURE THEY WILL LIKE HER
EXTREMELY; AND WHEN SHE GETS A LITTLE ACQUAINTED WITH THEM, HER FEARS
WILL COMPLETELY WEAR OFF, FOR THERE REALLY IS NOTHING IN THE MANNERS
OF EITHER BUT WHAT IS HIGHLY CONCILIATING.--I SHALL HAVE HER VERY OFTEN
INDEED WHILE THEY ARE WITH ME, AND I DARE SAY WE SHALL SOMETIMES FIND A
SEAT FOR HER IN THE BAROUCHE-LANDAU IN SOME OF OUR EXPLORING PARTIES."

"POOR JANE FAIRFAX!"--THOUGHT EMMA.--"YOU HAVE NOT DESERVED THIS. YOU
MAY HAVE DONE WRONG WITH REGARD TO MR. DIXON, BUT THIS IS A PUNISHMENT
BEYOND WHAT YOU CAN HAVE MERITED!--THE KINDNESS AND PROTECTION OF MRS.
ELTON!--'JANE FAIRFAX AND JANE FAIRFAX.' HEAVENS! LET ME NOT SUPPOSE
THAT SHE DARES GO ABOUT, EMMA WOODHOUSE-ING ME!--BUT UPON MY HONOUR,
THERE SEEMS NO LIMITS TO THE LICENTIOUSNESS OF THAT WOMAN'S TONGUE!"

EMMA HAD NOT TO LISTEN TO SUCH PARADINGS AGAIN--TO ANY SO EXCLUSIVELY
ADDRESSED TO HERSELF--SO DISGUSTINGLY DECORATED WITH A "DEAR MISS
WOODHOUSE." THE CHANGE ON MRS. ELTON'S SIDE SOON AFTERWARDS APPEARED,
AND SHE WAS LEFT IN PEACE--NEITHER FORCED TO BE THE VERY PARTICULAR
FRIEND OF MRS. ELTON, NOR, UNDER MRS. ELTON'S GUIDANCE, THE VERY ACTIVE
PATRONESS OF JANE FAIRFAX, AND ONLY SHARING WITH OTHERS IN A GENERAL
WAY, IN KNOWING WHAT WAS FELT, WHAT WAS MEDITATED, WHAT WAS DONE.

SHE LOOKED ON WITH SOME AMUSEMENT.--MISS BATES'S GRATITUDE FOR
MRS. ELTON'S ATTENTIONS TO JANE WAS IN THE FIRST STYLE OF GUILELESS
SIMPLICITY AND WARMTH. SHE WAS QUITE ONE OF HER WORTHIES--THE
MOST AMIABLE, AFFABLE, DELIGHTFUL WOMAN--JUST AS ACCOMPLISHED AND
CONDESCENDING AS MRS. ELTON MEANT TO BE CONSIDERED. EMMA'S ONLY SURPRIZE
WAS THAT JANE FAIRFAX SHOULD ACCEPT THOSE ATTENTIONS AND TOLERATE MRS.
ELTON AS SHE SEEMED TO DO. SHE HEARD OF HER WALKING WITH THE ELTONS,
SITTING WITH THE ELTONS, SPENDING A DAY WITH THE ELTONS! THIS WAS
ASTONISHING!--SHE COULD NOT HAVE BELIEVED IT POSSIBLE THAT THE TASTE OR
THE PRIDE OF MISS FAIRFAX COULD ENDURE SUCH SOCIETY AND FRIENDSHIP AS
THE VICARAGE HAD TO OFFER.

"SHE IS A RIDDLE, QUITE A RIDDLE!" SAID SHE.--"TO CHUSE TO REMAIN HERE
MONTH AFTER MONTH, UNDER PRIVATIONS OF EVERY SORT! AND NOW TO CHUSE THE
MORTIFICATION OF MRS. ELTON'S NOTICE AND THE PENURY OF HER CONVERSATION,
RATHER THAN RETURN TO THE SUPERIOR COMPANIONS WHO HAVE ALWAYS LOVED HER
WITH SUCH REAL, GENEROUS AFFECTION."

JANE HAD COME TO HIGHBURY PROFESSEDLY FOR THREE MONTHS; THE CAMPBELLS
WERE GONE TO IRELAND FOR THREE MONTHS; BUT NOW THE CAMPBELLS HAD
PROMISED THEIR DAUGHTER TO STAY AT LEAST TILL MIDSUMMER, AND FRESH
INVITATIONS HAD ARRIVED FOR HER TO JOIN THEM THERE. ACCORDING TO MISS
BATES--IT ALL CAME FROM HER--MRS. DIXON HAD WRITTEN MOST PRESSINGLY.
WOULD JANE BUT GO, MEANS WERE TO BE FOUND, SERVANTS SENT, FRIENDS
CONTRIVED--NO TRAVELLING DIFFICULTY ALLOWED TO EXIST; BUT STILL SHE HAD
DECLINED IT!

"SHE MUST HAVE SOME MOTIVE, MORE POWERFUL THAN APPEARS, FOR REFUSING
THIS INVITATION," WAS EMMA'S CONCLUSION. "SHE MUST BE UNDER SOME SORT
OF PENANCE, INFLICTED EITHER BY THE CAMPBELLS OR HERSELF. THERE IS GREAT
FEAR, GREAT CAUTION, GREAT RESOLUTION SOMEWHERE.--SHE IS NOT TO BE
WITH THE DIXONS. THE DECREE IS ISSUED BY SOMEBODY. BUT WHY MUST SHE
CONSENT TO BE WITH THE ELTONS?--HERE IS QUITE A SEPARATE PUZZLE."

UPON HER SPEAKING HER WONDER ALOUD ON THAT PART OF THE SUBJECT, BEFORE
THE FEW WHO KNEW HER OPINION OF MRS. ELTON, MRS. WESTON VENTURED THIS
APOLOGY FOR JANE.

"WE CANNOT SUPPOSE THAT SHE HAS ANY GREAT ENJOYMENT AT THE VICARAGE,
MY DEAR EMMA--BUT IT IS BETTER THAN BEING ALWAYS AT HOME. HER AUNT IS A
GOOD CREATURE, BUT, AS A CONSTANT COMPANION, MUST BE VERY TIRESOME. WE
MUST CONSIDER WHAT MISS FAIRFAX QUITS, BEFORE WE CONDEMN HER TASTE FOR
WHAT SHE GOES TO."

"YOU ARE RIGHT, MRS. WESTON," SAID MR. KNIGHTLEY WARMLY, "MISS FAIRFAX
IS AS CAPABLE AS ANY OF US OF FORMING A JUST OPINION OF MRS. ELTON.
COULD SHE HAVE CHOSEN WITH WHOM TO ASSOCIATE, SHE WOULD NOT HAVE CHOSEN
HER. BUT (WITH A REPROACHFUL SMILE AT EMMA) SHE RECEIVES ATTENTIONS FROM
MRS. ELTON, WHICH NOBODY ELSE PAYS HER."

EMMA FELT THAT MRS. WESTON WAS GIVING HER A MOMENTARY GLANCE; AND SHE
WAS HERSELF STRUCK BY HIS WARMTH. WITH A FAINT BLUSH, SHE PRESENTLY
REPLIED,

"SUCH ATTENTIONS AS MRS. ELTON'S, I SHOULD HAVE IMAGINED, WOULD RATHER
DISGUST THAN GRATIFY MISS FAIRFAX. MRS. ELTON'S INVITATIONS I SHOULD
HAVE IMAGINED ANY THING BUT INVITING."

"I SHOULD NOT WONDER," SAID MRS. WESTON, "IF MISS FAIRFAX WERE TO HAVE
BEEN DRAWN ON BEYOND HER OWN INCLINATION, BY HER AUNT'S EAGERNESS IN
ACCEPTING MRS. ELTON'S CIVILITIES FOR HER. POOR MISS BATES MAY
VERY LIKELY HAVE COMMITTED HER NIECE AND HURRIED HER INTO A GREATER
APPEARANCE OF INTIMACY THAN HER OWN GOOD SENSE WOULD HAVE DICTATED, IN
SPITE OF THE VERY NATURAL WISH OF A LITTLE CHANGE."

BOTH FELT RATHER ANXIOUS TO HEAR HIM SPEAK AGAIN; AND AFTER A FEW
MINUTES SILENCE, HE SAID,

"ANOTHER THING MUST BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION TOO--MRS. ELTON DOES
NOT TALK TO MISS FAIRFAX AS SHE SPEAKS OF HER. WE ALL KNOW THE
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PRONOUNS HE OR SHE AND THOU, THE PLAINEST SPOKEN
AMONGST US; WE ALL FEEL THE INFLUENCE OF A SOMETHING BEYOND COMMON
CIVILITY IN OUR PERSONAL INTERCOURSE WITH EACH OTHER--A SOMETHING MORE
EARLY IMPLANTED. WE CANNOT GIVE ANY BODY THE DISAGREEABLE HINTS THAT WE
MAY HAVE BEEN VERY FULL OF THE HOUR BEFORE. WE FEEL THINGS DIFFERENTLY.
AND BESIDES THE OPERATION OF THIS, AS A GENERAL PRINCIPLE, YOU MAY BE
SURE THAT MISS FAIRFAX AWES MRS. ELTON BY HER SUPERIORITY BOTH OF MIND
AND MANNER; AND THAT, FACE TO FACE, MRS. ELTON TREATS HER WITH ALL THE
RESPECT WHICH SHE HAS A CLAIM TO. SUCH A WOMAN AS JANE FAIRFAX PROBABLY
NEVER FELL IN MRS. ELTON'S WAY BEFORE--AND NO DEGREE OF VANITY CAN
PREVENT HER ACKNOWLEDGING HER OWN COMPARATIVE LITTLENESS IN ACTION, IF
NOT IN CONSCIOUSNESS."

"I KNOW HOW HIGHLY YOU THINK OF JANE FAIRFAX," SAID EMMA. LITTLE HENRY
WAS IN HER THOUGHTS, AND A MIXTURE OF ALARM AND DELICACY MADE HER
IRRESOLUTE WHAT ELSE TO SAY.

"YES," HE REPLIED, "ANY BODY MAY KNOW HOW HIGHLY I THINK OF HER."

"AND YET," SAID EMMA, BEGINNING HASTILY AND WITH AN ARCH LOOK, BUT SOON
STOPPING--IT WAS BETTER, HOWEVER, TO KNOW THE WORST AT ONCE--SHE HURRIED
ON--"AND YET, PERHAPS, YOU MAY HARDLY BE AWARE YOURSELF HOW HIGHLY IT
IS. THE EXTENT OF YOUR ADMIRATION MAY TAKE YOU BY SURPRIZE SOME DAY OR
OTHER."

MR. KNIGHTLEY WAS HARD AT WORK UPON THE LOWER BUTTONS OF HIS THICK
LEATHER GAITERS, AND EITHER THE EXERTION OF GETTING THEM TOGETHER, OR
SOME OTHER CAUSE, BROUGHT THE COLOUR INTO HIS FACE, AS HE ANSWERED,

"OH! ARE YOU THERE?--BUT YOU ARE MISERABLY BEHINDHAND. MR. COLE GAVE ME
A HINT OF IT SIX WEEKS AGO."

HE STOPPED.--EMMA FELT HER FOOT PRESSED BY MRS. WESTON, AND DID NOT
HERSELF KNOW WHAT TO THINK. IN A MOMENT HE WENT ON--

"THAT WILL NEVER BE, HOWEVER, I CAN ASSURE YOU. MISS FAIRFAX, I DARE
SAY, WOULD NOT HAVE ME IF I WERE TO ASK HER--AND I AM VERY SURE I SHALL
NEVER ASK HER."

EMMA RETURNED HER FRIEND'S PRESSURE WITH INTEREST; AND WAS PLEASED
ENOUGH TO EXCLAIM,

"YOU ARE NOT VAIN, MR. KNIGHTLEY. I WILL SAY THAT FOR YOU."

HE SEEMED HARDLY TO HEAR HER; HE WAS THOUGHTFUL--AND IN A MANNER WHICH
SHEWED HIM NOT PLEASED, SOON AFTERWARDS SAID,

"SO YOU HAVE BEEN SETTLING THAT I SHOULD MARRY JANE FAIRFAX?"

"NO INDEED I HAVE NOT. YOU HAVE SCOLDED ME TOO MUCH FOR MATCH-MAKING,
FOR ME TO PRESUME TO TAKE SUCH A LIBERTY WITH YOU. WHAT I SAID JUST NOW,
MEANT NOTHING. ONE SAYS THOSE SORT OF THINGS, OF COURSE, WITHOUT ANY
IDEA OF A SERIOUS MEANING. OH! NO, UPON MY WORD I HAVE NOT THE SMALLEST
WISH FOR YOUR MARRYING JANE FAIRFAX OR JANE ANY BODY. YOU WOULD NOT COME
IN AND SIT WITH US IN THIS COMFORTABLE WAY, IF YOU WERE MARRIED."

MR. KNIGHTLEY WAS THOUGHTFUL AGAIN. THE RESULT OF HIS REVERIE WAS, "NO,
EMMA, I DO NOT THINK THE EXTENT OF MY ADMIRATION FOR HER WILL EVER TAKE
ME BY SURPRIZE.--I NEVER HAD A THOUGHT OF HER IN THAT WAY, I ASSURE
YOU." AND SOON AFTERWARDS, "JANE FAIRFAX IS A VERY CHARMING YOUNG
WOMAN--BUT NOT EVEN JANE FAIRFAX IS PERFECT. SHE HAS A FAULT. SHE HAS
NOT THE OPEN TEMPER WHICH A MAN WOULD WISH FOR IN A WIFE."

EMMA COULD NOT BUT REJOICE TO HEAR THAT SHE HAD A FAULT. "WELL," SAID
SHE, "AND YOU SOON SILENCED MR. COLE, I SUPPOSE?"

"YES, VERY SOON. HE GAVE ME A QUIET HINT; I TOLD HIM HE WAS MISTAKEN;
HE ASKED MY PARDON AND SAID NO MORE. COLE DOES NOT WANT TO BE WISER OR
WITTIER THAN HIS NEIGHBOURS."

"IN THAT RESPECT HOW UNLIKE DEAR MRS. ELTON, WHO WANTS TO BE WISER AND
WITTIER THAN ALL THE WORLD! I WONDER HOW SHE SPEAKS OF THE COLES--WHAT
SHE CALLS THEM! HOW CAN SHE FIND ANY APPELLATION FOR THEM, DEEP ENOUGH
IN FAMILIAR VULGARITY? SHE CALLS YOU, KNIGHTLEY--WHAT CAN SHE DO FOR
MR. COLE? AND SO I AM NOT TO BE SURPRIZED THAT JANE FAIRFAX ACCEPTS
HER CIVILITIES AND CONSENTS TO BE WITH HER. MRS. WESTON, YOUR ARGUMENT
WEIGHS MOST WITH ME. I CAN MUCH MORE READILY ENTER INTO THE TEMPTATION
OF GETTING AWAY FROM MISS BATES, THAN I CAN BELIEVE IN THE TRIUMPH OF
MISS FAIRFAX'S MIND OVER MRS. ELTON. I HAVE NO FAITH IN MRS. ELTON'S
ACKNOWLEDGING HERSELF THE INFERIOR IN THOUGHT, WORD, OR DEED; OR IN HER
BEING UNDER ANY RESTRAINT BEYOND HER OWN SCANTY RULE OF GOOD-BREEDING.
I CANNOT IMAGINE THAT SHE WILL NOT BE CONTINUALLY INSULTING HER VISITOR
WITH PRAISE, ENCOURAGEMENT, AND OFFERS OF SERVICE; THAT SHE WILL NOT BE
CONTINUALLY DETAILING HER MAGNIFICENT INTENTIONS, FROM THE PROCURING HER
A PERMANENT SITUATION TO THE INCLUDING HER IN THOSE DELIGHTFUL EXPLORING
PARTIES WHICH ARE TO TAKE PLACE IN THE BAROUCHE-LANDAU."

"JANE FAIRFAX HAS FEELING," SAID MR. KNIGHTLEY--"I DO NOT ACCUSE HER
OF WANT OF FEELING. HER SENSIBILITIES, I SUSPECT, ARE STRONG--AND HER
TEMPER EXCELLENT IN ITS POWER OF FORBEARANCE, PATIENCE, SELF-CONTROL;
BUT IT WANTS OPENNESS. SHE IS RESERVED, MORE RESERVED, I THINK, THAN
SHE USED TO BE--AND I LOVE AN OPEN TEMPER. NO--TILL COLE ALLUDED TO MY
SUPPOSED ATTACHMENT, IT HAD NEVER ENTERED MY HEAD. I SAW JANE FAIRFAX
AND CONVERSED WITH HER, WITH ADMIRATION AND PLEASURE ALWAYS--BUT WITH NO
THOUGHT BEYOND."

"WELL, MRS. WESTON," SAID EMMA TRIUMPHANTLY WHEN HE LEFT THEM, "WHAT DO
YOU SAY NOW TO MR. KNIGHTLEY'S MARRYING JANE FAIRFAX?"

"WHY, REALLY, DEAR EMMA, I SAY THAT HE IS SO VERY MUCH OCCUPIED BY THE
IDEA OF NOT BEING IN LOVE WITH HER, THAT I SHOULD NOT WONDER IF IT
WERE TO END IN HIS BEING SO AT LAST. DO NOT BEAT ME."



CHAPTER XVI


EVERY BODY IN AND ABOUT HIGHBURY WHO HAD EVER VISITED MR. ELTON, WAS
DISPOSED TO PAY HIM ATTENTION ON HIS MARRIAGE. DINNER-PARTIES AND
EVENING-PARTIES WERE MADE FOR HIM AND HIS LADY; AND INVITATIONS FLOWED
IN SO FAST THAT SHE HAD SOON THE PLEASURE OF APPREHENDING THEY WERE
NEVER TO HAVE A DISENGAGED DAY.

"I SEE HOW IT IS," SAID SHE. "I SEE WHAT A LIFE I AM TO LEAD AMONG YOU.
UPON MY WORD WE SHALL BE ABSOLUTELY DISSIPATED. WE REALLY SEEM QUITE
THE FASHION. IF THIS IS LIVING IN THE COUNTRY, IT IS NOTHING VERY
FORMIDABLE. FROM MONDAY NEXT TO SATURDAY, I ASSURE YOU WE HAVE NOT A
DISENGAGED DAY!--A WOMAN WITH FEWER RESOURCES THAN I HAVE, NEED NOT HAVE
BEEN AT A LOSS."

NO INVITATION CAME AMISS TO HER. HER BATH HABITS MADE EVENING-PARTIES
PERFECTLY NATURAL TO HER, AND MAPLE GROVE HAD GIVEN HER A TASTE FOR
DINNERS. SHE WAS A LITTLE SHOCKED AT THE WANT OF TWO DRAWING ROOMS, AT
THE POOR ATTEMPT AT ROUT-CAKES, AND THERE BEING NO ICE IN THE HIGHBURY
CARD-PARTIES. MRS. BATES, MRS. PERRY, MRS. GODDARD AND OTHERS, WERE A
GOOD DEAL BEHIND-HAND IN KNOWLEDGE OF THE WORLD, BUT SHE WOULD SOON SHEW
THEM HOW EVERY THING OUGHT TO BE ARRANGED. IN THE COURSE OF THE SPRING
SHE MUST RETURN THEIR CIVILITIES BY ONE VERY SUPERIOR PARTY--IN WHICH
HER CARD-TABLES SHOULD BE SET OUT WITH THEIR SEPARATE CANDLES AND
UNBROKEN PACKS IN THE TRUE STYLE--AND MORE WAITERS ENGAGED FOR THE
EVENING THAN THEIR OWN ESTABLISHMENT COULD FURNISH, TO CARRY ROUND THE
REFRESHMENTS AT EXACTLY THE PROPER HOUR, AND IN THE PROPER ORDER.

EMMA, IN THE MEANWHILE, COULD NOT BE SATISFIED WITHOUT A DINNER AT
HARTFIELD FOR THE ELTONS. THEY MUST NOT DO LESS THAN OTHERS, OR SHE
SHOULD BE EXPOSED TO ODIOUS SUSPICIONS, AND IMAGINED CAPABLE OF PITIFUL
RESENTMENT. A DINNER THERE MUST BE. AFTER EMMA HAD TALKED ABOUT IT FOR
TEN MINUTES, MR. WOODHOUSE FELT NO UNWILLINGNESS, AND ONLY MADE THE
USUAL STIPULATION OF NOT SITTING AT THE BOTTOM OF THE TABLE HIMSELF,
WITH THE USUAL REGULAR DIFFICULTY OF DECIDING WHO SHOULD DO IT FOR HIM.

THE PERSONS TO BE INVITED, REQUIRED LITTLE THOUGHT. BESIDES THE
ELTONS, IT MUST BE THE WESTONS AND MR. KNIGHTLEY; SO FAR IT WAS ALL OF
COURSE--AND IT WAS HARDLY LESS INEVITABLE THAT POOR LITTLE HARRIET MUST
BE ASKED TO MAKE THE EIGHTH:--BUT THIS INVITATION WAS NOT GIVEN WITH
EQUAL SATISFACTION, AND ON MANY ACCOUNTS EMMA WAS PARTICULARLY PLEASED
BY HARRIET'S BEGGING TO BE ALLOWED TO DECLINE IT. "SHE WOULD RATHER NOT
BE IN HIS COMPANY MORE THAN SHE COULD HELP. SHE WAS NOT YET QUITE
ABLE TO SEE HIM AND HIS CHARMING HAPPY WIFE TOGETHER, WITHOUT FEELING
UNCOMFORTABLE. IF MISS WOODHOUSE WOULD NOT BE DISPLEASED, SHE WOULD
RATHER STAY AT HOME." IT WAS PRECISELY WHAT EMMA WOULD HAVE WISHED, HAD
SHE DEEMED IT POSSIBLE ENOUGH FOR WISHING. SHE WAS DELIGHTED WITH THE
FORTITUDE OF HER LITTLE FRIEND--FOR FORTITUDE SHE KNEW IT WAS IN HER TO
GIVE UP BEING IN COMPANY AND STAY AT HOME; AND SHE COULD NOW INVITE THE
VERY PERSON WHOM SHE REALLY WANTED TO MAKE THE EIGHTH, JANE FAIRFAX.--
SINCE HER LAST CONVERSATION WITH MRS. WESTON AND MR. KNIGHTLEY, SHE
WAS MORE CONSCIENCE-STRICKEN ABOUT JANE FAIRFAX THAN SHE HAD OFTEN
BEEN.--MR. KNIGHTLEY'S WORDS DWELT WITH HER. HE HAD SAID THAT JANE
FAIRFAX RECEIVED ATTENTIONS FROM MRS. ELTON WHICH NOBODY ELSE PAID HER.

"THIS IS VERY TRUE," SAID SHE, "AT LEAST AS FAR AS RELATES TO ME, WHICH
WAS ALL THAT WAS MEANT--AND IT IS VERY SHAMEFUL.--OF THE SAME AGE--AND
ALWAYS KNOWING HER--I OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN MORE HER FRIEND.--SHE WILL
NEVER LIKE ME NOW. I HAVE NEGLECTED HER TOO LONG. BUT I WILL SHEW HER
GREATER ATTENTION THAN I HAVE DONE."

EVERY INVITATION WAS SUCCESSFUL. THEY WERE ALL DISENGAGED AND ALL
HAPPY.--THE PREPARATORY INTEREST OF THIS DINNER, HOWEVER, WAS NOT YET
OVER. A CIRCUMSTANCE RATHER UNLUCKY OCCURRED. THE TWO ELDEST LITTLE
KNIGHTLEYS WERE ENGAGED TO PAY THEIR GRANDPAPA AND AUNT A VISIT OF SOME
WEEKS IN THE SPRING, AND THEIR PAPA NOW PROPOSED BRINGING THEM, AND
STAYING ONE WHOLE DAY AT HARTFIELD--WHICH ONE DAY WOULD BE THE VERY DAY
OF THIS PARTY.--HIS PROFESSIONAL ENGAGEMENTS DID NOT ALLOW OF HIS BEING
PUT OFF, BUT BOTH FATHER AND DAUGHTER WERE DISTURBED BY ITS HAPPENING
SO. MR. WOODHOUSE CONSIDERED EIGHT PERSONS AT DINNER TOGETHER AS THE
UTMOST THAT HIS NERVES COULD BEAR--AND HERE WOULD BE A NINTH--AND EMMA
APPREHENDED THAT IT WOULD BE A NINTH VERY MUCH OUT OF HUMOUR AT NOT
BEING ABLE TO COME EVEN TO HARTFIELD FOR FORTY-EIGHT HOURS WITHOUT
FALLING IN WITH A DINNER-PARTY.

SHE COMFORTED HER FATHER BETTER THAN SHE COULD COMFORT HERSELF, BY
REPRESENTING THAT THOUGH HE CERTAINLY WOULD MAKE THEM NINE, YET
HE ALWAYS SAID SO LITTLE, THAT THE INCREASE OF NOISE WOULD BE VERY
IMMATERIAL. SHE THOUGHT IT IN REALITY A SAD EXCHANGE FOR HERSELF, TO
HAVE HIM WITH HIS GRAVE LOOKS AND RELUCTANT CONVERSATION OPPOSED TO HER
INSTEAD OF HIS BROTHER.

THE EVENT WAS MORE FAVOURABLE TO MR. WOODHOUSE THAN TO EMMA. JOHN
KNIGHTLEY CAME; BUT MR. WESTON WAS UNEXPECTEDLY SUMMONED TO TOWN AND
MUST BE ABSENT ON THE VERY DAY. HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO JOIN THEM IN THE
EVENING, BUT CERTAINLY NOT TO DINNER. MR. WOODHOUSE WAS QUITE AT EASE;
AND THE SEEING HIM SO, WITH THE ARRIVAL OF THE LITTLE BOYS AND THE
PHILOSOPHIC COMPOSURE OF HER BROTHER ON HEARING HIS FATE, REMOVED THE
CHIEF OF EVEN EMMA'S VEXATION.

THE DAY CAME, THE PARTY WERE PUNCTUALLY ASSEMBLED, AND MR. JOHN
KNIGHTLEY SEEMED EARLY TO DEVOTE HIMSELF TO THE BUSINESS OF BEING
AGREEABLE. INSTEAD OF DRAWING HIS BROTHER OFF TO A WINDOW WHILE THEY
WAITED FOR DINNER, HE WAS TALKING TO MISS FAIRFAX. MRS. ELTON,
AS ELEGANT AS LACE AND PEARLS COULD MAKE HER, HE LOOKED AT IN
SILENCE--WANTING ONLY TO OBSERVE ENOUGH FOR ISABELLA'S INFORMATION--BUT
MISS FAIRFAX WAS AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE AND A QUIET GIRL, AND HE COULD TALK
TO HER. HE HAD MET HER BEFORE BREAKFAST AS HE WAS RETURNING FROM A WALK
WITH HIS LITTLE BOYS, WHEN IT HAD BEEN JUST BEGINNING TO RAIN. IT WAS
NATURAL TO HAVE SOME CIVIL HOPES ON THE SUBJECT, AND HE SAID,

"I HOPE YOU DID NOT VENTURE FAR, MISS FAIRFAX, THIS MORNING, OR I AM
SURE YOU MUST HAVE BEEN WET.--WE SCARCELY GOT HOME IN TIME. I HOPE YOU
TURNED DIRECTLY."

"I WENT ONLY TO THE POST-OFFICE," SAID SHE, "AND REACHED HOME BEFORE THE
RAIN WAS MUCH. IT IS MY DAILY ERRAND. I ALWAYS FETCH THE LETTERS WHEN
I AM HERE. IT SAVES TROUBLE, AND IS A SOMETHING TO GET ME OUT. A WALK
BEFORE BREAKFAST DOES ME GOOD."

"NOT A WALK IN THE RAIN, I SHOULD IMAGINE."

"NO, BUT IT DID NOT ABSOLUTELY RAIN WHEN I SET OUT."

MR. JOHN KNIGHTLEY SMILED, AND REPLIED,

"THAT IS TO SAY, YOU CHOSE TO HAVE YOUR WALK, FOR YOU WERE NOT SIX YARDS
FROM YOUR OWN DOOR WHEN I HAD THE PLEASURE OF MEETING YOU; AND HENRY
AND JOHN HAD SEEN MORE DROPS THAN THEY COULD COUNT LONG BEFORE. THE
POST-OFFICE HAS A GREAT CHARM AT ONE PERIOD OF OUR LIVES. WHEN YOU HAVE
LIVED TO MY AGE, YOU WILL BEGIN TO THINK LETTERS ARE NEVER WORTH GOING
THROUGH THE RAIN FOR."

THERE WAS A LITTLE BLUSH, AND THEN THIS ANSWER,

"I MUST NOT HOPE TO BE EVER SITUATED AS YOU ARE, IN THE MIDST OF EVERY
DEAREST CONNEXION, AND THEREFORE I CANNOT EXPECT THAT SIMPLY GROWING
OLDER SHOULD MAKE ME INDIFFERENT ABOUT LETTERS."

"INDIFFERENT! OH! NO--I NEVER CONCEIVED YOU COULD BECOME INDIFFERENT.
LETTERS ARE NO MATTER OF INDIFFERENCE; THEY ARE GENERALLY A VERY
POSITIVE CURSE."

"YOU ARE SPEAKING OF LETTERS OF BUSINESS; MINE ARE LETTERS OF
FRIENDSHIP."

"I HAVE OFTEN THOUGHT THEM THE WORST OF THE TWO," REPLIED HE COOLLY.
"BUSINESS, YOU KNOW, MAY BRING MONEY, BUT FRIENDSHIP HARDLY EVER DOES."

"AH! YOU ARE NOT SERIOUS NOW. I KNOW MR. JOHN KNIGHTLEY TOO WELL--I AM
VERY SURE HE UNDERSTANDS THE VALUE OF FRIENDSHIP AS WELL AS ANY BODY. I
CAN EASILY BELIEVE THAT LETTERS ARE VERY LITTLE TO YOU, MUCH LESS THAN
TO ME, BUT IT IS NOT YOUR BEING TEN YEARS OLDER THAN MYSELF WHICH
MAKES THE DIFFERENCE, IT IS NOT AGE, BUT SITUATION. YOU HAVE EVERY
BODY DEAREST TO YOU ALWAYS AT HAND, I, PROBABLY, NEVER SHALL AGAIN;
AND THEREFORE TILL I HAVE OUTLIVED ALL MY AFFECTIONS, A POST-OFFICE,
I THINK, MUST ALWAYS HAVE POWER TO DRAW ME OUT, IN WORSE WEATHER THAN
TO-DAY."

"WHEN I TALKED OF YOUR BEING ALTERED BY TIME, BY THE PROGRESS OF YEARS,"
SAID JOHN KNIGHTLEY, "I MEANT TO IMPLY THE CHANGE OF SITUATION WHICH
TIME USUALLY BRINGS. I CONSIDER ONE AS INCLUDING THE OTHER. TIME WILL
GENERALLY LESSEN THE INTEREST OF EVERY ATTACHMENT NOT WITHIN THE DAILY
CIRCLE--BUT THAT IS NOT THE CHANGE I HAD IN VIEW FOR YOU. AS AN OLD
FRIEND, YOU WILL ALLOW ME TO HOPE, MISS FAIRFAX, THAT TEN YEARS HENCE
YOU MAY HAVE AS MANY CONCENTRATED OBJECTS AS I HAVE."

IT WAS KINDLY SAID, AND VERY FAR FROM GIVING OFFENCE. A PLEASANT "THANK
YOU" SEEMED MEANT TO LAUGH IT OFF, BUT A BLUSH, A QUIVERING LIP, A TEAR
IN THE EYE, SHEWED THAT IT WAS FELT BEYOND A LAUGH. HER ATTENTION WAS
NOW CLAIMED BY MR. WOODHOUSE, WHO BEING, ACCORDING TO HIS CUSTOM ON SUCH
OCCASIONS, MAKING THE CIRCLE OF HIS GUESTS, AND PAYING HIS PARTICULAR
COMPLIMENTS TO THE LADIES, WAS ENDING WITH HER--AND WITH ALL HIS MILDEST
URBANITY, SAID,

"I AM VERY SORRY TO HEAR, MISS FAIRFAX, OF YOUR BEING OUT THIS MORNING
IN THE RAIN. YOUNG LADIES SHOULD TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES.--YOUNG LADIES
ARE DELICATE PLANTS. THEY SHOULD TAKE CARE OF THEIR HEALTH AND THEIR
COMPLEXION. MY DEAR, DID YOU CHANGE YOUR STOCKINGS?"

"YES, SIR, I DID INDEED; AND I AM VERY MUCH OBLIGED BY YOUR KIND
SOLICITUDE ABOUT ME."

"MY DEAR MISS FAIRFAX, YOUNG LADIES ARE VERY SURE TO BE CARED FOR.--I
HOPE YOUR GOOD GRAND-MAMA AND AUNT ARE WELL. THEY ARE SOME OF MY VERY
OLD FRIENDS. I WISH MY HEALTH ALLOWED ME TO BE A BETTER NEIGHBOUR. YOU
DO US A GREAT DEAL OF HONOUR TO-DAY, I AM SURE. MY DAUGHTER AND I
ARE BOTH HIGHLY SENSIBLE OF YOUR GOODNESS, AND HAVE THE GREATEST
SATISFACTION IN SEEING YOU AT HARTFIELD."

THE KIND-HEARTED, POLITE OLD MAN MIGHT THEN SIT DOWN AND FEEL THAT HE
HAD DONE HIS DUTY, AND MADE EVERY FAIR LADY WELCOME AND EASY.

BY THIS TIME, THE WALK IN THE RAIN HAD REACHED MRS. ELTON, AND HER
REMONSTRANCES NOW OPENED UPON JANE.

"MY DEAR JANE, WHAT IS THIS I HEAR?--GOING TO THE POST-OFFICE IN THE
RAIN!--THIS MUST NOT BE, I ASSURE YOU.--YOU SAD GIRL, HOW COULD YOU DO
SUCH A THING?--IT IS A SIGN I WAS NOT THERE TO TAKE CARE OF YOU."

JANE VERY PATIENTLY ASSURED HER THAT SHE HAD NOT CAUGHT ANY COLD.

"OH! DO NOT TELL ME. YOU REALLY ARE A VERY SAD GIRL, AND DO NOT KNOW
HOW TO TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF.--TO THE POST-OFFICE INDEED! MRS. WESTON,
DID YOU EVER HEAR THE LIKE? YOU AND I MUST POSITIVELY EXERT OUR
AUTHORITY."

"MY ADVICE," SAID MRS. WESTON KINDLY AND PERSUASIVELY, "I CERTAINLY DO
FEEL TEMPTED TO GIVE. MISS FAIRFAX, YOU MUST NOT RUN SUCH RISKS.--LIABLE
AS YOU HAVE BEEN TO SEVERE COLDS, INDEED YOU OUGHT TO BE PARTICULARLY
CAREFUL, ESPECIALLY AT THIS TIME OF YEAR. THE SPRING I ALWAYS THINK
REQUIRES MORE THAN COMMON CARE. BETTER WAIT AN HOUR OR TWO, OR EVEN
HALF A DAY FOR YOUR LETTERS, THAN RUN THE RISK OF BRINGING ON YOUR COUGH
AGAIN. NOW DO NOT YOU FEEL THAT YOU HAD? YES, I AM SURE YOU ARE MUCH TOO
REASONABLE. YOU LOOK AS IF YOU WOULD NOT DO SUCH A THING AGAIN."

"OH! SHE SHALL NOT DO SUCH A THING AGAIN," EAGERLY REJOINED MRS.
ELTON. "WE WILL NOT ALLOW HER TO DO SUCH A THING AGAIN:"--AND NODDING
SIGNIFICANTLY--"THERE MUST BE SOME ARRANGEMENT MADE, THERE MUST INDEED.
I SHALL SPEAK TO MR. E. THE MAN WHO FETCHES OUR LETTERS EVERY MORNING
(ONE OF OUR MEN, I FORGET HIS NAME) SHALL INQUIRE FOR YOURS TOO AND
BRING THEM TO YOU. THAT WILL OBVIATE ALL DIFFICULTIES YOU KNOW; AND FROM
US I REALLY THINK, MY DEAR JANE, YOU CAN HAVE NO SCRUPLE TO ACCEPT
SUCH AN ACCOMMODATION."

"YOU ARE EXTREMELY KIND," SAID JANE; "BUT I CANNOT GIVE UP MY EARLY
WALK. I AM ADVISED TO BE OUT OF DOORS AS MUCH AS I CAN, I MUST WALK
SOMEWHERE, AND THE POST-OFFICE IS AN OBJECT; AND UPON MY WORD, I HAVE
SCARCELY EVER HAD A BAD MORNING BEFORE."

"MY DEAR JANE, SAY NO MORE ABOUT IT. THE THING IS DETERMINED, THAT IS
(LAUGHING AFFECTEDLY) AS FAR AS I CAN PRESUME TO DETERMINE ANY THING
WITHOUT THE CONCURRENCE OF MY LORD AND MASTER. YOU KNOW, MRS. WESTON,
YOU AND I MUST BE CAUTIOUS HOW WE EXPRESS OURSELVES. BUT I DO FLATTER
MYSELF, MY DEAR JANE, THAT MY INFLUENCE IS NOT ENTIRELY WORN OUT. IF I
MEET WITH NO INSUPERABLE DIFFICULTIES THEREFORE, CONSIDER THAT POINT AS
SETTLED."

"EXCUSE ME," SAID JANE EARNESTLY, "I CANNOT BY ANY MEANS CONSENT TO SUCH
AN ARRANGEMENT, SO NEEDLESSLY TROUBLESOME TO YOUR SERVANT. IF THE ERRAND
WERE NOT A PLEASURE TO ME, IT COULD BE DONE, AS IT ALWAYS IS WHEN I AM
NOT HERE, BY MY GRANDMAMA'S."

"OH! MY DEAR; BUT SO MUCH AS PATTY HAS TO DO!--AND IT IS A KINDNESS TO
EMPLOY OUR MEN."

JANE LOOKED AS IF SHE DID NOT MEAN TO BE CONQUERED; BUT INSTEAD OF
ANSWERING, SHE BEGAN SPEAKING AGAIN TO MR. JOHN KNIGHTLEY.

"THE POST-OFFICE IS A WONDERFUL ESTABLISHMENT!" SAID SHE.--"THE
REGULARITY AND DESPATCH OF IT! IF ONE THINKS OF ALL THAT IT HAS TO DO,
AND ALL THAT IT DOES SO WELL, IT IS REALLY ASTONISHING!"

"IT IS CERTAINLY VERY WELL REGULATED."

"SO SELDOM THAT ANY NEGLIGENCE OR BLUNDER APPEARS! SO SELDOM THAT
A LETTER, AMONG THE THOUSANDS THAT ARE CONSTANTLY PASSING ABOUT THE
KINGDOM, IS EVEN CARRIED WRONG--AND NOT ONE IN A MILLION, I SUPPOSE,
ACTUALLY LOST! AND WHEN ONE CONSIDERS THE VARIETY OF HANDS, AND OF BAD
HANDS TOO, THAT ARE TO BE DECIPHERED, IT INCREASES THE WONDER."

"THE CLERKS GROW EXPERT FROM HABIT.--THEY MUST BEGIN WITH SOME QUICKNESS
OF SIGHT AND HAND, AND EXERCISE IMPROVES THEM. IF YOU WANT ANY FARTHER
EXPLANATION," CONTINUED HE, SMILING, "THEY ARE PAID FOR IT. THAT IS
THE KEY TO A GREAT DEAL OF CAPACITY. THE PUBLIC PAYS AND MUST BE SERVED
WELL."

THE VARIETIES OF HANDWRITING WERE FARTHER TALKED OF, AND THE USUAL
OBSERVATIONS MADE.

"I HAVE HEARD IT ASSERTED," SAID JOHN KNIGHTLEY, "THAT THE SAME SORT
OF HANDWRITING OFTEN PREVAILS IN A FAMILY; AND WHERE THE SAME MASTER
TEACHES, IT IS NATURAL ENOUGH. BUT FOR THAT REASON, I SHOULD IMAGINE
THE LIKENESS MUST BE CHIEFLY CONFINED TO THE FEMALES, FOR BOYS HAVE VERY
LITTLE TEACHING AFTER AN EARLY AGE, AND SCRAMBLE INTO ANY HAND THEY CAN
GET. ISABELLA AND EMMA, I THINK, DO WRITE VERY MUCH ALIKE. I HAVE NOT
ALWAYS KNOWN THEIR WRITING APART."

"YES," SAID HIS BROTHER HESITATINGLY, "THERE IS A LIKENESS. I KNOW WHAT
YOU MEAN--BUT EMMA'S HAND IS THE STRONGEST."

"ISABELLA AND EMMA BOTH WRITE BEAUTIFULLY," SAID MR. WOODHOUSE; "AND
ALWAYS DID. AND SO DOES POOR MRS. WESTON"--WITH HALF A SIGH AND HALF A
SMILE AT HER.

"I NEVER SAW ANY GENTLEMAN'S HANDWRITING"--EMMA BEGAN, LOOKING ALSO AT
MRS. WESTON; BUT STOPPED, ON PERCEIVING THAT MRS. WESTON WAS ATTENDING
TO SOME ONE ELSE--AND THE PAUSE GAVE HER TIME TO REFLECT, "NOW, HOW AM
I GOING TO INTRODUCE HIM?--AM I UNEQUAL TO SPEAKING HIS NAME AT ONCE
BEFORE ALL THESE PEOPLE? IS IT NECESSARY FOR ME TO USE ANY ROUNDABOUT
PHRASE?--YOUR YORKSHIRE FRIEND--YOUR CORRESPONDENT IN YORKSHIRE;--THAT
WOULD BE THE WAY, I SUPPOSE, IF I WERE VERY BAD.--NO, I CAN PRONOUNCE
HIS NAME WITHOUT THE SMALLEST DISTRESS. I CERTAINLY GET BETTER AND
BETTER.--NOW FOR IT."

MRS. WESTON WAS DISENGAGED AND EMMA BEGAN AGAIN--"MR. FRANK CHURCHILL
WRITES ONE OF THE BEST GENTLEMAN'S HANDS I EVER SAW."

"I DO NOT ADMIRE IT," SAID MR. KNIGHTLEY. "IT IS TOO SMALL--WANTS
STRENGTH. IT IS LIKE A WOMAN'S WRITING."

THIS WAS NOT SUBMITTED TO BY EITHER LADY. THEY VINDICATED HIM AGAINST
THE BASE ASPERSION. "NO, IT BY NO MEANS WANTED STRENGTH--IT WAS NOT A
LARGE HAND, BUT VERY CLEAR AND CERTAINLY STRONG. HAD NOT MRS. WESTON ANY
LETTER ABOUT HER TO PRODUCE?" NO, SHE HAD HEARD FROM HIM VERY LATELY,
BUT HAVING ANSWERED THE LETTER, HAD PUT IT AWAY.

"IF WE WERE IN THE OTHER ROOM," SAID EMMA, "IF I HAD MY WRITING-DESK, I
AM SURE I COULD PRODUCE A SPECIMEN. I HAVE A NOTE OF HIS.--DO NOT YOU
REMEMBER, MRS. WESTON, EMPLOYING HIM TO WRITE FOR YOU ONE DAY?"

"HE CHOSE TO SAY HE WAS EMPLOYED"--

"WELL, WELL, I HAVE THAT NOTE; AND CAN SHEW IT AFTER DINNER TO CONVINCE
MR. KNIGHTLEY."

"OH! WHEN A GALLANT YOUNG MAN, LIKE MR. FRANK CHURCHILL," SAID MR.
KNIGHTLEY DRYLY, "WRITES TO A FAIR LADY LIKE MISS WOODHOUSE, HE WILL, OF
COURSE, PUT FORTH HIS BEST."

DINNER WAS ON TABLE.--MRS. ELTON, BEFORE SHE COULD BE SPOKEN TO, WAS
READY; AND BEFORE MR. WOODHOUSE HAD REACHED HER WITH HIS REQUEST TO BE
ALLOWED TO HAND HER INTO THE DINING-PARLOUR, WAS SAYING--

"MUST I GO FIRST? I REALLY AM ASHAMED OF ALWAYS LEADING THE WAY."

JANE'S SOLICITUDE ABOUT FETCHING HER OWN LETTERS HAD NOT ESCAPED EMMA.
SHE HAD HEARD AND SEEN IT ALL; AND FELT SOME CURIOSITY TO KNOW WHETHER
THE WET WALK OF THIS MORNING HAD PRODUCED ANY. SHE SUSPECTED THAT IT
HAD; THAT IT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SO RESOLUTELY ENCOUNTERED BUT IN FULL
EXPECTATION OF HEARING FROM SOME ONE VERY DEAR, AND THAT IT HAD NOT BEEN
IN VAIN. SHE THOUGHT THERE WAS AN AIR OF GREATER HAPPINESS THAN USUAL--A
GLOW BOTH OF COMPLEXION AND SPIRITS.

SHE COULD HAVE MADE AN INQUIRY OR TWO, AS TO THE EXPEDITION AND THE
EXPENSE OF THE IRISH MAILS;--IT WAS AT HER TONGUE'S END--BUT SHE
ABSTAINED. SHE WAS QUITE DETERMINED NOT TO UTTER A WORD THAT SHOULD HURT
JANE FAIRFAX'S FEELINGS; AND THEY FOLLOWED THE OTHER LADIES OUT OF THE
ROOM, ARM IN ARM, WITH AN APPEARANCE OF GOOD-WILL HIGHLY BECOMING TO THE
BEAUTY AND GRACE OF EACH.



CHAPTER XVII


WHEN THE LADIES RETURNED TO THE DRAWING-ROOM AFTER DINNER, EMMA FOUND IT
HARDLY POSSIBLE TO PREVENT THEIR MAKING TWO DISTINCT PARTIES;--WITH SO
MUCH PERSEVERANCE IN JUDGING AND BEHAVING ILL DID MRS. ELTON ENGROSS
JANE FAIRFAX AND SLIGHT HERSELF. SHE AND MRS. WESTON WERE OBLIGED TO
BE ALMOST ALWAYS EITHER TALKING TOGETHER OR SILENT TOGETHER. MRS. ELTON
LEFT THEM NO CHOICE. IF JANE REPRESSED HER FOR A LITTLE TIME, SHE
SOON BEGAN AGAIN; AND THOUGH MUCH THAT PASSED BETWEEN THEM WAS IN A
HALF-WHISPER, ESPECIALLY ON MRS. ELTON'S SIDE, THERE WAS NO AVOIDING
A KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR PRINCIPAL SUBJECTS: THE POST-OFFICE--CATCHING
COLD--FETCHING LETTERS--AND FRIENDSHIP, WERE LONG UNDER DISCUSSION;
AND TO THEM SUCCEEDED ONE, WHICH MUST BE AT LEAST EQUALLY UNPLEASANT
TO JANE--INQUIRIES WHETHER SHE HAD YET HEARD OF ANY SITUATION LIKELY TO
SUIT HER, AND PROFESSIONS OF MRS. ELTON'S MEDITATED ACTIVITY.

"HERE IS APRIL COME!" SAID SHE, "I GET QUITE ANXIOUS ABOUT YOU. JUNE
WILL SOON BE HERE."

"BUT I HAVE NEVER FIXED ON JUNE OR ANY OTHER MONTH--MERELY LOOKED
FORWARD TO THE SUMMER IN GENERAL."

"BUT HAVE YOU REALLY HEARD OF NOTHING?"

"I HAVE NOT EVEN MADE ANY INQUIRY; I DO NOT WISH TO MAKE ANY YET."

"OH! MY DEAR, WE CANNOT BEGIN TOO EARLY; YOU ARE NOT AWARE OF THE
DIFFICULTY OF PROCURING EXACTLY THE DESIRABLE THING."

"I NOT AWARE!" SAID JANE, SHAKING HER HEAD; "DEAR MRS. ELTON, WHO CAN
HAVE THOUGHT OF IT AS I HAVE DONE?"

"BUT YOU HAVE NOT SEEN SO MUCH OF THE WORLD AS I HAVE. YOU DO NOT KNOW
HOW MANY CANDIDATES THERE ALWAYS ARE FOR THE FIRST SITUATIONS. I SAW
A VAST DEAL OF THAT IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD ROUND MAPLE GROVE. A COUSIN OF
MR. SUCKLING, MRS. BRAGGE, HAD SUCH AN INFINITY OF APPLICATIONS; EVERY
BODY WAS ANXIOUS TO BE IN HER FAMILY, FOR SHE MOVES IN THE FIRST CIRCLE.
WAX-CANDLES IN THE SCHOOLROOM! YOU MAY IMAGINE HOW DESIRABLE! OF ALL
HOUSES IN THE KINGDOM MRS. BRAGGE'S IS THE ONE I WOULD MOST WISH TO SEE
YOU IN."

"COLONEL AND MRS. CAMPBELL ARE TO BE IN TOWN AGAIN BY MIDSUMMER,"
SAID JANE. "I MUST SPEND SOME TIME WITH THEM; I AM SURE THEY WILL WANT
IT;--AFTERWARDS I MAY PROBABLY BE GLAD TO DISPOSE OF MYSELF. BUT I WOULD
NOT WISH YOU TO TAKE THE TROUBLE OF MAKING ANY INQUIRIES AT PRESENT."

"TROUBLE! AYE, I KNOW YOUR SCRUPLES. YOU ARE AFRAID OF GIVING ME
TROUBLE; BUT I ASSURE YOU, MY DEAR JANE, THE CAMPBELLS CAN HARDLY BE
MORE INTERESTED ABOUT YOU THAN I AM. I SHALL WRITE TO MRS. PARTRIDGE IN
A DAY OR TWO, AND SHALL GIVE HER A STRICT CHARGE TO BE ON THE LOOK-OUT
FOR ANY THING ELIGIBLE."

"THANK YOU, BUT I WOULD RATHER YOU DID NOT MENTION THE SUBJECT TO
HER; TILL THE TIME DRAWS NEARER, I DO NOT WISH TO BE GIVING ANY BODY
TROUBLE."

"BUT, MY DEAR CHILD, THE TIME IS DRAWING NEAR; HERE IS APRIL, AND JUNE,
OR SAY EVEN JULY, IS VERY NEAR, WITH SUCH BUSINESS TO ACCOMPLISH BEFORE
US. YOUR INEXPERIENCE REALLY AMUSES ME! A SITUATION SUCH AS YOU DESERVE,
AND YOUR FRIENDS WOULD REQUIRE FOR YOU, IS NO EVERYDAY OCCURRENCE,
IS NOT OBTAINED AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE; INDEED, INDEED, WE MUST BEGIN
INQUIRING DIRECTLY."

"EXCUSE ME, MA'AM, BUT THIS IS BY NO MEANS MY INTENTION; I MAKE NO
INQUIRY MYSELF, AND SHOULD BE SORRY TO HAVE ANY MADE BY MY FRIENDS. WHEN
I AM QUITE DETERMINED AS TO THE TIME, I AM NOT AT ALL AFRAID OF BEING
LONG UNEMPLOYED. THERE ARE PLACES IN TOWN, OFFICES, WHERE INQUIRY
WOULD SOON PRODUCE SOMETHING--OFFICES FOR THE SALE--NOT QUITE OF HUMAN
FLESH--BUT OF HUMAN INTELLECT."

"OH! MY DEAR, HUMAN FLESH! YOU QUITE SHOCK ME; IF YOU MEAN A FLING AT
THE SLAVE-TRADE, I ASSURE YOU MR. SUCKLING WAS ALWAYS RATHER A FRIEND TO
THE ABOLITION."

"I DID NOT MEAN, I WAS NOT THINKING OF THE SLAVE-TRADE," REPLIED JANE;
"GOVERNESS-TRADE, I ASSURE YOU, WAS ALL THAT I HAD IN VIEW; WIDELY
DIFFERENT CERTAINLY AS TO THE GUILT OF THOSE WHO CARRY IT ON; BUT AS TO
THE GREATER MISERY OF THE VICTIMS, I DO NOT KNOW WHERE IT LIES. BUT
I ONLY MEAN TO SAY THAT THERE ARE ADVERTISING OFFICES, AND THAT BY
APPLYING TO THEM I SHOULD HAVE NO DOUBT OF VERY SOON MEETING WITH
SOMETHING THAT WOULD DO."

"SOMETHING THAT WOULD DO!" REPEATED MRS. ELTON. "AYE, THAT MAY SUIT
YOUR HUMBLE IDEAS OF YOURSELF;--I KNOW WHAT A MODEST CREATURE YOU ARE;
BUT IT WILL NOT SATISFY YOUR FRIENDS TO HAVE YOU TAKING UP WITH ANY
THING THAT MAY OFFER, ANY INFERIOR, COMMONPLACE SITUATION, IN A FAMILY
NOT MOVING IN A CERTAIN CIRCLE, OR ABLE TO COMMAND THE ELEGANCIES OF
LIFE."

"YOU ARE VERY OBLIGING; BUT AS TO ALL THAT, I AM VERY INDIFFERENT;
IT WOULD BE NO OBJECT TO ME TO BE WITH THE RICH; MY MORTIFICATIONS, I
THINK, WOULD ONLY BE THE GREATER; I SHOULD SUFFER MORE FROM COMPARISON.
A GENTLEMAN'S FAMILY IS ALL THAT I SHOULD CONDITION FOR."

"I KNOW YOU, I KNOW YOU; YOU WOULD TAKE UP WITH ANY THING; BUT I SHALL
BE A LITTLE MORE NICE, AND I AM SURE THE GOOD CAMPBELLS WILL BE QUITE
ON MY SIDE; WITH YOUR SUPERIOR TALENTS, YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO MOVE IN THE
FIRST CIRCLE. YOUR MUSICAL KNOWLEDGE ALONE WOULD ENTITLE YOU TO NAME
YOUR OWN TERMS, HAVE AS MANY ROOMS AS YOU LIKE, AND MIX IN THE FAMILY
AS MUCH AS YOU CHOSE;--THAT IS--I DO NOT KNOW--IF YOU KNEW THE HARP, YOU
MIGHT DO ALL THAT, I AM VERY SURE; BUT YOU SING AS WELL AS PLAY;--YES, I
REALLY BELIEVE YOU MIGHT, EVEN WITHOUT THE HARP, STIPULATE FOR WHAT
YOU CHOSE;--AND YOU MUST AND SHALL BE DELIGHTFULLY, HONOURABLY AND
COMFORTABLY SETTLED BEFORE THE CAMPBELLS OR I HAVE ANY REST."

"YOU MAY WELL CLASS THE DELIGHT, THE HONOUR, AND THE COMFORT OF SUCH
A SITUATION TOGETHER," SAID JANE, "THEY ARE PRETTY SURE TO BE EQUAL;
HOWEVER, I AM VERY SERIOUS IN NOT WISHING ANY THING TO BE ATTEMPTED
AT PRESENT FOR ME. I AM EXCEEDINGLY OBLIGED TO YOU, MRS. ELTON, I AM
OBLIGED TO ANY BODY WHO FEELS FOR ME, BUT I AM QUITE SERIOUS IN WISHING
NOTHING TO BE DONE TILL THE SUMMER. FOR TWO OR THREE MONTHS LONGER I
SHALL REMAIN WHERE I AM, AND AS I AM."

"AND I AM QUITE SERIOUS TOO, I ASSURE YOU," REPLIED MRS. ELTON GAILY,
"IN RESOLVING TO BE ALWAYS ON THE WATCH, AND EMPLOYING MY FRIENDS TO
WATCH ALSO, THAT NOTHING REALLY UNEXCEPTIONABLE MAY PASS US."

IN THIS STYLE SHE RAN ON; NEVER THOROUGHLY STOPPED BY ANY THING TILL MR.
WOODHOUSE CAME INTO THE ROOM; HER VANITY HAD THEN A CHANGE OF OBJECT,
AND EMMA HEARD HER SAYING IN THE SAME HALF-WHISPER TO JANE,

"HERE COMES THIS DEAR OLD BEAU OF MINE, I PROTEST!--ONLY THINK OF HIS
GALLANTRY IN COMING AWAY BEFORE THE OTHER MEN!--WHAT A DEAR CREATURE
HE IS;--I ASSURE YOU I LIKE HIM EXCESSIVELY. I ADMIRE ALL THAT QUAINT,
OLD-FASHIONED POLITENESS; IT IS MUCH MORE TO MY TASTE THAN MODERN EASE;
MODERN EASE OFTEN DISGUSTS ME. BUT THIS GOOD OLD MR. WOODHOUSE, I WISH
YOU HAD HEARD HIS GALLANT SPEECHES TO ME AT DINNER. OH! I ASSURE YOU I
BEGAN TO THINK MY CARO SPOSO WOULD BE ABSOLUTELY JEALOUS. I FANCY I
AM RATHER A FAVOURITE; HE TOOK NOTICE OF MY GOWN. HOW DO YOU LIKE
IT?--SELINA'S CHOICE--HANDSOME, I THINK, BUT I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER IT
IS NOT OVER-TRIMMED; I HAVE THE GREATEST DISLIKE TO THE IDEA OF BEING
OVER-TRIMMED--QUITE A HORROR OF FINERY. I MUST PUT ON A FEW ORNAMENTS
NOW, BECAUSE IT IS EXPECTED OF ME. A BRIDE, YOU KNOW, MUST APPEAR LIKE
A BRIDE, BUT MY NATURAL TASTE IS ALL FOR SIMPLICITY; A SIMPLE STYLE
OF DRESS IS SO INFINITELY PREFERABLE TO FINERY. BUT I AM QUITE IN THE
MINORITY, I BELIEVE; FEW PEOPLE SEEM TO VALUE SIMPLICITY OF DRESS,--SHOW
AND FINERY ARE EVERY THING. I HAVE SOME NOTION OF PUTTING SUCH A
TRIMMING AS THIS TO MY WHITE AND SILVER POPLIN. DO YOU THINK IT WILL
LOOK WELL?"

THE WHOLE PARTY WERE BUT JUST REASSEMBLED IN THE DRAWING-ROOM WHEN MR.
WESTON MADE HIS APPEARANCE AMONG THEM. HE HAD RETURNED TO A LATE DINNER,
AND WALKED TO HARTFIELD AS SOON AS IT WAS OVER. HE HAD BEEN TOO MUCH
EXPECTED BY THE BEST JUDGES, FOR SURPRIZE--BUT THERE WAS GREAT JOY. MR.
WOODHOUSE WAS ALMOST AS GLAD TO SEE HIM NOW, AS HE WOULD HAVE BEEN SORRY
TO SEE HIM BEFORE. JOHN KNIGHTLEY ONLY WAS IN MUTE ASTONISHMENT.--THAT
A MAN WHO MIGHT HAVE SPENT HIS EVENING QUIETLY AT HOME AFTER A DAY
OF BUSINESS IN LONDON, SHOULD SET OFF AGAIN, AND WALK HALF A MILE
TO ANOTHER MAN'S HOUSE, FOR THE SAKE OF BEING IN MIXED COMPANY TILL
BED-TIME, OF FINISHING HIS DAY IN THE EFFORTS OF CIVILITY AND THE NOISE
OF NUMBERS, WAS A CIRCUMSTANCE TO STRIKE HIM DEEPLY. A MAN WHO HAD BEEN
IN MOTION SINCE EIGHT O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING, AND MIGHT NOW HAVE BEEN
STILL, WHO HAD BEEN LONG TALKING, AND MIGHT HAVE BEEN SILENT, WHO HAD
BEEN IN MORE THAN ONE CROWD, AND MIGHT HAVE BEEN ALONE!--SUCH A MAN, TO
QUIT THE TRANQUILLITY AND INDEPENDENCE OF HIS OWN FIRESIDE, AND ON THE
EVENING OF A COLD SLEETY APRIL DAY RUSH OUT AGAIN INTO THE WORLD!--COULD
HE BY A TOUCH OF HIS FINGER HAVE INSTANTLY TAKEN BACK HIS WIFE, THERE
WOULD HAVE BEEN A MOTIVE; BUT HIS COMING WOULD PROBABLY PROLONG RATHER
THAN BREAK UP THE PARTY. JOHN KNIGHTLEY LOOKED AT HIM WITH AMAZEMENT,
THEN SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS, AND SAID, "I COULD NOT HAVE BELIEVED IT
EVEN OF HIM."

MR. WESTON MEANWHILE, PERFECTLY UNSUSPICIOUS OF THE INDIGNATION HE WAS
EXCITING, HAPPY AND CHEERFUL AS USUAL, AND WITH ALL THE RIGHT OF BEING
PRINCIPAL TALKER, WHICH A DAY SPENT ANYWHERE FROM HOME CONFERS, WAS
MAKING HIMSELF AGREEABLE AMONG THE REST; AND HAVING SATISFIED THE
INQUIRIES OF HIS WIFE AS TO HIS DINNER, CONVINCING HER THAT NONE OF ALL
HER CAREFUL DIRECTIONS TO THE SERVANTS HAD BEEN FORGOTTEN, AND SPREAD
ABROAD WHAT PUBLIC NEWS HE HAD HEARD, WAS PROCEEDING TO A FAMILY
COMMUNICATION, WHICH, THOUGH PRINCIPALLY ADDRESSED TO MRS. WESTON, HE
HAD NOT THE SMALLEST DOUBT OF BEING HIGHLY INTERESTING TO EVERY BODY IN
THE ROOM. HE GAVE HER A LETTER, IT WAS FROM FRANK, AND TO HERSELF; HE
HAD MET WITH IT IN HIS WAY, AND HAD TAKEN THE LIBERTY OF OPENING IT.

"READ IT, READ IT," SAID HE, "IT WILL GIVE YOU PLEASURE; ONLY A FEW
LINES--WILL NOT TAKE YOU LONG; READ IT TO EMMA."

THE TWO LADIES LOOKED OVER IT TOGETHER; AND HE SAT SMILING AND TALKING
TO THEM THE WHOLE TIME, IN A VOICE A LITTLE SUBDUED, BUT VERY AUDIBLE TO
EVERY BODY.

"WELL, HE IS COMING, YOU SEE; GOOD NEWS, I THINK. WELL, WHAT DO YOU SAY
TO IT?--I ALWAYS TOLD YOU HE WOULD BE HERE AGAIN SOON, DID NOT I?--ANNE,
MY DEAR, DID NOT I ALWAYS TELL YOU SO, AND YOU WOULD NOT BELIEVE ME?--IN
TOWN NEXT WEEK, YOU SEE--AT THE LATEST, I DARE SAY; FOR SHE IS AS
IMPATIENT AS THE BLACK GENTLEMAN WHEN ANY THING IS TO BE DONE; MOST
LIKELY THEY WILL BE THERE TO-MORROW OR SATURDAY. AS TO HER ILLNESS, ALL
NOTHING OF COURSE. BUT IT IS AN EXCELLENT THING TO HAVE FRANK AMONG US
AGAIN, SO NEAR AS TOWN. THEY WILL STAY A GOOD WHILE WHEN THEY DO COME,
AND HE WILL BE HALF HIS TIME WITH US. THIS IS PRECISELY WHAT I WANTED.
WELL, PRETTY GOOD NEWS, IS NOT IT? HAVE YOU FINISHED IT? HAS EMMA READ
IT ALL? PUT IT UP, PUT IT UP; WE WILL HAVE A GOOD TALK ABOUT IT SOME
OTHER TIME, BUT IT WILL NOT DO NOW. I SHALL ONLY JUST MENTION THE
CIRCUMSTANCE TO THE OTHERS IN A COMMON WAY."

MRS. WESTON WAS MOST COMFORTABLY PLEASED ON THE OCCASION. HER LOOKS
AND WORDS HAD NOTHING TO RESTRAIN THEM. SHE WAS HAPPY, SHE KNEW SHE WAS
HAPPY, AND KNEW SHE OUGHT TO BE HAPPY. HER CONGRATULATIONS WERE WARM AND
OPEN; BUT EMMA COULD NOT SPEAK SO FLUENTLY. SHE WAS A LITTLE OCCUPIED
IN WEIGHING HER OWN FEELINGS, AND TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE DEGREE OF HER
AGITATION, WHICH SHE RATHER THOUGHT WAS CONSIDERABLE.

MR. WESTON, HOWEVER, TOO EAGER TO BE VERY OBSERVANT, TOO COMMUNICATIVE
TO WANT OTHERS TO TALK, WAS VERY WELL SATISFIED WITH WHAT SHE DID SAY,
AND SOON MOVED AWAY TO MAKE THE REST OF HIS FRIENDS HAPPY BY A PARTIAL
COMMUNICATION OF WHAT THE WHOLE ROOM MUST HAVE OVERHEARD ALREADY.

IT WAS WELL THAT HE TOOK EVERY BODY'S JOY FOR GRANTED, OR HE MIGHT
NOT HAVE THOUGHT EITHER MR. WOODHOUSE OR MR. KNIGHTLEY PARTICULARLY
DELIGHTED. THEY WERE THE FIRST ENTITLED, AFTER MRS. WESTON AND EMMA, TO
BE MADE HAPPY;--FROM THEM HE WOULD HAVE PROCEEDED TO MISS FAIRFAX, BUT
SHE WAS SO DEEP IN CONVERSATION WITH JOHN KNIGHTLEY, THAT IT WOULD HAVE
BEEN TOO POSITIVE AN INTERRUPTION; AND FINDING HIMSELF CLOSE TO MRS.
ELTON, AND HER ATTENTION DISENGAGED, HE NECESSARILY BEGAN ON THE SUBJECT
WITH HER.



CHAPTER XVIII


"I HOPE I SHALL SOON HAVE THE PLEASURE OF INTRODUCING MY SON TO YOU,"
SAID MR. WESTON.

MRS. ELTON, VERY WILLING TO SUPPOSE A PARTICULAR COMPLIMENT INTENDED HER
BY SUCH A HOPE, SMILED MOST GRACIOUSLY.

"YOU HAVE HEARD OF A CERTAIN FRANK CHURCHILL, I PRESUME," HE
CONTINUED--"AND KNOW HIM TO BE MY SON, THOUGH HE DOES NOT BEAR MY NAME."

"OH! YES, AND I SHALL BE VERY HAPPY IN HIS ACQUAINTANCE. I AM SURE MR.
ELTON WILL LOSE NO TIME IN CALLING ON HIM; AND WE SHALL BOTH HAVE GREAT
PLEASURE IN SEEING HIM AT THE VICARAGE."

"YOU ARE VERY OBLIGING.--FRANK WILL BE EXTREMELY HAPPY, I AM SURE.--
HE IS TO BE IN TOWN NEXT WEEK, IF NOT SOONER. WE HAVE NOTICE OF IT IN A
LETTER TO-DAY. I MET THE LETTERS IN MY WAY THIS MORNING, AND SEEING MY
SON'S HAND, PRESUMED TO OPEN IT--THOUGH IT WAS NOT DIRECTED TO ME--IT
WAS TO MRS. WESTON. SHE IS HIS PRINCIPAL CORRESPONDENT, I ASSURE YOU. I
HARDLY EVER GET A LETTER."

"AND SO YOU ABSOLUTELY OPENED WHAT WAS DIRECTED TO HER! OH! MR.
WESTON--(LAUGHING AFFECTEDLY) I MUST PROTEST AGAINST THAT.--A MOST
DANGEROUS PRECEDENT INDEED!--I BEG YOU WILL NOT LET YOUR NEIGHBOURS
FOLLOW YOUR EXAMPLE.--UPON MY WORD, IF THIS IS WHAT I AM TO EXPECT, WE
MARRIED WOMEN MUST BEGIN TO EXERT OURSELVES!--OH! MR. WESTON, I COULD
NOT HAVE BELIEVED IT OF YOU!"

"AYE, WE MEN ARE SAD FELLOWS. YOU MUST TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF, MRS.
ELTON.--THIS LETTER TELLS US--IT IS A SHORT LETTER--WRITTEN IN A HURRY,
MERELY TO GIVE US NOTICE--IT TELLS US THAT THEY ARE ALL COMING UP TO
TOWN DIRECTLY, ON MRS. CHURCHILL'S ACCOUNT--SHE HAS NOT BEEN WELL THE
WHOLE WINTER, AND THINKS ENSCOMBE TOO COLD FOR HER--SO THEY ARE ALL TO
MOVE SOUTHWARD WITHOUT LOSS OF TIME."

"INDEED!--FROM YORKSHIRE, I THINK. ENSCOMBE IS IN YORKSHIRE?"

"YES, THEY ARE ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND NINETY MILES FROM LONDON, A
CONSIDERABLE JOURNEY."

"YES, UPON MY WORD, VERY CONSIDERABLE. SIXTY-FIVE MILES FARTHER THAN
FROM MAPLE GROVE TO LONDON. BUT WHAT IS DISTANCE, MR. WESTON, TO PEOPLE
OF LARGE FORTUNE?--YOU WOULD BE AMAZED TO HEAR HOW MY BROTHER, MR.
SUCKLING, SOMETIMES FLIES ABOUT. YOU WILL HARDLY BELIEVE ME--BUT TWICE
IN ONE WEEK HE AND MR. BRAGGE WENT TO LONDON AND BACK AGAIN WITH FOUR
HORSES."

"THE EVIL OF THE DISTANCE FROM ENSCOMBE," SAID MR. WESTON, "IS, THAT
MRS. CHURCHILL, AS WE UNDERSTAND, HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO LEAVE THE
SOFA FOR A WEEK TOGETHER. IN FRANK'S LAST LETTER SHE COMPLAINED, HE
SAID, OF BEING TOO WEAK TO GET INTO HER CONSERVATORY WITHOUT HAVING
BOTH HIS ARM AND HIS UNCLE'S! THIS, YOU KNOW, SPEAKS A GREAT DEGREE OF
WEAKNESS--BUT NOW SHE IS SO IMPATIENT TO BE IN TOWN, THAT SHE MEANS TO
SLEEP ONLY TWO NIGHTS ON THE ROAD.--SO FRANK WRITES WORD. CERTAINLY,
DELICATE LADIES HAVE VERY EXTRAORDINARY CONSTITUTIONS, MRS. ELTON. YOU
MUST GRANT ME THAT."

"NO, INDEED, I SHALL GRANT YOU NOTHING. I ALWAYS TAKE THE PART OF MY
OWN SEX. I DO INDEED. I GIVE YOU NOTICE--YOU WILL FIND ME A FORMIDABLE
ANTAGONIST ON THAT POINT. I ALWAYS STAND UP FOR WOMEN--AND I ASSURE YOU,
IF YOU KNEW HOW SELINA FEELS WITH RESPECT TO SLEEPING AT AN INN, YOU
WOULD NOT WONDER AT MRS. CHURCHILL'S MAKING INCREDIBLE EXERTIONS TO
AVOID IT. SELINA SAYS IT IS QUITE HORROR TO HER--AND I BELIEVE I HAVE
CAUGHT A LITTLE OF HER NICETY. SHE ALWAYS TRAVELS WITH HER OWN SHEETS;
AN EXCELLENT PRECAUTION. DOES MRS. CHURCHILL DO THE SAME?"

"DEPEND UPON IT, MRS. CHURCHILL DOES EVERY THING THAT ANY OTHER FINE
LADY EVER DID. MRS. CHURCHILL WILL NOT BE SECOND TO ANY LADY IN THE LAND
FOR"--

MRS. ELTON EAGERLY INTERPOSED WITH,

"OH! MR. WESTON, DO NOT MISTAKE ME. SELINA IS NO FINE LADY, I ASSURE
YOU. DO NOT RUN AWAY WITH SUCH AN IDEA."

"IS NOT SHE? THEN SHE IS NO RULE FOR MRS. CHURCHILL, WHO IS AS THOROUGH
A FINE LADY AS ANY BODY EVER BEHELD."

MRS. ELTON BEGAN TO THINK SHE HAD BEEN WRONG IN DISCLAIMING SO WARMLY.
IT WAS BY NO MEANS HER OBJECT TO HAVE IT BELIEVED THAT HER SISTER WAS
NOT A FINE LADY; PERHAPS THERE WAS WANT OF SPIRIT IN THE PRETENCE OF
IT;--AND SHE WAS CONSIDERING IN WHAT WAY SHE HAD BEST RETRACT, WHEN MR.
WESTON WENT ON.

"MRS. CHURCHILL IS NOT MUCH IN MY GOOD GRACES, AS YOU MAY SUSPECT--BUT
THIS IS QUITE BETWEEN OURSELVES. SHE IS VERY FOND OF FRANK, AND
THEREFORE I WOULD NOT SPEAK ILL OF HER. BESIDES, SHE IS OUT OF HEALTH
NOW; BUT THAT INDEED, BY HER OWN ACCOUNT, SHE HAS ALWAYS BEEN. I WOULD
NOT SAY SO TO EVERY BODY, MRS. ELTON, BUT I HAVE NOT MUCH FAITH IN MRS.
CHURCHILL'S ILLNESS."

"IF SHE IS REALLY ILL, WHY NOT GO TO BATH, MR. WESTON?--TO BATH, OR TO
CLIFTON?" "SHE HAS TAKEN IT INTO HER HEAD THAT ENSCOMBE IS TOO COLD FOR
HER. THE FACT IS, I SUPPOSE, THAT SHE IS TIRED OF ENSCOMBE. SHE HAS NOW
BEEN A LONGER TIME STATIONARY THERE, THAN SHE EVER WAS BEFORE, AND SHE
BEGINS TO WANT CHANGE. IT IS A RETIRED PLACE. A FINE PLACE, BUT VERY
RETIRED."

"AYE--LIKE MAPLE GROVE, I DARE SAY. NOTHING CAN STAND MORE RETIRED FROM
THE ROAD THAN MAPLE GROVE. SUCH AN IMMENSE PLANTATION ALL ROUND IT! YOU
SEEM SHUT OUT FROM EVERY THING--IN THE MOST COMPLETE RETIREMENT.--AND
MRS. CHURCHILL PROBABLY HAS NOT HEALTH OR SPIRITS LIKE SELINA TO ENJOY
THAT SORT OF SECLUSION. OR, PERHAPS SHE MAY NOT HAVE RESOURCES ENOUGH IN
HERSELF TO BE QUALIFIED FOR A COUNTRY LIFE. I ALWAYS SAY A WOMAN CANNOT
HAVE TOO MANY RESOURCES--AND I FEEL VERY THANKFUL THAT I HAVE SO MANY
MYSELF AS TO BE QUITE INDEPENDENT OF SOCIETY."

"FRANK WAS HERE IN FEBRUARY FOR A FORTNIGHT."

"SO I REMEMBER TO HAVE HEARD. HE WILL FIND AN ADDITION TO THE SOCIETY
OF HIGHBURY WHEN HE COMES AGAIN; THAT IS, IF I MAY PRESUME TO CALL
MYSELF AN ADDITION. BUT PERHAPS HE MAY NEVER HAVE HEARD OF THERE BEING
SUCH A CREATURE IN THE WORLD."

THIS WAS TOO LOUD A CALL FOR A COMPLIMENT TO BE PASSED BY, AND MR.
WESTON, WITH A VERY GOOD GRACE, IMMEDIATELY EXCLAIMED,

"MY DEAR MADAM! NOBODY BUT YOURSELF COULD IMAGINE SUCH A THING POSSIBLE.
NOT HEARD OF YOU!--I BELIEVE MRS. WESTON'S LETTERS LATELY HAVE BEEN FULL
OF VERY LITTLE ELSE THAN MRS. ELTON."

HE HAD DONE HIS DUTY AND COULD RETURN TO HIS SON.

"WHEN FRANK LEFT US," CONTINUED HE, "IT WAS QUITE UNCERTAIN WHEN WE
MIGHT SEE HIM AGAIN, WHICH MAKES THIS DAY'S NEWS DOUBLY WELCOME. IT HAS
BEEN COMPLETELY UNEXPECTED. THAT IS, I ALWAYS HAD A STRONG PERSUASION
HE WOULD BE HERE AGAIN SOON, I WAS SURE SOMETHING FAVOURABLE WOULD TURN
UP--BUT NOBODY BELIEVED ME. HE AND MRS. WESTON WERE BOTH DREADFULLY
DESPONDING. 'HOW COULD HE CONTRIVE TO COME? AND HOW COULD IT BE SUPPOSED
THAT HIS UNCLE AND AUNT WOULD SPARE HIM AGAIN?' AND SO FORTH--I ALWAYS
FELT THAT SOMETHING WOULD HAPPEN IN OUR FAVOUR; AND SO IT HAS, YOU SEE.
I HAVE OBSERVED, MRS. ELTON, IN THE COURSE OF MY LIFE, THAT IF THINGS
ARE GOING UNTOWARDLY ONE MONTH, THEY ARE SURE TO MEND THE NEXT."

"VERY TRUE, MR. WESTON, PERFECTLY TRUE. IT IS JUST WHAT I USED TO SAY TO
A CERTAIN GENTLEMAN IN COMPANY IN THE DAYS OF COURTSHIP, WHEN, BECAUSE
THINGS DID NOT GO QUITE RIGHT, DID NOT PROCEED WITH ALL THE RAPIDITY
WHICH SUITED HIS FEELINGS, HE WAS APT TO BE IN DESPAIR, AND EXCLAIM THAT
HE WAS SURE AT THIS RATE IT WOULD BE MAY BEFORE HYMEN'S SAFFRON ROBE
WOULD BE PUT ON FOR US. OH! THE PAINS I HAVE BEEN AT TO DISPEL THOSE
GLOOMY IDEAS AND GIVE HIM CHEERFULLER VIEWS! THE CARRIAGE--WE HAD
DISAPPOINTMENTS ABOUT THE CARRIAGE;--ONE MORNING, I REMEMBER, HE CAME TO
ME QUITE IN DESPAIR."

SHE WAS STOPPED BY A SLIGHT FIT OF COUGHING, AND MR. WESTON INSTANTLY
SEIZED THE OPPORTUNITY OF GOING ON.

"YOU WERE MENTIONING MAY. MAY IS THE VERY MONTH WHICH MRS. CHURCHILL
IS ORDERED, OR HAS ORDERED HERSELF, TO SPEND IN SOME WARMER PLACE THAN
ENSCOMBE--IN SHORT, TO SPEND IN LONDON; SO THAT WE HAVE THE AGREEABLE
PROSPECT OF FREQUENT VISITS FROM FRANK THE WHOLE SPRING--PRECISELY THE
SEASON OF THE YEAR WHICH ONE SHOULD HAVE CHOSEN FOR IT: DAYS ALMOST AT
THE LONGEST; WEATHER GENIAL AND PLEASANT, ALWAYS INVITING ONE OUT, AND
NEVER TOO HOT FOR EXERCISE. WHEN HE WAS HERE BEFORE, WE MADE THE BEST
OF IT; BUT THERE WAS A GOOD DEAL OF WET, DAMP, CHEERLESS WEATHER;
THERE ALWAYS IS IN FEBRUARY, YOU KNOW, AND WE COULD NOT DO HALF THAT WE
INTENDED. NOW WILL BE THE TIME. THIS WILL BE COMPLETE ENJOYMENT; AND I
DO NOT KNOW, MRS. ELTON, WHETHER THE UNCERTAINTY OF OUR MEETINGS, THE
SORT OF CONSTANT EXPECTATION THERE WILL BE OF HIS COMING IN TO-DAY OR
TO-MORROW, AND AT ANY HOUR, MAY NOT BE MORE FRIENDLY TO HAPPINESS THAN
HAVING HIM ACTUALLY IN THE HOUSE. I THINK IT IS SO. I THINK IT IS THE
STATE OF MIND WHICH GIVES MOST SPIRIT AND DELIGHT. I HOPE YOU WILL BE
PLEASED WITH MY SON; BUT YOU MUST NOT EXPECT A PRODIGY. HE IS GENERALLY
THOUGHT A FINE YOUNG MAN, BUT DO NOT EXPECT A PRODIGY. MRS. WESTON'S
PARTIALITY FOR HIM IS VERY GREAT, AND, AS YOU MAY SUPPOSE, MOST
GRATIFYING TO ME. SHE THINKS NOBODY EQUAL TO HIM."

"AND I ASSURE YOU, MR. WESTON, I HAVE VERY LITTLE DOUBT THAT MY OPINION
WILL BE DECIDEDLY IN HIS FAVOUR. I HAVE HEARD SO MUCH IN PRAISE OF MR.
FRANK CHURCHILL.--AT THE SAME TIME IT IS FAIR TO OBSERVE, THAT I AM ONE
OF THOSE WHO ALWAYS JUDGE FOR THEMSELVES, AND ARE BY NO MEANS IMPLICITLY
GUIDED BY OTHERS. I GIVE YOU NOTICE THAT AS I FIND YOUR SON, SO I SHALL
JUDGE OF HIM.--I AM NO FLATTERER."

MR. WESTON WAS MUSING.

"I HOPE," SAID HE PRESENTLY, "I HAVE NOT BEEN SEVERE UPON POOR MRS.
CHURCHILL. IF SHE IS ILL I SHOULD BE SORRY TO DO HER INJUSTICE; BUT
THERE ARE SOME TRAITS IN HER CHARACTER WHICH MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR ME TO
SPEAK OF HER WITH THE FORBEARANCE I COULD WISH. YOU CANNOT BE IGNORANT,
MRS. ELTON, OF MY CONNEXION WITH THE FAMILY, NOR OF THE TREATMENT I HAVE
MET WITH; AND, BETWEEN OURSELVES, THE WHOLE BLAME OF IT IS TO BE LAID
TO HER. SHE WAS THE INSTIGATOR. FRANK'S MOTHER WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN
SLIGHTED AS SHE WAS BUT FOR HER. MR. CHURCHILL HAS PRIDE; BUT HIS PRIDE
IS NOTHING TO HIS WIFE'S: HIS IS A QUIET, INDOLENT, GENTLEMANLIKE SORT
OF PRIDE THAT WOULD HARM NOBODY, AND ONLY MAKE HIMSELF A LITTLE HELPLESS
AND TIRESOME; BUT HER PRIDE IS ARROGANCE AND INSOLENCE! AND WHAT
INCLINES ONE LESS TO BEAR, SHE HAS NO FAIR PRETENCE OF FAMILY OR BLOOD.
SHE WAS NOBODY WHEN HE MARRIED HER, BARELY THE DAUGHTER OF A GENTLEMAN;
BUT EVER SINCE HER BEING TURNED INTO A CHURCHILL SHE HAS OUT-CHURCHILL'D
THEM ALL IN HIGH AND MIGHTY CLAIMS: BUT IN HERSELF, I ASSURE YOU, SHE IS
AN UPSTART."

"ONLY THINK! WELL, THAT MUST BE INFINITELY PROVOKING! I HAVE QUITE
A HORROR OF UPSTARTS. MAPLE GROVE HAS GIVEN ME A THOROUGH DISGUST TO
PEOPLE OF THAT SORT; FOR THERE IS A FAMILY IN THAT NEIGHBOURHOOD WHO
ARE SUCH AN ANNOYANCE TO MY BROTHER AND SISTER FROM THE AIRS THEY GIVE
THEMSELVES! YOUR DESCRIPTION OF MRS. CHURCHILL MADE ME THINK OF THEM
DIRECTLY. PEOPLE OF THE NAME OF TUPMAN, VERY LATELY SETTLED THERE, AND
ENCUMBERED WITH MANY LOW CONNEXIONS, BUT GIVING THEMSELVES IMMENSE AIRS,
AND EXPECTING TO BE ON A FOOTING WITH THE OLD ESTABLISHED FAMILIES.
A YEAR AND A HALF IS THE VERY UTMOST THAT THEY CAN HAVE LIVED AT WEST
HALL; AND HOW THEY GOT THEIR FORTUNE NOBODY KNOWS. THEY CAME FROM
BIRMINGHAM, WHICH IS NOT A PLACE TO PROMISE MUCH, YOU KNOW, MR. WESTON.
ONE HAS NOT GREAT HOPES FROM BIRMINGHAM. I ALWAYS SAY THERE IS SOMETHING
DIREFUL IN THE SOUND: BUT NOTHING MORE IS POSITIVELY KNOWN OF THE
TUPMANS, THOUGH A GOOD MANY THINGS I ASSURE YOU ARE SUSPECTED; AND
YET BY THEIR MANNERS THEY EVIDENTLY THINK THEMSELVES EQUAL EVEN TO
MY BROTHER, MR. SUCKLING, WHO HAPPENS TO BE ONE OF THEIR NEAREST
NEIGHBOURS. IT IS INFINITELY TOO BAD. MR. SUCKLING, WHO HAS BEEN ELEVEN
YEARS A RESIDENT AT MAPLE GROVE, AND WHOSE FATHER HAD IT BEFORE HIM--I
BELIEVE, AT LEAST--I AM ALMOST SURE THAT OLD MR. SUCKLING HAD COMPLETED
THE PURCHASE BEFORE HIS DEATH."

THEY WERE INTERRUPTED. TEA WAS CARRYING ROUND, AND MR. WESTON, HAVING
SAID ALL THAT HE WANTED, SOON TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY OF WALKING AWAY.

AFTER TEA, MR. AND MRS. WESTON, AND MR. ELTON SAT DOWN WITH MR.
WOODHOUSE TO CARDS. THE REMAINING FIVE WERE LEFT TO THEIR OWN POWERS,
AND EMMA DOUBTED THEIR GETTING ON VERY WELL; FOR MR. KNIGHTLEY SEEMED
LITTLE DISPOSED FOR CONVERSATION; MRS. ELTON WAS WANTING NOTICE, WHICH
NOBODY HAD INCLINATION TO PAY, AND SHE WAS HERSELF IN A WORRY OF SPIRITS
WHICH WOULD HAVE MADE HER PREFER BEING SILENT.

MR. JOHN KNIGHTLEY PROVED MORE TALKATIVE THAN HIS BROTHER. HE WAS TO
LEAVE THEM EARLY THE NEXT DAY; AND HE SOON BEGAN WITH--

"WELL, EMMA, I DO NOT BELIEVE I HAVE ANY THING MORE TO SAY ABOUT THE
BOYS; BUT YOU HAVE YOUR SISTER'S LETTER, AND EVERY THING IS DOWN AT FULL
LENGTH THERE WE MAY BE SURE. MY CHARGE WOULD BE MUCH MORE CONCISE THAN
HER'S, AND PROBABLY NOT MUCH IN THE SAME SPIRIT; ALL THAT I HAVE TO
RECOMMEND BEING COMPRISED IN, DO NOT SPOIL THEM, AND DO NOT PHYSIC
THEM."

"I RATHER HOPE TO SATISFY YOU BOTH," SAID EMMA, "FOR I SHALL DO ALL
IN MY POWER TO MAKE THEM HAPPY, WHICH WILL BE ENOUGH FOR ISABELLA; AND
HAPPINESS MUST PRECLUDE FALSE INDULGENCE AND PHYSIC."

"AND IF YOU FIND THEM TROUBLESOME, YOU MUST SEND THEM HOME AGAIN."

"THAT IS VERY LIKELY. YOU THINK SO, DO NOT YOU?"

"I HOPE I AM AWARE THAT THEY MAY BE TOO NOISY FOR YOUR FATHER--OR EVEN
MAY BE SOME ENCUMBRANCE TO YOU, IF YOUR VISITING ENGAGEMENTS CONTINUE TO
INCREASE AS MUCH AS THEY HAVE DONE LATELY."

"INCREASE!"

"CERTAINLY; YOU MUST BE SENSIBLE THAT THE LAST HALF-YEAR HAS MADE A
GREAT DIFFERENCE IN YOUR WAY OF LIFE."

"DIFFERENCE! NO INDEED I AM NOT."

"THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT OF YOUR BEING MUCH MORE ENGAGED WITH COMPANY THAN
YOU USED TO BE. WITNESS THIS VERY TIME. HERE AM I COME DOWN FOR ONLY
ONE DAY, AND YOU ARE ENGAGED WITH A DINNER-PARTY!--WHEN DID IT HAPPEN
BEFORE, OR ANY THING LIKE IT? YOUR NEIGHBOURHOOD IS INCREASING, AND YOU
MIX MORE WITH IT. A LITTLE WHILE AGO, EVERY LETTER TO ISABELLA BROUGHT
AN ACCOUNT OF FRESH GAIETIES; DINNERS AT MR. COLE'S, OR BALLS AT THE
CROWN. THE DIFFERENCE WHICH RANDALLS, RANDALLS ALONE MAKES IN YOUR
GOINGS-ON, IS VERY GREAT."

"YES," SAID HIS BROTHER QUICKLY, "IT IS RANDALLS THAT DOES IT ALL."

"VERY WELL--AND AS RANDALLS, I SUPPOSE, IS NOT LIKELY TO HAVE LESS
INFLUENCE THAN HERETOFORE, IT STRIKES ME AS A POSSIBLE THING, EMMA, THAT
HENRY AND JOHN MAY BE SOMETIMES IN THE WAY. AND IF THEY ARE, I ONLY BEG
YOU TO SEND THEM HOME."

"NO," CRIED MR. KNIGHTLEY, "THAT NEED NOT BE THE CONSEQUENCE. LET THEM
BE SENT TO DONWELL. I SHALL CERTAINLY BE AT LEISURE."

"UPON MY WORD," EXCLAIMED EMMA, "YOU AMUSE ME! I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW HOW
MANY OF ALL MY NUMEROUS ENGAGEMENTS TAKE PLACE WITHOUT YOUR BEING OF
THE PARTY; AND WHY I AM TO BE SUPPOSED IN DANGER OF WANTING LEISURE TO
ATTEND TO THE LITTLE BOYS. THESE AMAZING ENGAGEMENTS OF MINE--WHAT HAVE
THEY BEEN? DINING ONCE WITH THE COLES--AND HAVING A BALL TALKED OF,
WHICH NEVER TOOK PLACE. I CAN UNDERSTAND YOU--(NODDING AT MR. JOHN
KNIGHTLEY)--YOUR GOOD FORTUNE IN MEETING WITH SO MANY OF YOUR FRIENDS AT
ONCE HERE, DELIGHTS YOU TOO MUCH TO PASS UNNOTICED. BUT YOU, (TURNING TO
MR. KNIGHTLEY,) WHO KNOW HOW VERY, VERY SELDOM I AM EVER TWO HOURS FROM
HARTFIELD, WHY YOU SHOULD FORESEE SUCH A SERIES OF DISSIPATION FOR ME, I
CANNOT IMAGINE. AND AS TO MY DEAR LITTLE BOYS, I MUST SAY, THAT IF AUNT
EMMA HAS NOT TIME FOR THEM, I DO NOT THINK THEY WOULD FARE MUCH BETTER
WITH UNCLE KNIGHTLEY, WHO IS ABSENT FROM HOME ABOUT FIVE HOURS WHERE SHE
IS ABSENT ONE--AND WHO, WHEN HE IS AT HOME, IS EITHER READING TO HIMSELF
OR SETTLING HIS ACCOUNTS."

MR. KNIGHTLEY SEEMED TO BE TRYING NOT TO SMILE; AND SUCCEEDED WITHOUT
DIFFICULTY, UPON MRS. ELTON'S BEGINNING TO TALK TO HIM.




VOLUME III



CHAPTER I


A VERY LITTLE QUIET REFLECTION WAS ENOUGH TO SATISFY EMMA AS TO THE
NATURE OF HER AGITATION ON HEARING THIS NEWS OF FRANK CHURCHILL. SHE
WAS SOON CONVINCED THAT IT WAS NOT FOR HERSELF SHE WAS FEELING AT ALL
APPREHENSIVE OR EMBARRASSED; IT WAS FOR HIM. HER OWN ATTACHMENT HAD
REALLY SUBSIDED INTO A MERE NOTHING; IT WAS NOT WORTH THINKING OF;--BUT
IF HE, WHO HAD UNDOUBTEDLY BEEN ALWAYS SO MUCH THE MOST IN LOVE OF THE
TWO, WERE TO BE RETURNING WITH THE SAME WARMTH OF SENTIMENT WHICH HE HAD
TAKEN AWAY, IT WOULD BE VERY DISTRESSING. IF A SEPARATION OF TWO
MONTHS SHOULD NOT HAVE COOLED HIM, THERE WERE DANGERS AND EVILS BEFORE
HER:--CAUTION FOR HIM AND FOR HERSELF WOULD BE NECESSARY. SHE DID
NOT MEAN TO HAVE HER OWN AFFECTIONS ENTANGLED AGAIN, AND IT WOULD BE
INCUMBENT ON HER TO AVOID ANY ENCOURAGEMENT OF HIS.

SHE WISHED SHE MIGHT BE ABLE TO KEEP HIM FROM AN ABSOLUTE DECLARATION.
THAT WOULD BE SO VERY PAINFUL A CONCLUSION OF THEIR PRESENT
ACQUAINTANCE! AND YET, SHE COULD NOT HELP RATHER ANTICIPATING SOMETHING
DECISIVE. SHE FELT AS IF THE SPRING WOULD NOT PASS WITHOUT BRINGING A
CRISIS, AN EVENT, A SOMETHING TO ALTER HER PRESENT COMPOSED AND TRANQUIL
STATE.

IT WAS NOT VERY LONG, THOUGH RATHER LONGER THAN MR. WESTON HAD FORESEEN,
BEFORE SHE HAD THE POWER OF FORMING SOME OPINION OF FRANK CHURCHILL'S
FEELINGS. THE ENSCOMBE FAMILY WERE NOT IN TOWN QUITE SO SOON AS HAD BEEN
IMAGINED, BUT HE WAS AT HIGHBURY VERY SOON AFTERWARDS. HE RODE DOWN
FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS; HE COULD NOT YET DO MORE; BUT AS HE CAME FROM
RANDALLS IMMEDIATELY TO HARTFIELD, SHE COULD THEN EXERCISE ALL HER QUICK
OBSERVATION, AND SPEEDILY DETERMINE HOW HE WAS INFLUENCED, AND HOW SHE
MUST ACT. THEY MET WITH THE UTMOST FRIENDLINESS. THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT
OF HIS GREAT PLEASURE IN SEEING HER. BUT SHE HAD AN ALMOST INSTANT DOUBT
OF HIS CARING FOR HER AS HE HAD DONE, OF HIS FEELING THE SAME TENDERNESS
IN THE SAME DEGREE. SHE WATCHED HIM WELL. IT WAS A CLEAR THING HE WAS
LESS IN LOVE THAN HE HAD BEEN. ABSENCE, WITH THE CONVICTION PROBABLY
OF HER INDIFFERENCE, HAD PRODUCED THIS VERY NATURAL AND VERY DESIRABLE
EFFECT.

HE WAS IN HIGH SPIRITS; AS READY TO TALK AND LAUGH AS EVER, AND SEEMED
DELIGHTED TO SPEAK OF HIS FORMER VISIT, AND RECUR TO OLD STORIES: AND HE
WAS NOT WITHOUT AGITATION. IT WAS NOT IN HIS CALMNESS THAT SHE READ
HIS COMPARATIVE DIFFERENCE. HE WAS NOT CALM; HIS SPIRITS WERE EVIDENTLY
FLUTTERED; THERE WAS RESTLESSNESS ABOUT HIM. LIVELY AS HE WAS, IT SEEMED
A LIVELINESS THAT DID NOT SATISFY HIMSELF; BUT WHAT DECIDED HER BELIEF
ON THE SUBJECT, WAS HIS STAYING ONLY A QUARTER OF AN HOUR, AND HURRYING
AWAY TO MAKE OTHER CALLS IN HIGHBURY. "HE HAD SEEN A GROUP OF OLD
ACQUAINTANCE IN THE STREET AS HE PASSED--HE HAD NOT STOPPED, HE WOULD
NOT STOP FOR MORE THAN A WORD--BUT HE HAD THE VANITY TO THINK THEY WOULD
BE DISAPPOINTED IF HE DID NOT CALL, AND MUCH AS HE WISHED TO STAY LONGER
AT HARTFIELD, HE MUST HURRY OFF." SHE HAD NO DOUBT AS TO HIS BEING LESS
IN LOVE--BUT NEITHER HIS AGITATED SPIRITS, NOR HIS HURRYING AWAY, SEEMED
LIKE A PERFECT CURE; AND SHE WAS RATHER INCLINED TO THINK IT IMPLIED A
DREAD OF HER RETURNING POWER, AND A DISCREET RESOLUTION OF NOT TRUSTING
HIMSELF WITH HER LONG.

THIS WAS THE ONLY VISIT FROM FRANK CHURCHILL IN THE COURSE OF TEN DAYS.
HE WAS OFTEN HOPING, INTENDING TO COME--BUT WAS ALWAYS PREVENTED. HIS
AUNT COULD NOT BEAR TO HAVE HIM LEAVE HER. SUCH WAS HIS OWN ACCOUNT AT
RANDALL'S. IF HE WERE QUITE SINCERE, IF HE REALLY TRIED TO COME, IT WAS
TO BE INFERRED THAT MRS. CHURCHILL'S REMOVAL TO LONDON HAD BEEN OF NO
SERVICE TO THE WILFUL OR NERVOUS PART OF HER DISORDER. THAT SHE WAS
REALLY ILL WAS VERY CERTAIN; HE HAD DECLARED HIMSELF CONVINCED OF IT, AT
RANDALLS. THOUGH MUCH MIGHT BE FANCY, HE COULD NOT DOUBT, WHEN HE LOOKED
BACK, THAT SHE WAS IN A WEAKER STATE OF HEALTH THAN SHE HAD BEEN HALF A
YEAR AGO. HE DID NOT BELIEVE IT TO PROCEED FROM ANY THING THAT CARE
AND MEDICINE MIGHT NOT REMOVE, OR AT LEAST THAT SHE MIGHT NOT HAVE MANY
YEARS OF EXISTENCE BEFORE HER; BUT HE COULD NOT BE PREVAILED ON, BY ALL
HIS FATHER'S DOUBTS, TO SAY THAT HER COMPLAINTS WERE MERELY IMAGINARY,
OR THAT SHE WAS AS STRONG AS EVER.

IT SOON APPEARED THAT LONDON WAS NOT THE PLACE FOR HER. SHE COULD
NOT ENDURE ITS NOISE. HER NERVES WERE UNDER CONTINUAL IRRITATION AND
SUFFERING; AND BY THE TEN DAYS' END, HER NEPHEW'S LETTER TO RANDALLS
COMMUNICATED A CHANGE OF PLAN. THEY WERE GOING TO REMOVE IMMEDIATELY TO
RICHMOND. MRS. CHURCHILL HAD BEEN RECOMMENDED TO THE MEDICAL SKILL OF
AN EMINENT PERSON THERE, AND HAD OTHERWISE A FANCY FOR THE PLACE. A
READY-FURNISHED HOUSE IN A FAVOURITE SPOT WAS ENGAGED, AND MUCH BENEFIT
EXPECTED FROM THE CHANGE.

EMMA HEARD THAT FRANK WROTE IN THE HIGHEST SPIRITS OF THIS ARRANGEMENT,
AND SEEMED MOST FULLY TO APPRECIATE THE BLESSING OF HAVING TWO MONTHS
BEFORE HIM OF SUCH NEAR NEIGHBOURHOOD TO MANY DEAR FRIENDS--FOR THE
HOUSE WAS TAKEN FOR MAY AND JUNE. SHE WAS TOLD THAT NOW HE WROTE WITH
THE GREATEST CONFIDENCE OF BEING OFTEN WITH THEM, ALMOST AS OFTEN AS HE
COULD EVEN WISH.

EMMA SAW HOW MR. WESTON UNDERSTOOD THESE JOYOUS PROSPECTS. HE WAS
CONSIDERING HER AS THE SOURCE OF ALL THE HAPPINESS THEY OFFERED. SHE
HOPED IT WAS NOT SO. TWO MONTHS MUST BRING IT TO THE PROOF.

MR. WESTON'S OWN HAPPINESS WAS INDISPUTABLE. HE WAS QUITE DELIGHTED.
IT WAS THE VERY CIRCUMSTANCE HE COULD HAVE WISHED FOR. NOW, IT WOULD BE
REALLY HAVING FRANK IN THEIR NEIGHBOURHOOD. WHAT WERE NINE MILES TO
A YOUNG MAN?--AN HOUR'S RIDE. HE WOULD BE ALWAYS COMING OVER. THE
DIFFERENCE IN THAT RESPECT OF RICHMOND AND LONDON WAS ENOUGH TO MAKE
THE WHOLE DIFFERENCE OF SEEING HIM ALWAYS AND SEEING HIM NEVER. SIXTEEN
MILES--NAY, EIGHTEEN--IT MUST BE FULL EIGHTEEN TO MANCHESTER-STREET--WAS
A SERIOUS OBSTACLE. WERE HE EVER ABLE TO GET AWAY, THE DAY WOULD BE
SPENT IN COMING AND RETURNING. THERE WAS NO COMFORT IN HAVING HIM IN
LONDON; HE MIGHT AS WELL BE AT ENSCOMBE; BUT RICHMOND WAS THE VERY
DISTANCE FOR EASY INTERCOURSE. BETTER THAN NEARER!

ONE GOOD THING WAS IMMEDIATELY BROUGHT TO A CERTAINTY BY THIS
REMOVAL,--THE BALL AT THE CROWN. IT HAD NOT BEEN FORGOTTEN BEFORE,
BUT IT HAD BEEN SOON ACKNOWLEDGED VAIN TO ATTEMPT TO FIX A DAY. NOW,
HOWEVER, IT WAS ABSOLUTELY TO BE; EVERY PREPARATION WAS RESUMED, AND
VERY SOON AFTER THE CHURCHILLS HAD REMOVED TO RICHMOND, A FEW LINES FROM
FRANK, TO SAY THAT HIS AUNT FELT ALREADY MUCH BETTER FOR THE CHANGE, AND
THAT HE HAD NO DOUBT OF BEING ABLE TO JOIN THEM FOR TWENTY-FOUR HOURS AT
ANY GIVEN TIME, INDUCED THEM TO NAME AS EARLY A DAY AS POSSIBLE.

MR. WESTON'S BALL WAS TO BE A REAL THING. A VERY FEW TO-MORROWS STOOD
BETWEEN THE YOUNG PEOPLE OF HIGHBURY AND HAPPINESS.

MR. WOODHOUSE WAS RESIGNED. THE TIME OF YEAR LIGHTENED THE EVIL TO HIM.
MAY WAS BETTER FOR EVERY THING THAN FEBRUARY. MRS. BATES WAS ENGAGED TO
SPEND THE EVENING AT HARTFIELD, JAMES HAD DUE NOTICE, AND HE SANGUINELY
HOPED THAT NEITHER DEAR LITTLE HENRY NOR DEAR LITTLE JOHN WOULD HAVE ANY
THING THE MATTER WITH THEM, WHILE DEAR EMMA WERE GONE.



CHAPTER II


NO MISFORTUNE OCCURRED, AGAIN TO PREVENT THE BALL. THE DAY APPROACHED,
THE DAY ARRIVED; AND AFTER A MORNING OF SOME ANXIOUS WATCHING, FRANK
CHURCHILL, IN ALL THE CERTAINTY OF HIS OWN SELF, REACHED RANDALLS BEFORE
DINNER, AND EVERY THING WAS SAFE.

NO SECOND MEETING HAD THERE YET BEEN BETWEEN HIM AND EMMA. THE ROOM
AT THE CROWN WAS TO WITNESS IT;--BUT IT WOULD BE BETTER THAN A
COMMON MEETING IN A CROWD. MR. WESTON HAD BEEN SO VERY EARNEST IN HIS
ENTREATIES FOR HER ARRIVING THERE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AFTER THEMSELVES,
FOR THE PURPOSE OF TAKING HER OPINION AS TO THE PROPRIETY AND COMFORT OF
THE ROOMS BEFORE ANY OTHER PERSONS CAME, THAT SHE COULD NOT REFUSE HIM,
AND MUST THEREFORE SPEND SOME QUIET INTERVAL IN THE YOUNG MAN'S COMPANY.
SHE WAS TO CONVEY HARRIET, AND THEY DROVE TO THE CROWN IN GOOD TIME, THE
RANDALLS PARTY JUST SUFFICIENTLY BEFORE THEM.

FRANK CHURCHILL SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN ON THE WATCH; AND THOUGH HE DID NOT
SAY MUCH, HIS EYES DECLARED THAT HE MEANT TO HAVE A DELIGHTFUL EVENING.
THEY ALL WALKED ABOUT TOGETHER, TO SEE THAT EVERY THING WAS AS IT SHOULD
BE; AND WITHIN A FEW MINUTES WERE JOINED BY THE CONTENTS OF ANOTHER
CARRIAGE, WHICH EMMA COULD NOT HEAR THE SOUND OF AT FIRST, WITHOUT GREAT
SURPRIZE. "SO UNREASONABLY EARLY!" SHE WAS GOING TO EXCLAIM; BUT SHE
PRESENTLY FOUND THAT IT WAS A FAMILY OF OLD FRIENDS, WHO WERE COMING,
LIKE HERSELF, BY PARTICULAR DESIRE, TO HELP MR. WESTON'S JUDGMENT; AND
THEY WERE SO VERY CLOSELY FOLLOWED BY ANOTHER CARRIAGE OF COUSINS,
WHO HAD BEEN ENTREATED TO COME EARLY WITH THE SAME DISTINGUISHING
EARNESTNESS, ON THE SAME ERRAND, THAT IT SEEMED AS IF HALF THE COMPANY
MIGHT SOON BE COLLECTED TOGETHER FOR THE PURPOSE OF PREPARATORY
INSPECTION.

EMMA PERCEIVED THAT HER TASTE WAS NOT THE ONLY TASTE ON WHICH MR. WESTON
DEPENDED, AND FELT, THAT TO BE THE FAVOURITE AND INTIMATE OF A MAN
WHO HAD SO MANY INTIMATES AND CONFIDANTES, WAS NOT THE VERY FIRST
DISTINCTION IN THE SCALE OF VANITY. SHE LIKED HIS OPEN MANNERS, BUT
A LITTLE LESS OF OPEN-HEARTEDNESS WOULD HAVE MADE HIM A HIGHER
CHARACTER.--GENERAL BENEVOLENCE, BUT NOT GENERAL FRIENDSHIP, MADE A
MAN WHAT HE OUGHT TO BE.--SHE COULD FANCY SUCH A MAN. THE WHOLE PARTY
WALKED ABOUT, AND LOOKED, AND PRAISED AGAIN; AND THEN, HAVING NOTHING
ELSE TO DO, FORMED A SORT OF HALF-CIRCLE ROUND THE FIRE, TO OBSERVE
IN THEIR VARIOUS MODES, TILL OTHER SUBJECTS WERE STARTED, THAT, THOUGH
MAY, A FIRE IN THE EVENING WAS STILL VERY PLEASANT.

EMMA FOUND THAT IT WAS NOT MR. WESTON'S FAULT THAT THE NUMBER OF PRIVY
COUNCILLORS WAS NOT YET LARGER. THEY HAD STOPPED AT MRS. BATES'S DOOR
TO OFFER THE USE OF THEIR CARRIAGE, BUT THE AUNT AND NIECE WERE TO BE
BROUGHT BY THE ELTONS.

FRANK WAS STANDING BY HER, BUT NOT STEADILY; THERE WAS A RESTLESSNESS,
WHICH SHEWED A MIND NOT AT EASE. HE WAS LOOKING ABOUT, HE WAS GOING TO
THE DOOR, HE WAS WATCHING FOR THE SOUND OF OTHER CARRIAGES,--IMPATIENT
TO BEGIN, OR AFRAID OF BEING ALWAYS NEAR HER.

MRS. ELTON WAS SPOKEN OF. "I THINK SHE MUST BE HERE SOON," SAID HE. "I
HAVE A GREAT CURIOSITY TO SEE MRS. ELTON, I HAVE HEARD SO MUCH OF HER.
IT CANNOT BE LONG, I THINK, BEFORE SHE COMES."

A CARRIAGE WAS HEARD. HE WAS ON THE MOVE IMMEDIATELY; BUT COMING BACK,
SAID,

"I AM FORGETTING THAT I AM NOT ACQUAINTED WITH HER. I HAVE NEVER SEEN
EITHER MR. OR MRS. ELTON. I HAVE NO BUSINESS TO PUT MYSELF FORWARD."

MR. AND MRS. ELTON APPEARED; AND ALL THE SMILES AND THE PROPRIETIES
PASSED.

"BUT MISS BATES AND MISS FAIRFAX!" SAID MR. WESTON, LOOKING ABOUT. "WE
THOUGHT YOU WERE TO BRING THEM."

THE MISTAKE HAD BEEN SLIGHT. THE CARRIAGE WAS SENT FOR THEM NOW. EMMA
LONGED TO KNOW WHAT FRANK'S FIRST OPINION OF MRS. ELTON MIGHT BE; HOW
HE WAS AFFECTED BY THE STUDIED ELEGANCE OF HER DRESS, AND HER SMILES OF
GRACIOUSNESS. HE WAS IMMEDIATELY QUALIFYING HIMSELF TO FORM AN OPINION,
BY GIVING HER VERY PROPER ATTENTION, AFTER THE INTRODUCTION HAD PASSED.

IN A FEW MINUTES THE CARRIAGE RETURNED.--SOMEBODY TALKED OF RAIN.--"I
WILL SEE THAT THERE ARE UMBRELLAS, SIR," SAID FRANK TO HIS FATHER:
"MISS BATES MUST NOT BE FORGOTTEN:" AND AWAY HE WENT. MR. WESTON WAS
FOLLOWING; BUT MRS. ELTON DETAINED HIM, TO GRATIFY HIM BY HER OPINION
OF HIS SON; AND SO BRISKLY DID SHE BEGIN, THAT THE YOUNG MAN HIMSELF,
THOUGH BY NO MEANS MOVING SLOWLY, COULD HARDLY BE OUT OF HEARING.

"A VERY FINE YOUNG MAN INDEED, MR. WESTON. YOU KNOW I CANDIDLY TOLD YOU
I SHOULD FORM MY OWN OPINION; AND I AM HAPPY TO SAY THAT I AM EXTREMELY
PLEASED WITH HIM.--YOU MAY BELIEVE ME. I NEVER COMPLIMENT. I THINK HIM
A VERY HANDSOME YOUNG MAN, AND HIS MANNERS ARE PRECISELY WHAT I LIKE AND
APPROVE--SO TRULY THE GENTLEMAN, WITHOUT THE LEAST CONCEIT OR PUPPYISM.
YOU MUST KNOW I HAVE A VAST DISLIKE TO PUPPIES--QUITE A HORROR OF THEM.
THEY WERE NEVER TOLERATED AT MAPLE GROVE. NEITHER MR. SUCKLING NOR
ME HAD EVER ANY PATIENCE WITH THEM; AND WE USED SOMETIMES TO SAY VERY
CUTTING THINGS! SELINA, WHO IS MILD ALMOST TO A FAULT, BORE WITH THEM
MUCH BETTER."

WHILE SHE TALKED OF HIS SON, MR. WESTON'S ATTENTION WAS CHAINED; BUT
WHEN SHE GOT TO MAPLE GROVE, HE COULD RECOLLECT THAT THERE WERE LADIES
JUST ARRIVING TO BE ATTENDED TO, AND WITH HAPPY SMILES MUST HURRY AWAY.

MRS. ELTON TURNED TO MRS. WESTON. "I HAVE NO DOUBT OF ITS BEING OUR
CARRIAGE WITH MISS BATES AND JANE. OUR COACHMAN AND HORSES ARE SO
EXTREMELY EXPEDITIOUS!--I BELIEVE WE DRIVE FASTER THAN ANY BODY.--WHAT
A PLEASURE IT IS TO SEND ONE'S CARRIAGE FOR A FRIEND!--I UNDERSTAND YOU
WERE SO KIND AS TO OFFER, BUT ANOTHER TIME IT WILL BE QUITE UNNECESSARY.
YOU MAY BE VERY SURE I SHALL ALWAYS TAKE CARE OF THEM."

MISS BATES AND MISS FAIRFAX, ESCORTED BY THE TWO GENTLEMEN, WALKED INTO
THE ROOM; AND MRS. ELTON SEEMED TO THINK IT AS MUCH HER DUTY AS MRS.
WESTON'S TO RECEIVE THEM. HER GESTURES AND MOVEMENTS MIGHT BE UNDERSTOOD
BY ANY ONE WHO LOOKED ON LIKE EMMA; BUT HER WORDS, EVERY BODY'S WORDS,
WERE SOON LOST UNDER THE INCESSANT FLOW OF MISS BATES, WHO CAME IN
TALKING, AND HAD NOT FINISHED HER SPEECH UNDER MANY MINUTES AFTER HER
BEING ADMITTED INTO THE CIRCLE AT THE FIRE. AS THE DOOR OPENED SHE WAS
HEARD,

"SO VERY OBLIGING OF YOU!--NO RAIN AT ALL. NOTHING TO SIGNIFY. I DO NOT
CARE FOR MYSELF. QUITE THICK SHOES. AND JANE DECLARES--WELL!--(AS SOON
AS SHE WAS WITHIN THE DOOR) WELL! THIS IS BRILLIANT INDEED!--THIS IS
ADMIRABLE!--EXCELLENTLY CONTRIVED, UPON MY WORD. NOTHING WANTING. COULD
NOT HAVE IMAGINED IT.--SO WELL LIGHTED UP!--JANE, JANE, LOOK!--DID YOU
EVER SEE ANY THING? OH! MR. WESTON, YOU MUST REALLY HAVE HAD ALADDIN'S
LAMP. GOOD MRS. STOKES WOULD NOT KNOW HER OWN ROOM AGAIN. I SAW HER AS
I CAME IN; SHE WAS STANDING IN THE ENTRANCE. 'OH! MRS. STOKES,' SAID
I--BUT I HAD NOT TIME FOR MORE." SHE WAS NOW MET BY MRS. WESTON.--"VERY
WELL, I THANK YOU, MA'AM. I HOPE YOU ARE QUITE WELL. VERY HAPPY TO HEAR
IT. SO AFRAID YOU MIGHT HAVE A HEADACHE!--SEEING YOU PASS BY SO OFTEN,
AND KNOWING HOW MUCH TROUBLE YOU MUST HAVE. DELIGHTED TO HEAR IT INDEED.
AH! DEAR MRS. ELTON, SO OBLIGED TO YOU FOR THE CARRIAGE!--EXCELLENT
TIME. JANE AND I QUITE READY. DID NOT KEEP THE HORSES A MOMENT. MOST
COMFORTABLE CARRIAGE.--OH! AND I AM SURE OUR THANKS ARE DUE TO YOU,
MRS. WESTON, ON THAT SCORE. MRS. ELTON HAD MOST KINDLY SENT JANE A NOTE,
OR WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN.--BUT TWO SUCH OFFERS IN ONE DAY!--NEVER WERE
SUCH NEIGHBOURS. I SAID TO MY MOTHER, 'UPON MY WORD, MA'AM--.' THANK
YOU, MY MOTHER IS REMARKABLY WELL. GONE TO MR. WOODHOUSE'S. I MADE HER
TAKE HER SHAWL--FOR THE EVENINGS ARE NOT WARM--HER LARGE NEW SHAWL--
MRS. DIXON'S WEDDING-PRESENT.--SO KIND OF HER TO THINK OF MY MOTHER!
BOUGHT AT WEYMOUTH, YOU KNOW--MR. DIXON'S CHOICE. THERE WERE THREE
OTHERS, JANE SAYS, WHICH THEY HESITATED ABOUT SOME TIME. COLONEL
CAMPBELL RATHER PREFERRED AN OLIVE. MY DEAR JANE, ARE YOU SURE YOU DID
NOT WET YOUR FEET?--IT WAS BUT A DROP OR TWO, BUT I AM SO AFRAID:--BUT
MR. FRANK CHURCHILL WAS SO EXTREMELY--AND THERE WAS A MAT TO STEP
UPON--I SHALL NEVER FORGET HIS EXTREME POLITENESS.--OH! MR. FRANK
CHURCHILL, I MUST TELL YOU MY MOTHER'S SPECTACLES HAVE NEVER BEEN IN
FAULT SINCE; THE RIVET NEVER CAME OUT AGAIN. MY MOTHER OFTEN TALKS OF
YOUR GOOD-NATURE. DOES NOT SHE, JANE?--DO NOT WE OFTEN TALK OF MR. FRANK
CHURCHILL?--AH! HERE'S MISS WOODHOUSE.--DEAR MISS WOODHOUSE, HOW DO
YOU DO?--VERY WELL I THANK YOU, QUITE WELL. THIS IS MEETING QUITE
IN FAIRY-LAND!--SUCH A TRANSFORMATION!--MUST NOT COMPLIMENT, I KNOW
(EYEING EMMA MOST COMPLACENTLY)--THAT WOULD BE RUDE--BUT UPON MY WORD,
MISS WOODHOUSE, YOU DO LOOK--HOW DO YOU LIKE JANE'S HAIR?--YOU ARE
A JUDGE.--SHE DID IT ALL HERSELF. QUITE WONDERFUL HOW SHE DOES HER
HAIR!--NO HAIRDRESSER FROM LONDON I THINK COULD.--AH! DR. HUGHES I
DECLARE--AND MRS. HUGHES. MUST GO AND SPEAK TO DR. AND MRS. HUGHES FOR A
MOMENT.--HOW DO YOU DO? HOW DO YOU DO?--VERY WELL, I THANK YOU. THIS
IS DELIGHTFUL, IS NOT IT?--WHERE'S DEAR MR. RICHARD?--OH! THERE HE IS.
DON'T DISTURB HIM. MUCH BETTER EMPLOYED TALKING TO THE YOUNG LADIES. HOW
DO YOU DO, MR. RICHARD?--I SAW YOU THE OTHER DAY AS YOU RODE THROUGH
THE TOWN--MRS. OTWAY, I PROTEST!--AND GOOD MR. OTWAY, AND MISS OTWAY
AND MISS CAROLINE.--SUCH A HOST OF FRIENDS!--AND MR. GEORGE AND MR.
ARTHUR!--HOW DO YOU DO? HOW DO YOU ALL DO?--QUITE WELL, I AM MUCH
OBLIGED TO YOU. NEVER BETTER.--DON'T I HEAR ANOTHER CARRIAGE?--WHO CAN
THIS BE?--VERY LIKELY THE WORTHY COLES.--UPON MY WORD, THIS IS CHARMING
TO BE STANDING ABOUT AMONG SUCH FRIENDS! AND SUCH A NOBLE FIRE!--I AM
QUITE ROASTED. NO COFFEE, I THANK YOU, FOR ME--NEVER TAKE COFFEE.--A
LITTLE TEA IF YOU PLEASE, SIR, BY AND BYE,--NO HURRY--OH! HERE IT COMES.
EVERY THING SO GOOD!"

FRANK CHURCHILL RETURNED TO HIS STATION BY EMMA; AND AS SOON AS MISS
BATES WAS QUIET, SHE FOUND HERSELF NECESSARILY OVERHEARING THE DISCOURSE
OF MRS. ELTON AND MISS FAIRFAX, WHO WERE STANDING A LITTLE WAY BEHIND
HER.--HE WAS THOUGHTFUL. WHETHER HE WERE OVERHEARING TOO, SHE COULD NOT
DETERMINE. AFTER A GOOD MANY COMPLIMENTS TO JANE ON HER DRESS AND LOOK,
COMPLIMENTS VERY QUIETLY AND PROPERLY TAKEN, MRS. ELTON WAS EVIDENTLY
WANTING TO BE COMPLIMENTED HERSELF--AND IT WAS, "HOW DO YOU LIKE
MY GOWN?--HOW DO YOU LIKE MY TRIMMING?--HOW HAS WRIGHT DONE MY
HAIR?"--WITH MANY OTHER RELATIVE QUESTIONS, ALL ANSWERED WITH PATIENT
POLITENESS. MRS. ELTON THEN SAID, "NOBODY CAN THINK LESS OF DRESS IN
GENERAL THAN I DO--BUT UPON SUCH AN OCCASION AS THIS, WHEN EVERY BODY'S
EYES ARE SO MUCH UPON ME, AND IN COMPLIMENT TO THE WESTONS--WHO I HAVE
NO DOUBT ARE GIVING THIS BALL CHIEFLY TO DO ME HONOUR--I WOULD NOT WISH
TO BE INFERIOR TO OTHERS. AND I SEE VERY FEW PEARLS IN THE ROOM EXCEPT
MINE.--SO FRANK CHURCHILL IS A CAPITAL DANCER, I UNDERSTAND.--WE SHALL
SEE IF OUR STYLES SUIT.--A FINE YOUNG MAN CERTAINLY IS FRANK CHURCHILL.
I LIKE HIM VERY WELL."

AT THIS MOMENT FRANK BEGAN TALKING SO VIGOROUSLY, THAT EMMA COULD NOT
BUT IMAGINE HE HAD OVERHEARD HIS OWN PRAISES, AND DID NOT WANT TO HEAR
MORE;--AND THE VOICES OF THE LADIES WERE DROWNED FOR A WHILE, TILL
ANOTHER SUSPENSION BROUGHT MRS. ELTON'S TONES AGAIN DISTINCTLY
FORWARD.--MR. ELTON HAD JUST JOINED THEM, AND HIS WIFE WAS EXCLAIMING,

"OH! YOU HAVE FOUND US OUT AT LAST, HAVE YOU, IN OUR SECLUSION?--I WAS
THIS MOMENT TELLING JANE, I THOUGHT YOU WOULD BEGIN TO BE IMPATIENT FOR
TIDINGS OF US."

"JANE!"--REPEATED FRANK CHURCHILL, WITH A LOOK OF SURPRIZE AND
DISPLEASURE.--"THAT IS EASY--BUT MISS FAIRFAX DOES NOT DISAPPROVE IT, I
SUPPOSE."

"HOW DO YOU LIKE MRS. ELTON?" SAID EMMA IN A WHISPER.

"NOT AT ALL."

"YOU ARE UNGRATEFUL."

"UNGRATEFUL!--WHAT DO YOU MEAN?" THEN CHANGING FROM A FROWN TO A
SMILE--"NO, DO NOT TELL ME--I DO NOT WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.--WHERE
IS MY FATHER?--WHEN ARE WE TO BEGIN DANCING?"

EMMA COULD HARDLY UNDERSTAND HIM; HE SEEMED IN AN ODD HUMOUR. HE WALKED
OFF TO FIND HIS FATHER, BUT WAS QUICKLY BACK AGAIN WITH BOTH MR. AND
MRS. WESTON. HE HAD MET WITH THEM IN A LITTLE PERPLEXITY, WHICH MUST BE
LAID BEFORE EMMA. IT HAD JUST OCCURRED TO MRS. WESTON THAT MRS. ELTON
MUST BE ASKED TO BEGIN THE BALL; THAT SHE WOULD EXPECT IT; WHICH
INTERFERED WITH ALL THEIR WISHES OF GIVING EMMA THAT DISTINCTION.--EMMA
HEARD THE SAD TRUTH WITH FORTITUDE.

"AND WHAT ARE WE TO DO FOR A PROPER PARTNER FOR HER?" SAID MR. WESTON.
"SHE WILL THINK FRANK OUGHT TO ASK HER."

FRANK TURNED INSTANTLY TO EMMA, TO CLAIM HER FORMER PROMISE; AND
BOASTED HIMSELF AN ENGAGED MAN, WHICH HIS FATHER LOOKED HIS MOST PERFECT
APPROBATION OF--AND IT THEN APPEARED THAT MRS. WESTON WAS WANTING HIM
TO DANCE WITH MRS. ELTON HIMSELF, AND THAT THEIR BUSINESS WAS TO HELP TO
PERSUADE HIM INTO IT, WHICH WAS DONE PRETTY SOON.--MR. WESTON AND MRS.
ELTON LED THE WAY, MR. FRANK CHURCHILL AND MISS WOODHOUSE FOLLOWED.
EMMA MUST SUBMIT TO STAND SECOND TO MRS. ELTON, THOUGH SHE HAD ALWAYS
CONSIDERED THE BALL AS PECULIARLY FOR HER. IT WAS ALMOST ENOUGH TO MAKE
HER THINK OF MARRYING. MRS. ELTON HAD UNDOUBTEDLY THE ADVANTAGE, AT THIS
TIME, IN VANITY COMPLETELY GRATIFIED; FOR THOUGH SHE HAD INTENDED TO
BEGIN WITH FRANK CHURCHILL, SHE COULD NOT LOSE BY THE CHANGE. MR. WESTON
MIGHT BE HIS SON'S SUPERIOR.--IN SPITE OF THIS LITTLE RUB, HOWEVER,
EMMA WAS SMILING WITH ENJOYMENT, DELIGHTED TO SEE THE RESPECTABLE LENGTH
OF THE SET AS IT WAS FORMING, AND TO FEEL THAT SHE HAD SO MANY HOURS
OF UNUSUAL FESTIVITY BEFORE HER.--SHE WAS MORE DISTURBED BY MR.
KNIGHTLEY'S NOT DANCING THAN BY ANY THING ELSE.--THERE HE WAS, AMONG
THE STANDERS-BY, WHERE HE OUGHT NOT TO BE; HE OUGHT TO BE DANCING,--NOT
CLASSING HIMSELF WITH THE HUSBANDS, AND FATHERS, AND WHIST-PLAYERS, WHO
WERE PRETENDING TO FEEL AN INTEREST IN THE DANCE TILL THEIR RUBBERS WERE
MADE UP,--SO YOUNG AS HE LOOKED!--HE COULD NOT HAVE APPEARED TO GREATER
ADVANTAGE PERHAPS ANYWHERE, THAN WHERE HE HAD PLACED HIMSELF. HIS TALL,
FIRM, UPRIGHT FIGURE, AMONG THE BULKY FORMS AND STOOPING SHOULDERS OF
THE ELDERLY MEN, WAS SUCH AS EMMA FELT MUST DRAW EVERY BODY'S EYES;
AND, EXCEPTING HER OWN PARTNER, THERE WAS NOT ONE AMONG THE WHOLE ROW OF
YOUNG MEN WHO COULD BE COMPARED WITH HIM.--HE MOVED A FEW STEPS NEARER,
AND THOSE FEW STEPS WERE ENOUGH TO PROVE IN HOW GENTLEMANLIKE A MANNER,
WITH WHAT NATURAL GRACE, HE MUST HAVE DANCED, WOULD HE BUT TAKE THE
TROUBLE.--WHENEVER SHE CAUGHT HIS EYE, SHE FORCED HIM TO SMILE; BUT
IN GENERAL HE WAS LOOKING GRAVE. SHE WISHED HE COULD LOVE A BALLROOM
BETTER, AND COULD LIKE FRANK CHURCHILL BETTER.--HE SEEMED OFTEN
OBSERVING HER. SHE MUST NOT FLATTER HERSELF THAT HE THOUGHT OF HER
DANCING, BUT IF HE WERE CRITICISING HER BEHAVIOUR, SHE DID NOT FEEL
AFRAID. THERE WAS NOTHING LIKE FLIRTATION BETWEEN HER AND HER PARTNER.
THEY SEEMED MORE LIKE CHEERFUL, EASY FRIENDS, THAN LOVERS. THAT FRANK
CHURCHILL THOUGHT LESS OF HER THAN HE HAD DONE, WAS INDUBITABLE.

THE BALL PROCEEDED PLEASANTLY. THE ANXIOUS CARES, THE INCESSANT
ATTENTIONS OF MRS. WESTON, WERE NOT THROWN AWAY. EVERY BODY SEEMED
HAPPY; AND THE PRAISE OF BEING A DELIGHTFUL BALL, WHICH IS SELDOM
BESTOWED TILL AFTER A BALL HAS CEASED TO BE, WAS REPEATEDLY GIVEN IN
THE VERY BEGINNING OF THE EXISTENCE OF THIS. OF VERY IMPORTANT, VERY
RECORDABLE EVENTS, IT WAS NOT MORE PRODUCTIVE THAN SUCH MEETINGS USUALLY
ARE. THERE WAS ONE, HOWEVER, WHICH EMMA THOUGHT SOMETHING OF.--THE TWO
LAST DANCES BEFORE SUPPER WERE BEGUN, AND HARRIET HAD NO PARTNER;--THE
ONLY YOUNG LADY SITTING DOWN;--AND SO EQUAL HAD BEEN HITHERTO THE
NUMBER OF DANCERS, THAT HOW THERE COULD BE ANY ONE DISENGAGED WAS THE
WONDER!--BUT EMMA'S WONDER LESSENED SOON AFTERWARDS, ON SEEING MR. ELTON
SAUNTERING ABOUT. HE WOULD NOT ASK HARRIET TO DANCE IF IT WERE POSSIBLE
TO BE AVOIDED: SHE WAS SURE HE WOULD NOT--AND SHE WAS EXPECTING HIM
EVERY MOMENT TO ESCAPE INTO THE CARD-ROOM.

ESCAPE, HOWEVER, WAS NOT HIS PLAN. HE CAME TO THE PART OF THE ROOM WHERE
THE SITTERS-BY WERE COLLECTED, SPOKE TO SOME, AND WALKED ABOUT IN FRONT
OF THEM, AS IF TO SHEW HIS LIBERTY, AND HIS RESOLUTION OF MAINTAINING
IT. HE DID NOT OMIT BEING SOMETIMES DIRECTLY BEFORE MISS SMITH, OR
SPEAKING TO THOSE WHO WERE CLOSE TO HER.--EMMA SAW IT. SHE WAS NOT YET
DANCING; SHE WAS WORKING HER WAY UP FROM THE BOTTOM, AND HAD THEREFORE
LEISURE TO LOOK AROUND, AND BY ONLY TURNING HER HEAD A LITTLE SHE SAW
IT ALL. WHEN SHE WAS HALF-WAY UP THE SET, THE WHOLE GROUP WERE EXACTLY
BEHIND HER, AND SHE WOULD NO LONGER ALLOW HER EYES TO WATCH; BUT MR.
ELTON WAS SO NEAR, THAT SHE HEARD EVERY SYLLABLE OF A DIALOGUE WHICH
JUST THEN TOOK PLACE BETWEEN HIM AND MRS. WESTON; AND SHE PERCEIVED THAT
HIS WIFE, WHO WAS STANDING IMMEDIATELY ABOVE HER, WAS NOT ONLY
LISTENING ALSO, BUT EVEN ENCOURAGING HIM BY SIGNIFICANT GLANCES.--THE
KIND-HEARTED, GENTLE MRS. WESTON HAD LEFT HER SEAT TO JOIN HIM AND SAY,
"DO NOT YOU DANCE, MR. ELTON?" TO WHICH HIS PROMPT REPLY WAS, "MOST
READILY, MRS. WESTON, IF YOU WILL DANCE WITH ME."

"ME!--OH! NO--I WOULD GET YOU A BETTER PARTNER THAN MYSELF. I AM NO
DANCER."

"IF MRS. GILBERT WISHES TO DANCE," SAID HE, "I SHALL HAVE GREAT
PLEASURE, I AM SURE--FOR, THOUGH BEGINNING TO FEEL MYSELF RATHER AN OLD
MARRIED MAN, AND THAT MY DANCING DAYS ARE OVER, IT WOULD GIVE ME VERY
GREAT PLEASURE AT ANY TIME TO STAND UP WITH AN OLD FRIEND LIKE MRS.
GILBERT."

"MRS. GILBERT DOES NOT MEAN TO DANCE, BUT THERE IS A YOUNG LADY
DISENGAGED WHOM I SHOULD BE VERY GLAD TO SEE DANCING--MISS SMITH." "MISS
SMITH!--OH!--I HAD NOT OBSERVED.--YOU ARE EXTREMELY OBLIGING--AND IF I
WERE NOT AN OLD MARRIED MAN.--BUT MY DANCING DAYS ARE OVER, MRS. WESTON.
YOU WILL EXCUSE ME. ANY THING ELSE I SHOULD BE MOST HAPPY TO DO, AT YOUR
COMMAND--BUT MY DANCING DAYS ARE OVER."

MRS. WESTON SAID NO MORE; AND EMMA COULD IMAGINE WITH WHAT SURPRIZE AND
MORTIFICATION SHE MUST BE RETURNING TO HER SEAT. THIS WAS MR. ELTON! THE
AMIABLE, OBLIGING, GENTLE MR. ELTON.--SHE LOOKED ROUND FOR A MOMENT; HE
HAD JOINED MR. KNIGHTLEY AT A LITTLE DISTANCE, AND WAS ARRANGING HIMSELF
FOR SETTLED CONVERSATION, WHILE SMILES OF HIGH GLEE PASSED BETWEEN HIM
AND HIS WIFE.

SHE WOULD NOT LOOK AGAIN. HER HEART WAS IN A GLOW, AND SHE FEARED HER
FACE MIGHT BE AS HOT.

IN ANOTHER MOMENT A HAPPIER SIGHT CAUGHT HER;--MR. KNIGHTLEY LEADING
HARRIET TO THE SET!--NEVER HAD SHE BEEN MORE SURPRIZED, SELDOM MORE
DELIGHTED, THAN AT THAT INSTANT. SHE WAS ALL PLEASURE AND GRATITUDE,
BOTH FOR HARRIET AND HERSELF, AND LONGED TO BE THANKING HIM; AND THOUGH
TOO DISTANT FOR SPEECH, HER COUNTENANCE SAID MUCH, AS SOON AS SHE COULD
CATCH HIS EYE AGAIN.

HIS DANCING PROVED TO BE JUST WHAT SHE HAD BELIEVED IT, EXTREMELY GOOD;
AND HARRIET WOULD HAVE SEEMED ALMOST TOO LUCKY, IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR
THE CRUEL STATE OF THINGS BEFORE, AND FOR THE VERY COMPLETE ENJOYMENT
AND VERY HIGH SENSE OF THE DISTINCTION WHICH HER HAPPY FEATURES
ANNOUNCED. IT WAS NOT THROWN AWAY ON HER, SHE BOUNDED HIGHER THAN EVER,
FLEW FARTHER DOWN THE MIDDLE, AND WAS IN A CONTINUAL COURSE OF SMILES.

MR. ELTON HAD RETREATED INTO THE CARD-ROOM, LOOKING (EMMA TRUSTED) VERY
FOOLISH. SHE DID NOT THINK HE WAS QUITE SO HARDENED AS HIS WIFE, THOUGH
GROWING VERY LIKE HER;--SHE SPOKE SOME OF HER FEELINGS, BY OBSERVING
AUDIBLY TO HER PARTNER,

"KNIGHTLEY HAS TAKEN PITY ON POOR LITTLE MISS SMITH!--VERY GOOD-NATURED,
I DECLARE."

SUPPER WAS ANNOUNCED. THE MOVE BEGAN; AND MISS BATES MIGHT BE HEARD FROM
THAT MOMENT, WITHOUT INTERRUPTION, TILL HER BEING SEATED AT TABLE AND
TAKING UP HER SPOON.

"JANE, JANE, MY DEAR JANE, WHERE ARE YOU?--HERE IS YOUR TIPPET. MRS.
WESTON BEGS YOU TO PUT ON YOUR TIPPET. SHE SAYS SHE IS AFRAID THERE WILL
BE DRAUGHTS IN THE PASSAGE, THOUGH EVERY THING HAS BEEN DONE--ONE DOOR
NAILED UP--QUANTITIES OF MATTING--MY DEAR JANE, INDEED YOU MUST.
MR. CHURCHILL, OH! YOU ARE TOO OBLIGING! HOW WELL YOU PUT IT ON!--SO
GRATIFIED! EXCELLENT DANCING INDEED!--YES, MY DEAR, I RAN HOME, AS I
SAID I SHOULD, TO HELP GRANDMAMA TO BED, AND GOT BACK AGAIN, AND
NOBODY MISSED ME.--I SET OFF WITHOUT SAYING A WORD, JUST AS I TOLD YOU.
GRANDMAMA WAS QUITE WELL, HAD A CHARMING EVENING WITH MR. WOODHOUSE, A
VAST DEAL OF CHAT, AND BACKGAMMON.--TEA WAS MADE DOWNSTAIRS, BISCUITS
AND BAKED APPLES AND WINE BEFORE SHE CAME AWAY: AMAZING LUCK IN SOME
OF HER THROWS: AND SHE INQUIRED A GREAT DEAL ABOUT YOU, HOW YOU WERE
AMUSED, AND WHO WERE YOUR PARTNERS. 'OH!' SAID I, 'I SHALL NOT FORESTALL
JANE; I LEFT HER DANCING WITH MR. GEORGE OTWAY; SHE WILL LOVE TO TELL
YOU ALL ABOUT IT HERSELF TO-MORROW: HER FIRST PARTNER WAS MR. ELTON,
I DO NOT KNOW WHO WILL ASK HER NEXT, PERHAPS MR. WILLIAM COX.' MY DEAR
SIR, YOU ARE TOO OBLIGING.--IS THERE NOBODY YOU WOULD NOT RATHER?--I AM
NOT HELPLESS. SIR, YOU ARE MOST KIND. UPON MY WORD, JANE ON ONE ARM, AND
ME ON THE OTHER!--STOP, STOP, LET US STAND A LITTLE BACK, MRS. ELTON IS
GOING; DEAR MRS. ELTON, HOW ELEGANT SHE LOOKS!--BEAUTIFUL LACE!--NOW WE
ALL FOLLOW IN HER TRAIN. QUITE THE QUEEN OF THE EVENING!--WELL, HERE WE
ARE AT THE PASSAGE. TWO STEPS, JANE, TAKE CARE OF THE TWO STEPS. OH! NO,
THERE IS BUT ONE. WELL, I WAS PERSUADED THERE WERE TWO. HOW VERY ODD!
I WAS CONVINCED THERE WERE TWO, AND THERE IS BUT ONE. I NEVER SAW ANY
THING EQUAL TO THE COMFORT AND STYLE--CANDLES EVERYWHERE.--I WAS TELLING
YOU OF YOUR GRANDMAMA, JANE,--THERE WAS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTMENT.--THE
BAKED APPLES AND BISCUITS, EXCELLENT IN THEIR WAY, YOU KNOW; BUT THERE
WAS A DELICATE FRICASSEE OF SWEETBREAD AND SOME ASPARAGUS BROUGHT IN AT
FIRST, AND GOOD MR. WOODHOUSE, NOT THINKING THE ASPARAGUS QUITE BOILED
ENOUGH, SENT IT ALL OUT AGAIN. NOW THERE IS NOTHING GRANDMAMA LOVES
BETTER THAN SWEETBREAD AND ASPARAGUS--SO SHE WAS RATHER DISAPPOINTED,
BUT WE AGREED WE WOULD NOT SPEAK OF IT TO ANY BODY, FOR FEAR OF
ITS GETTING ROUND TO DEAR MISS WOODHOUSE, WHO WOULD BE SO VERY MUCH
CONCERNED!--WELL, THIS IS BRILLIANT! I AM ALL AMAZEMENT! COULD NOT HAVE
SUPPOSED ANY THING!--SUCH ELEGANCE AND PROFUSION!--I HAVE SEEN NOTHING
LIKE IT SINCE--WELL, WHERE SHALL WE SIT? WHERE SHALL WE SIT? ANYWHERE,
SO THAT JANE IS NOT IN A DRAUGHT. WHERE I SIT IS OF NO CONSEQUENCE.
OH! DO YOU RECOMMEND THIS SIDE?--WELL, I AM SURE, MR. CHURCHILL--ONLY
IT SEEMS TOO GOOD--BUT JUST AS YOU PLEASE. WHAT YOU DIRECT IN THIS HOUSE
CANNOT BE WRONG. DEAR JANE, HOW SHALL WE EVER RECOLLECT HALF THE DISHES
FOR GRANDMAMA? SOUP TOO! BLESS ME! I SHOULD NOT BE HELPED SO SOON, BUT
IT SMELLS MOST EXCELLENT, AND I CANNOT HELP BEGINNING."

EMMA HAD NO OPPORTUNITY OF SPEAKING TO MR. KNIGHTLEY TILL AFTER SUPPER;
BUT, WHEN THEY WERE ALL IN THE BALLROOM AGAIN, HER EYES INVITED
HIM IRRESISTIBLY TO COME TO HER AND BE THANKED. HE WAS WARM IN HIS
REPROBATION OF MR. ELTON'S CONDUCT; IT HAD BEEN UNPARDONABLE RUDENESS;
AND MRS. ELTON'S LOOKS ALSO RECEIVED THE DUE SHARE OF CENSURE.

"THEY AIMED AT WOUNDING MORE THAN HARRIET," SAID HE. "EMMA, WHY IS IT
THAT THEY ARE YOUR ENEMIES?"

HE LOOKED WITH SMILING PENETRATION; AND, ON RECEIVING NO ANSWER, ADDED,
"SHE OUGHT NOT TO BE ANGRY WITH YOU, I SUSPECT, WHATEVER HE MAY
BE.--TO THAT SURMISE, YOU SAY NOTHING, OF COURSE; BUT CONFESS, EMMA,
THAT YOU DID WANT HIM TO MARRY HARRIET."

"I DID," REPLIED EMMA, "AND THEY CANNOT FORGIVE ME."

HE SHOOK HIS HEAD; BUT THERE WAS A SMILE OF INDULGENCE WITH IT, AND HE
ONLY SAID,

"I SHALL NOT SCOLD YOU. I LEAVE YOU TO YOUR OWN REFLECTIONS."

"CAN YOU TRUST ME WITH SUCH FLATTERERS?--DOES MY VAIN SPIRIT EVER TELL
ME I AM WRONG?"

"NOT YOUR VAIN SPIRIT, BUT YOUR SERIOUS SPIRIT.--IF ONE LEADS YOU WRONG,
I AM SURE THE OTHER TELLS YOU OF IT."

"I DO OWN MYSELF TO HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY MISTAKEN IN MR. ELTON. THERE IS
A LITTLENESS ABOUT HIM WHICH YOU DISCOVERED, AND WHICH I DID NOT: AND I
WAS FULLY CONVINCED OF HIS BEING IN LOVE WITH HARRIET. IT WAS THROUGH A
SERIES OF STRANGE BLUNDERS!"

"AND, IN RETURN FOR YOUR ACKNOWLEDGING SO MUCH, I WILL DO YOU THE
JUSTICE TO SAY, THAT YOU WOULD HAVE CHOSEN FOR HIM BETTER THAN HE HAS
CHOSEN FOR HIMSELF.--HARRIET SMITH HAS SOME FIRST-RATE QUALITIES, WHICH
MRS. ELTON IS TOTALLY WITHOUT. AN UNPRETENDING, SINGLE-MINDED, ARTLESS
GIRL--INFINITELY TO BE PREFERRED BY ANY MAN OF SENSE AND TASTE TO SUCH A
WOMAN AS MRS. ELTON. I FOUND HARRIET MORE CONVERSABLE THAN I EXPECTED."

EMMA WAS EXTREMELY GRATIFIED.--THEY WERE INTERRUPTED BY THE BUSTLE OF
MR. WESTON CALLING ON EVERY BODY TO BEGIN DANCING AGAIN.

"COME MISS WOODHOUSE, MISS OTWAY, MISS FAIRFAX, WHAT ARE YOU ALL
DOING?--COME EMMA, SET YOUR COMPANIONS THE EXAMPLE. EVERY BODY IS LAZY!
EVERY BODY IS ASLEEP!"

"I AM READY," SAID EMMA, "WHENEVER I AM WANTED."

"WHOM ARE YOU GOING TO DANCE WITH?" ASKED MR. KNIGHTLEY.

SHE HESITATED A MOMENT, AND THEN REPLIED, "WITH YOU, IF YOU WILL ASK
ME."

"WILL YOU?" SAID HE, OFFERING HIS HAND.

"INDEED I WILL. YOU HAVE SHEWN THAT YOU CAN DANCE, AND YOU KNOW WE ARE
NOT REALLY SO MUCH BROTHER AND SISTER AS TO MAKE IT AT ALL IMPROPER."

"BROTHER AND SISTER! NO, INDEED."



CHAPTER III


THIS LITTLE EXPLANATION WITH MR. KNIGHTLEY GAVE EMMA CONSIDERABLE
PLEASURE. IT WAS ONE OF THE AGREEABLE RECOLLECTIONS OF THE BALL, WHICH
SHE WALKED ABOUT THE LAWN THE NEXT MORNING TO ENJOY.--SHE WAS EXTREMELY
GLAD THAT THEY HAD COME TO SO GOOD AN UNDERSTANDING RESPECTING THE
ELTONS, AND THAT THEIR OPINIONS OF BOTH HUSBAND AND WIFE WERE SO MUCH
ALIKE; AND HIS PRAISE OF HARRIET, HIS CONCESSION IN HER FAVOUR, WAS
PECULIARLY GRATIFYING. THE IMPERTINENCE OF THE ELTONS, WHICH FOR A FEW
MINUTES HAD THREATENED TO RUIN THE REST OF HER EVENING, HAD BEEN THE
OCCASION OF SOME OF ITS HIGHEST SATISFACTIONS; AND SHE LOOKED FORWARD
TO ANOTHER HAPPY RESULT--THE CURE OF HARRIET'S INFATUATION.--FROM
HARRIET'S MANNER OF SPEAKING OF THE CIRCUMSTANCE BEFORE THEY QUITTED THE
BALLROOM, SHE HAD STRONG HOPES. IT SEEMED AS IF HER EYES WERE SUDDENLY
OPENED, AND SHE WERE ENABLED TO SEE THAT MR. ELTON WAS NOT THE SUPERIOR
CREATURE SHE HAD BELIEVED HIM. THE FEVER WAS OVER, AND EMMA COULD
HARBOUR LITTLE FEAR OF THE PULSE BEING QUICKENED AGAIN BY INJURIOUS
COURTESY. SHE DEPENDED ON THE EVIL FEELINGS OF THE ELTONS FOR
SUPPLYING ALL THE DISCIPLINE OF POINTED NEGLECT THAT COULD BE FARTHER
REQUISITE.--HARRIET RATIONAL, FRANK CHURCHILL NOT TOO MUCH IN LOVE, AND
MR. KNIGHTLEY NOT WANTING TO QUARREL WITH HER, HOW VERY HAPPY A SUMMER
MUST BE BEFORE HER!

SHE WAS NOT TO SEE FRANK CHURCHILL THIS MORNING. HE HAD TOLD HER THAT HE
COULD NOT ALLOW HIMSELF THE PLEASURE OF STOPPING AT HARTFIELD, AS HE WAS
TO BE AT HOME BY THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY. SHE DID NOT REGRET IT.

HAVING ARRANGED ALL THESE MATTERS, LOOKED THEM THROUGH, AND PUT THEM ALL
TO RIGHTS, SHE WAS JUST TURNING TO THE HOUSE WITH SPIRITS FRESHENED UP
FOR THE DEMANDS OF THE TWO LITTLE BOYS, AS WELL AS OF THEIR GRANDPAPA,
WHEN THE GREAT IRON SWEEP-GATE OPENED, AND TWO PERSONS ENTERED WHOM SHE
HAD NEVER LESS EXPECTED TO SEE TOGETHER--FRANK CHURCHILL, WITH HARRIET
LEANING ON HIS ARM--ACTUALLY HARRIET!--A MOMENT SUFFICED TO CONVINCE
HER THAT SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY HAD HAPPENED. HARRIET LOOKED WHITE
AND FRIGHTENED, AND HE WAS TRYING TO CHEER HER.--THE IRON GATES AND THE
FRONT-DOOR WERE NOT TWENTY YARDS ASUNDER;--THEY WERE ALL THREE SOON IN
THE HALL, AND HARRIET IMMEDIATELY SINKING INTO A CHAIR FAINTED AWAY.

A YOUNG LADY WHO FAINTS, MUST BE RECOVERED; QUESTIONS MUST BE ANSWERED,
AND SURPRIZES BE EXPLAINED. SUCH EVENTS ARE VERY INTERESTING, BUT THE
SUSPENSE OF THEM CANNOT LAST LONG. A FEW MINUTES MADE EMMA ACQUAINTED
WITH THE WHOLE.

MISS SMITH, AND MISS BICKERTON, ANOTHER PARLOUR BOARDER AT MRS.
GODDARD'S, WHO HAD BEEN ALSO AT THE BALL, HAD WALKED OUT TOGETHER, AND
TAKEN A ROAD, THE RICHMOND ROAD, WHICH, THOUGH APPARENTLY PUBLIC ENOUGH
FOR SAFETY, HAD LED THEM INTO ALARM.--ABOUT HALF A MILE BEYOND HIGHBURY,
MAKING A SUDDEN TURN, AND DEEPLY SHADED BY ELMS ON EACH SIDE, IT BECAME
FOR A CONSIDERABLE STRETCH VERY RETIRED; AND WHEN THE YOUNG LADIES
HAD ADVANCED SOME WAY INTO IT, THEY HAD SUDDENLY PERCEIVED AT A SMALL
DISTANCE BEFORE THEM, ON A BROADER PATCH OF GREENSWARD BY THE SIDE, A
PARTY OF GIPSIES. A CHILD ON THE WATCH, CAME TOWARDS THEM TO BEG; AND
MISS BICKERTON, EXCESSIVELY FRIGHTENED, GAVE A GREAT SCREAM, AND CALLING
ON HARRIET TO FOLLOW HER, RAN UP A STEEP BANK, CLEARED A SLIGHT HEDGE AT
THE TOP, AND MADE THE BEST OF HER WAY BY A SHORT CUT BACK TO HIGHBURY.
BUT POOR HARRIET COULD NOT FOLLOW. SHE HAD SUFFERED VERY MUCH FROM CRAMP
AFTER DANCING, AND HER FIRST ATTEMPT TO MOUNT THE BANK BROUGHT ON SUCH
A RETURN OF IT AS MADE HER ABSOLUTELY POWERLESS--AND IN THIS STATE, AND
EXCEEDINGLY TERRIFIED, SHE HAD BEEN OBLIGED TO REMAIN.

HOW THE TRAMPERS MIGHT HAVE BEHAVED, HAD THE YOUNG LADIES BEEN MORE
COURAGEOUS, MUST BE DOUBTFUL; BUT SUCH AN INVITATION FOR ATTACK COULD
NOT BE RESISTED; AND HARRIET WAS SOON ASSAILED BY HALF A DOZEN CHILDREN,
HEADED BY A STOUT WOMAN AND A GREAT BOY, ALL CLAMOROUS, AND IMPERTINENT
IN LOOK, THOUGH NOT ABSOLUTELY IN WORD.--MORE AND MORE FRIGHTENED, SHE
IMMEDIATELY PROMISED THEM MONEY, AND TAKING OUT HER PURSE, GAVE THEM A
SHILLING, AND BEGGED THEM NOT TO WANT MORE, OR TO USE HER ILL.--SHE
WAS THEN ABLE TO WALK, THOUGH BUT SLOWLY, AND WAS MOVING AWAY--BUT HER
TERROR AND HER PURSE WERE TOO TEMPTING, AND SHE WAS FOLLOWED, OR RATHER
SURROUNDED, BY THE WHOLE GANG, DEMANDING MORE.

IN THIS STATE FRANK CHURCHILL HAD FOUND HER, SHE TREMBLING AND
CONDITIONING, THEY LOUD AND INSOLENT. BY A MOST FORTUNATE CHANCE HIS
LEAVING HIGHBURY HAD BEEN DELAYED SO AS TO BRING HIM TO HER ASSISTANCE
AT THIS CRITICAL MOMENT. THE PLEASANTNESS OF THE MORNING HAD INDUCED
HIM TO WALK FORWARD, AND LEAVE HIS HORSES TO MEET HIM BY ANOTHER ROAD,
A MILE OR TWO BEYOND HIGHBURY--AND HAPPENING TO HAVE BORROWED A PAIR
OF SCISSORS THE NIGHT BEFORE OF MISS BATES, AND TO HAVE FORGOTTEN TO
RESTORE THEM, HE HAD BEEN OBLIGED TO STOP AT HER DOOR, AND GO IN FOR A
FEW MINUTES: HE WAS THEREFORE LATER THAN HE HAD INTENDED; AND BEING
ON FOOT, WAS UNSEEN BY THE WHOLE PARTY TILL ALMOST CLOSE TO THEM. THE
TERROR WHICH THE WOMAN AND BOY HAD BEEN CREATING IN HARRIET WAS THEN
THEIR OWN PORTION. HE HAD LEFT THEM COMPLETELY FRIGHTENED; AND HARRIET
EAGERLY CLINGING TO HIM, AND HARDLY ABLE TO SPEAK, HAD JUST STRENGTH
ENOUGH TO REACH HARTFIELD, BEFORE HER SPIRITS WERE QUITE OVERCOME.
IT WAS HIS IDEA TO BRING HER TO HARTFIELD: HE HAD THOUGHT OF NO OTHER
PLACE.

THIS WAS THE AMOUNT OF THE WHOLE STORY,--OF HIS COMMUNICATION AND OF
HARRIET'S AS SOON AS SHE HAD RECOVERED HER SENSES AND SPEECH.--HE DARED
NOT STAY LONGER THAN TO SEE HER WELL; THESE SEVERAL DELAYS LEFT HIM
NOT ANOTHER MINUTE TO LOSE; AND EMMA ENGAGING TO GIVE ASSURANCE OF HER
SAFETY TO MRS. GODDARD, AND NOTICE OF THERE BEING SUCH A SET OF PEOPLE
IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD TO MR. KNIGHTLEY, HE SET OFF, WITH ALL THE GRATEFUL
BLESSINGS THAT SHE COULD UTTER FOR HER FRIEND AND HERSELF.

SUCH AN ADVENTURE AS THIS,--A FINE YOUNG MAN AND A LOVELY YOUNG WOMAN
THROWN TOGETHER IN SUCH A WAY, COULD HARDLY FAIL OF SUGGESTING CERTAIN
IDEAS TO THE COLDEST HEART AND THE STEADIEST BRAIN. SO EMMA THOUGHT, AT
LEAST. COULD A LINGUIST, COULD A GRAMMARIAN, COULD EVEN A MATHEMATICIAN
HAVE SEEN WHAT SHE DID, HAVE WITNESSED THEIR APPEARANCE TOGETHER, AND
HEARD THEIR HISTORY OF IT, WITHOUT FEELING THAT CIRCUMSTANCES HAD BEEN
AT WORK TO MAKE THEM PECULIARLY INTERESTING TO EACH OTHER?--HOW MUCH
MORE MUST AN IMAGINIST, LIKE HERSELF, BE ON FIRE WITH SPECULATION AND
FORESIGHT!--ESPECIALLY WITH SUCH A GROUNDWORK OF ANTICIPATION AS HER
MIND HAD ALREADY MADE.

IT WAS A VERY EXTRAORDINARY THING! NOTHING OF THE SORT HAD EVER
OCCURRED BEFORE TO ANY YOUNG LADIES IN THE PLACE, WITHIN HER MEMORY; NO
RENCONTRE, NO ALARM OF THE KIND;--AND NOW IT HAD HAPPENED TO THE VERY
PERSON, AND AT THE VERY HOUR, WHEN THE OTHER VERY PERSON WAS CHANCING
TO PASS BY TO RESCUE HER!--IT CERTAINLY WAS VERY EXTRAORDINARY!--AND
KNOWING, AS SHE DID, THE FAVOURABLE STATE OF MIND OF EACH AT THIS
PERIOD, IT STRUCK HER THE MORE. HE WAS WISHING TO GET THE BETTER OF HIS
ATTACHMENT TO HERSELF, SHE JUST RECOVERING FROM HER MANIA FOR MR. ELTON.
IT SEEMED AS IF EVERY THING UNITED TO PROMISE THE MOST INTERESTING
CONSEQUENCES. IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE THAT THE OCCURRENCE SHOULD NOT BE
STRONGLY RECOMMENDING EACH TO THE OTHER.

IN THE FEW MINUTES' CONVERSATION WHICH SHE HAD YET HAD WITH HIM, WHILE
HARRIET HAD BEEN PARTIALLY INSENSIBLE, HE HAD SPOKEN OF HER TERROR,
HER NAIVETE, HER FERVOUR AS SHE SEIZED AND CLUNG TO HIS ARM, WITH A
SENSIBILITY AMUSED AND DELIGHTED; AND JUST AT LAST, AFTER HARRIET'S
OWN ACCOUNT HAD BEEN GIVEN, HE HAD EXPRESSED HIS INDIGNATION AT THE
ABOMINABLE FOLLY OF MISS BICKERTON IN THE WARMEST TERMS. EVERY THING WAS
TO TAKE ITS NATURAL COURSE, HOWEVER, NEITHER IMPELLED NOR ASSISTED.
SHE WOULD NOT STIR A STEP, NOR DROP A HINT. NO, SHE HAD HAD ENOUGH OF
INTERFERENCE. THERE COULD BE NO HARM IN A SCHEME, A MERE PASSIVE SCHEME.
IT WAS NO MORE THAN A WISH. BEYOND IT SHE WOULD ON NO ACCOUNT PROCEED.

EMMA'S FIRST RESOLUTION WAS TO KEEP HER FATHER FROM THE KNOWLEDGE OF
WHAT HAD PASSED,--AWARE OF THE ANXIETY AND ALARM IT WOULD OCCASION: BUT
SHE SOON FELT THAT CONCEALMENT MUST BE IMPOSSIBLE. WITHIN HALF AN HOUR
IT WAS KNOWN ALL OVER HIGHBURY. IT WAS THE VERY EVENT TO ENGAGE THOSE
WHO TALK MOST, THE YOUNG AND THE LOW; AND ALL THE YOUTH AND SERVANTS IN
THE PLACE WERE SOON IN THE HAPPINESS OF FRIGHTFUL NEWS. THE LAST NIGHT'S
BALL SEEMED LOST IN THE GIPSIES. POOR MR. WOODHOUSE TREMBLED AS HE SAT,
AND, AS EMMA HAD FORESEEN, WOULD SCARCELY BE SATISFIED WITHOUT THEIR
PROMISING NEVER TO GO BEYOND THE SHRUBBERY AGAIN. IT WAS SOME COMFORT
TO HIM THAT MANY INQUIRIES AFTER HIMSELF AND MISS WOODHOUSE (FOR HIS
NEIGHBOURS KNEW THAT HE LOVED TO BE INQUIRED AFTER), AS WELL AS MISS
SMITH, WERE COMING IN DURING THE REST OF THE DAY; AND HE HAD
THE PLEASURE OF RETURNING FOR ANSWER, THAT THEY WERE ALL VERY
INDIFFERENT--WHICH, THOUGH NOT EXACTLY TRUE, FOR SHE WAS PERFECTLY WELL,
AND HARRIET NOT MUCH OTHERWISE, EMMA WOULD NOT INTERFERE WITH. SHE HAD
AN UNHAPPY STATE OF HEALTH IN GENERAL FOR THE CHILD OF SUCH A MAN,
FOR SHE HARDLY KNEW WHAT INDISPOSITION WAS; AND IF HE DID NOT INVENT
ILLNESSES FOR HER, SHE COULD MAKE NO FIGURE IN A MESSAGE.

THE GIPSIES DID NOT WAIT FOR THE OPERATIONS OF JUSTICE; THEY TOOK
THEMSELVES OFF IN A HURRY. THE YOUNG LADIES OF HIGHBURY MIGHT HAVE
WALKED AGAIN IN SAFETY BEFORE THEIR PANIC BEGAN, AND THE WHOLE HISTORY
DWINDLED SOON INTO A MATTER OF LITTLE IMPORTANCE BUT TO EMMA AND HER
NEPHEWS:--IN HER IMAGINATION IT MAINTAINED ITS GROUND, AND HENRY AND
JOHN WERE STILL ASKING EVERY DAY FOR THE STORY OF HARRIET AND THE
GIPSIES, AND STILL TENACIOUSLY SETTING HER RIGHT IF SHE VARIED IN THE
SLIGHTEST PARTICULAR FROM THE ORIGINAL RECITAL.



CHAPTER IV


A VERY FEW DAYS HAD PASSED AFTER THIS ADVENTURE, WHEN HARRIET CAME ONE
MORNING TO EMMA WITH A SMALL PARCEL IN HER HAND, AND AFTER SITTING DOWN
AND HESITATING, THUS BEGAN:

"MISS WOODHOUSE--IF YOU ARE AT LEISURE--I HAVE SOMETHING THAT I SHOULD
LIKE TO TELL YOU--A SORT OF CONFESSION TO MAKE--AND THEN, YOU KNOW, IT
WILL BE OVER."

EMMA WAS A GOOD DEAL SURPRIZED; BUT BEGGED HER TO SPEAK. THERE WAS A
SERIOUSNESS IN HARRIET'S MANNER WHICH PREPARED HER, QUITE AS MUCH AS HER
WORDS, FOR SOMETHING MORE THAN ORDINARY.

"IT IS MY DUTY, AND I AM SURE IT IS MY WISH," SHE CONTINUED, "TO HAVE
NO RESERVES WITH YOU ON THIS SUBJECT. AS I AM HAPPILY QUITE AN ALTERED
CREATURE IN ONE RESPECT, IT IS VERY FIT THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE
THE SATISFACTION OF KNOWING IT. I DO NOT WANT TO SAY MORE THAN IS
NECESSARY--I AM TOO MUCH ASHAMED OF HAVING GIVEN WAY AS I HAVE DONE, AND
I DARE SAY YOU UNDERSTAND ME."

"YES," SAID EMMA, "I HOPE I DO."

"HOW I COULD SO LONG A TIME BE FANCYING MYSELF!..." CRIED HARRIET,
WARMLY. "IT SEEMS LIKE MADNESS! I CAN SEE NOTHING AT ALL EXTRAORDINARY
IN HIM NOW.--I DO NOT CARE WHETHER I MEET HIM OR NOT--EXCEPT THAT OF THE
TWO I HAD RATHER NOT SEE HIM--AND INDEED I WOULD GO ANY DISTANCE ROUND
TO AVOID HIM--BUT I DO NOT ENVY HIS WIFE IN THE LEAST; I NEITHER ADMIRE
HER NOR ENVY HER, AS I HAVE DONE: SHE IS VERY CHARMING, I DARE SAY, AND
ALL THAT, BUT I THINK HER VERY ILL-TEMPERED AND DISAGREEABLE--I SHALL
NEVER FORGET HER LOOK THE OTHER NIGHT!--HOWEVER, I ASSURE YOU, MISS
WOODHOUSE, I WISH HER NO EVIL.--NO, LET THEM BE EVER SO HAPPY TOGETHER,
IT WILL NOT GIVE ME ANOTHER MOMENT'S PANG: AND TO CONVINCE YOU THAT I
HAVE BEEN SPEAKING TRUTH, I AM NOW GOING TO DESTROY--WHAT I OUGHT TO
HAVE DESTROYED LONG AGO--WHAT I OUGHT NEVER TO HAVE KEPT--I KNOW THAT
VERY WELL (BLUSHING AS SHE SPOKE).--HOWEVER, NOW I WILL DESTROY IT
ALL--AND IT IS MY PARTICULAR WISH TO DO IT IN YOUR PRESENCE, THAT YOU
MAY SEE HOW RATIONAL I AM GROWN. CANNOT YOU GUESS WHAT THIS PARCEL
HOLDS?" SAID SHE, WITH A CONSCIOUS LOOK.

"NOT THE LEAST IN THE WORLD.--DID HE EVER GIVE YOU ANY THING?"

"NO--I CANNOT CALL THEM GIFTS; BUT THEY ARE THINGS THAT I HAVE VALUED
VERY MUCH."

SHE HELD THE PARCEL TOWARDS HER, AND EMMA READ THE WORDS MOST
PRECIOUS TREASURES ON THE TOP. HER CURIOSITY WAS GREATLY EXCITED.
HARRIET UNFOLDED THE PARCEL, AND SHE LOOKED ON WITH IMPATIENCE. WITHIN
ABUNDANCE OF SILVER PAPER WAS A PRETTY LITTLE TUNBRIDGE-WARE BOX,
WHICH HARRIET OPENED: IT WAS WELL LINED WITH THE SOFTEST COTTON; BUT,
EXCEPTING THE COTTON, EMMA SAW ONLY A SMALL PIECE OF COURT-PLAISTER.

"NOW," SAID HARRIET, "YOU MUST RECOLLECT."

"NO, INDEED I DO NOT."

"DEAR ME! I SHOULD NOT HAVE THOUGHT IT POSSIBLE YOU COULD FORGET WHAT
PASSED IN THIS VERY ROOM ABOUT COURT-PLAISTER, ONE OF THE VERY LAST
TIMES WE EVER MET IN IT!--IT WAS BUT A VERY FEW DAYS BEFORE I HAD MY
SORE THROAT--JUST BEFORE MR. AND MRS. JOHN KNIGHTLEY CAME--I THINK THE
VERY EVENING.--DO NOT YOU REMEMBER HIS CUTTING HIS FINGER WITH YOUR NEW
PENKNIFE, AND YOUR RECOMMENDING COURT-PLAISTER?--BUT, AS YOU HAD NONE
ABOUT YOU, AND KNEW I HAD, YOU DESIRED ME TO SUPPLY HIM; AND SO I TOOK
MINE OUT AND CUT HIM A PIECE; BUT IT WAS A GREAT DEAL TOO LARGE, AND HE
CUT IT SMALLER, AND KEPT PLAYING SOME TIME WITH WHAT WAS LEFT, BEFORE HE
GAVE IT BACK TO ME. AND SO THEN, IN MY NONSENSE, I COULD NOT HELP MAKING
A TREASURE OF IT--SO I PUT IT BY NEVER TO BE USED, AND LOOKED AT IT NOW
AND THEN AS A GREAT TREAT."

"MY DEAREST HARRIET!" CRIED EMMA, PUTTING HER HAND BEFORE HER FACE,
AND JUMPING UP, "YOU MAKE ME MORE ASHAMED OF MYSELF THAN I CAN BEAR.
REMEMBER IT? AYE, I REMEMBER IT ALL NOW; ALL, EXCEPT YOUR SAVING THIS
RELIC--I KNEW NOTHING OF THAT TILL THIS MOMENT--BUT THE CUTTING THE
FINGER, AND MY RECOMMENDING COURT-PLAISTER, AND SAYING I HAD NONE
ABOUT ME!--OH! MY SINS, MY SINS!--AND I HAD PLENTY ALL THE WHILE IN MY
POCKET!--ONE OF MY SENSELESS TRICKS!--I DESERVE TO BE UNDER A CONTINUAL
BLUSH ALL THE REST OF MY LIFE.--WELL--(SITTING DOWN AGAIN)--GO ON--WHAT
ELSE?"

"AND HAD YOU REALLY SOME AT HAND YOURSELF? I AM SURE I NEVER SUSPECTED
IT, YOU DID IT SO NATURALLY."

"AND SO YOU ACTUALLY PUT THIS PIECE OF COURT-PLAISTER BY FOR HIS SAKE!"
SAID EMMA, RECOVERING FROM HER STATE OF SHAME AND FEELING DIVIDED
BETWEEN WONDER AND AMUSEMENT. AND SECRETLY SHE ADDED TO HERSELF, "LORD
BLESS ME! WHEN SHOULD I EVER HAVE THOUGHT OF PUTTING BY IN COTTON A
PIECE OF COURT-PLAISTER THAT FRANK CHURCHILL HAD BEEN PULLING ABOUT! I
NEVER WAS EQUAL TO THIS."

"HERE," RESUMED HARRIET, TURNING TO HER BOX AGAIN, "HERE IS SOMETHING
STILL MORE VALUABLE, I MEAN THAT HAS BEEN MORE VALUABLE, BECAUSE
THIS IS WHAT DID REALLY ONCE BELONG TO HIM, WHICH THE COURT-PLAISTER
NEVER DID."

EMMA WAS QUITE EAGER TO SEE THIS SUPERIOR TREASURE. IT WAS THE END OF AN
OLD PENCIL,--THE PART WITHOUT ANY LEAD.

"THIS WAS REALLY HIS," SAID HARRIET.--"DO NOT YOU REMEMBER ONE
MORNING?--NO, I DARE SAY YOU DO NOT. BUT ONE MORNING--I FORGET EXACTLY
THE DAY--BUT PERHAPS IT WAS THE TUESDAY OR WEDNESDAY BEFORE THAT
EVENING, HE WANTED TO MAKE A MEMORANDUM IN HIS POCKET-BOOK; IT WAS
ABOUT SPRUCE-BEER. MR. KNIGHTLEY HAD BEEN TELLING HIM SOMETHING ABOUT
BREWING SPRUCE-BEER, AND HE WANTED TO PUT IT DOWN; BUT WHEN HE TOOK OUT
HIS PENCIL, THERE WAS SO LITTLE LEAD THAT HE SOON CUT IT ALL AWAY, AND
IT WOULD NOT DO, SO YOU LENT HIM ANOTHER, AND THIS WAS LEFT UPON THE
TABLE AS GOOD FOR NOTHING. BUT I KEPT MY EYE ON IT; AND, AS SOON AS I
DARED, CAUGHT IT UP, AND NEVER PARTED WITH IT AGAIN FROM THAT MOMENT."

"I DO REMEMBER IT," CRIED EMMA; "I PERFECTLY REMEMBER IT.--TALKING
ABOUT SPRUCE-BEER.--OH! YES--MR. KNIGHTLEY AND I BOTH SAYING WE
LIKED IT, AND MR. ELTON'S SEEMING RESOLVED TO LEARN TO LIKE IT TOO. I
PERFECTLY REMEMBER IT.--STOP; MR. KNIGHTLEY WAS STANDING JUST HERE, WAS
NOT HE? I HAVE AN IDEA HE WAS STANDING JUST HERE."

"AH! I DO NOT KNOW. I CANNOT RECOLLECT.--IT IS VERY ODD, BUT I CANNOT
RECOLLECT.--MR. ELTON WAS SITTING HERE, I REMEMBER, MUCH ABOUT WHERE I
AM NOW."--

"WELL, GO ON."

"OH! THAT'S ALL. I HAVE NOTHING MORE TO SHEW YOU, OR TO SAY--EXCEPT THAT
I AM NOW GOING TO THROW THEM BOTH BEHIND THE FIRE, AND I WISH YOU TO SEE
ME DO IT."

"MY POOR DEAR HARRIET! AND HAVE YOU ACTUALLY FOUND HAPPINESS IN
TREASURING UP THESE THINGS?"

"YES, SIMPLETON AS I WAS!--BUT I AM QUITE ASHAMED OF IT NOW, AND WISH I
COULD FORGET AS EASILY AS I CAN BURN THEM. IT WAS VERY WRONG OF ME, YOU
KNOW, TO KEEP ANY REMEMBRANCES, AFTER HE WAS MARRIED. I KNEW IT WAS--BUT
HAD NOT RESOLUTION ENOUGH TO PART WITH THEM."

"BUT, HARRIET, IS IT NECESSARY TO BURN THE COURT-PLAISTER?--I HAVE NOT
A WORD TO SAY FOR THE BIT OF OLD PENCIL, BUT THE COURT-PLAISTER MIGHT BE
USEFUL."

"I SHALL BE HAPPIER TO BURN IT," REPLIED HARRIET. "IT HAS A DISAGREEABLE
LOOK TO ME. I MUST GET RID OF EVERY THING.--THERE IT GOES, AND THERE IS
AN END, THANK HEAVEN! OF MR. ELTON."

"AND WHEN," THOUGHT EMMA, "WILL THERE BE A BEGINNING OF MR. CHURCHILL?"

SHE HAD SOON AFTERWARDS REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THE BEGINNING WAS ALREADY
MADE, AND COULD NOT BUT HOPE THAT THE GIPSY, THOUGH SHE HAD TOLD NO
FORTUNE, MIGHT BE PROVED TO HAVE MADE HARRIET'S.--ABOUT A FORTNIGHT
AFTER THE ALARM, THEY CAME TO A SUFFICIENT EXPLANATION, AND QUITE
UNDESIGNEDLY. EMMA WAS NOT THINKING OF IT AT THE MOMENT, WHICH MADE THE
INFORMATION SHE RECEIVED MORE VALUABLE. SHE MERELY SAID, IN THE COURSE
OF SOME TRIVIAL CHAT, "WELL, HARRIET, WHENEVER YOU MARRY I WOULD ADVISE
YOU TO DO SO AND SO"--AND THOUGHT NO MORE OF IT, TILL AFTER A MINUTE'S
SILENCE SHE HEARD HARRIET SAY IN A VERY SERIOUS TONE, "I SHALL NEVER
MARRY."

EMMA THEN LOOKED UP, AND IMMEDIATELY SAW HOW IT WAS; AND AFTER A
MOMENT'S DEBATE, AS TO WHETHER IT SHOULD PASS UNNOTICED OR NOT, REPLIED,

"NEVER MARRY!--THIS IS A NEW RESOLUTION."

"IT IS ONE THAT I SHALL NEVER CHANGE, HOWEVER."

AFTER ANOTHER SHORT HESITATION, "I HOPE IT DOES NOT PROCEED FROM--I HOPE
IT IS NOT IN COMPLIMENT TO MR. ELTON?"

"MR. ELTON INDEED!" CRIED HARRIET INDIGNANTLY.--"OH! NO"--AND EMMA COULD
JUST CATCH THE WORDS, "SO SUPERIOR TO MR. ELTON!"

SHE THEN TOOK A LONGER TIME FOR CONSIDERATION. SHOULD SHE PROCEED NO
FARTHER?--SHOULD SHE LET IT PASS, AND SEEM TO SUSPECT NOTHING?--PERHAPS
HARRIET MIGHT THINK HER COLD OR ANGRY IF SHE DID; OR PERHAPS IF SHE WERE
TOTALLY SILENT, IT MIGHT ONLY DRIVE HARRIET INTO ASKING HER TO HEAR TOO
MUCH; AND AGAINST ANY THING LIKE SUCH AN UNRESERVE AS HAD BEEN, SUCH
AN OPEN AND FREQUENT DISCUSSION OF HOPES AND CHANCES, SHE WAS PERFECTLY
RESOLVED.--SHE BELIEVED IT WOULD BE WISER FOR HER TO SAY AND KNOW AT
ONCE, ALL THAT SHE MEANT TO SAY AND KNOW. PLAIN DEALING WAS ALWAYS
BEST. SHE HAD PREVIOUSLY DETERMINED HOW FAR SHE WOULD PROCEED, ON ANY
APPLICATION OF THE SORT; AND IT WOULD BE SAFER FOR BOTH, TO HAVE THE
JUDICIOUS LAW OF HER OWN BRAIN LAID DOWN WITH SPEED.--SHE WAS DECIDED,
AND THUS SPOKE--

"HARRIET, I WILL NOT AFFECT TO BE IN DOUBT OF YOUR MEANING. YOUR
RESOLUTION, OR RATHER YOUR EXPECTATION OF NEVER MARRYING, RESULTS FROM
AN IDEA THAT THE PERSON WHOM YOU MIGHT PREFER, WOULD BE TOO GREATLY YOUR
SUPERIOR IN SITUATION TO THINK OF YOU. IS NOT IT SO?"

"OH! MISS WOODHOUSE, BELIEVE ME I HAVE NOT THE PRESUMPTION TO SUPPOSE--
INDEED I AM NOT SO MAD.--BUT IT IS A PLEASURE TO ME TO ADMIRE HIM AT A
DISTANCE--AND TO THINK OF HIS INFINITE SUPERIORITY TO ALL THE REST OF
THE WORLD, WITH THE GRATITUDE, WONDER, AND VENERATION, WHICH ARE SO
PROPER, IN ME ESPECIALLY."

"I AM NOT AT ALL SURPRIZED AT YOU, HARRIET. THE SERVICE HE RENDERED YOU
WAS ENOUGH TO WARM YOUR HEART."

"SERVICE! OH! IT WAS SUCH AN INEXPRESSIBLE OBLIGATION!--THE VERY
RECOLLECTION OF IT, AND ALL THAT I FELT AT THE TIME--WHEN I SAW HIM
COMING--HIS NOBLE LOOK--AND MY WRETCHEDNESS BEFORE. SUCH A CHANGE! IN
ONE MOMENT SUCH A CHANGE! FROM PERFECT MISERY TO PERFECT HAPPINESS!"

"IT IS VERY NATURAL. IT IS NATURAL, AND IT IS HONOURABLE.--YES,
HONOURABLE, I THINK, TO CHUSE SO WELL AND SO GRATEFULLY.--BUT THAT
IT WILL BE A FORTUNATE PREFERENCE IS MORE THAT I CAN PROMISE. I DO NOT
ADVISE YOU TO GIVE WAY TO IT, HARRIET. I DO NOT BY ANY MEANS ENGAGE
FOR ITS BEING RETURNED. CONSIDER WHAT YOU ARE ABOUT. PERHAPS IT WILL BE
WISEST IN YOU TO CHECK YOUR FEELINGS WHILE YOU CAN: AT ANY RATE DO NOT
LET THEM CARRY YOU FAR, UNLESS YOU ARE PERSUADED OF HIS LIKING YOU. BE
OBSERVANT OF HIM. LET HIS BEHAVIOUR BE THE GUIDE OF YOUR SENSATIONS. I
GIVE YOU THIS CAUTION NOW, BECAUSE I SHALL NEVER SPEAK TO YOU AGAIN ON
THE SUBJECT. I AM DETERMINED AGAINST ALL INTERFERENCE. HENCEFORWARD I
KNOW NOTHING OF THE MATTER. LET NO NAME EVER PASS OUR LIPS. WE WERE VERY
WRONG BEFORE; WE WILL BE CAUTIOUS NOW.--HE IS YOUR SUPERIOR, NO DOUBT,
AND THERE DO SEEM OBJECTIONS AND OBSTACLES OF A VERY SERIOUS NATURE; BUT
YET, HARRIET, MORE WONDERFUL THINGS HAVE TAKEN PLACE, THERE HAVE BEEN
MATCHES OF GREATER DISPARITY. BUT TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF. I WOULD NOT
HAVE YOU TOO SANGUINE; THOUGH, HOWEVER IT MAY END, BE ASSURED YOUR
RAISING YOUR THOUGHTS TO HIM, IS A MARK OF GOOD TASTE WHICH I SHALL
ALWAYS KNOW HOW TO VALUE."

HARRIET KISSED HER HAND IN SILENT AND SUBMISSIVE GRATITUDE. EMMA WAS
VERY DECIDED IN THINKING SUCH AN ATTACHMENT NO BAD THING FOR HER FRIEND.
ITS TENDENCY WOULD BE TO RAISE AND REFINE HER MIND--AND IT MUST BE
SAVING HER FROM THE DANGER OF DEGRADATION.



CHAPTER V


IN THIS STATE OF SCHEMES, AND HOPES, AND CONNIVANCE, JUNE OPENED UPON
HARTFIELD. TO HIGHBURY IN GENERAL IT BROUGHT NO MATERIAL CHANGE. THE
ELTONS WERE STILL TALKING OF A VISIT FROM THE SUCKLINGS, AND OF THE USE
TO BE MADE OF THEIR BAROUCHE-LANDAU; AND JANE FAIRFAX WAS STILL AT HER
GRANDMOTHER'S; AND AS THE RETURN OF THE CAMPBELLS FROM IRELAND WAS AGAIN
DELAYED, AND AUGUST, INSTEAD OF MIDSUMMER, FIXED FOR IT, SHE WAS LIKELY
TO REMAIN THERE FULL TWO MONTHS LONGER, PROVIDED AT LEAST SHE WERE ABLE
TO DEFEAT MRS. ELTON'S ACTIVITY IN HER SERVICE, AND SAVE HERSELF FROM
BEING HURRIED INTO A DELIGHTFUL SITUATION AGAINST HER WILL.

MR. KNIGHTLEY, WHO, FOR SOME REASON BEST KNOWN TO HIMSELF, HAD CERTAINLY
TAKEN AN EARLY DISLIKE TO FRANK CHURCHILL, WAS ONLY GROWING TO DISLIKE
HIM MORE. HE BEGAN TO SUSPECT HIM OF SOME DOUBLE DEALING IN HIS PURSUIT
OF EMMA. THAT EMMA WAS HIS OBJECT APPEARED INDISPUTABLE. EVERY THING
DECLARED IT; HIS OWN ATTENTIONS, HIS FATHER'S HINTS, HIS MOTHER-IN-LAW'S
GUARDED SILENCE; IT WAS ALL IN UNISON; WORDS, CONDUCT, DISCRETION, AND
INDISCRETION, TOLD THE SAME STORY. BUT WHILE SO MANY WERE DEVOTING HIM
TO EMMA, AND EMMA HERSELF MAKING HIM OVER TO HARRIET, MR. KNIGHTLEY
BEGAN TO SUSPECT HIM OF SOME INCLINATION TO TRIFLE WITH JANE FAIRFAX. HE
COULD NOT UNDERSTAND IT; BUT THERE WERE SYMPTOMS OF INTELLIGENCE BETWEEN
THEM--HE THOUGHT SO AT LEAST--SYMPTOMS OF ADMIRATION ON HIS SIDE, WHICH,
HAVING ONCE OBSERVED, HE COULD NOT PERSUADE HIMSELF TO THINK ENTIRELY
VOID OF MEANING, HOWEVER HE MIGHT WISH TO ESCAPE ANY OF EMMA'S ERRORS
OF IMAGINATION. SHE WAS NOT PRESENT WHEN THE SUSPICION FIRST AROSE.
HE WAS DINING WITH THE RANDALLS FAMILY, AND JANE, AT THE ELTONS'; AND HE
HAD SEEN A LOOK, MORE THAN A SINGLE LOOK, AT MISS FAIRFAX, WHICH, FROM
THE ADMIRER OF MISS WOODHOUSE, SEEMED SOMEWHAT OUT OF PLACE. WHEN HE WAS
AGAIN IN THEIR COMPANY, HE COULD NOT HELP REMEMBERING WHAT HE HAD SEEN;
NOR COULD HE AVOID OBSERVATIONS WHICH, UNLESS IT WERE LIKE COWPER AND
HIS FIRE AT TWILIGHT,

"MYSELF CREATING WHAT I SAW,"

BROUGHT HIM YET STRONGER SUSPICION OF THERE BEING A SOMETHING OF PRIVATE
LIKING, OF PRIVATE UNDERSTANDING EVEN, BETWEEN FRANK CHURCHILL AND JANE.

HE HAD WALKED UP ONE DAY AFTER DINNER, AS HE VERY OFTEN DID, TO SPEND
HIS EVENING AT HARTFIELD. EMMA AND HARRIET WERE GOING TO WALK; HE JOINED
THEM; AND, ON RETURNING, THEY FELL IN WITH A LARGER PARTY, WHO, LIKE
THEMSELVES, JUDGED IT WISEST TO TAKE THEIR EXERCISE EARLY, AS THE
WEATHER THREATENED RAIN; MR. AND MRS. WESTON AND THEIR SON, MISS BATES
AND HER NIECE, WHO HAD ACCIDENTALLY MET. THEY ALL UNITED; AND, ON
REACHING HARTFIELD GATES, EMMA, WHO KNEW IT WAS EXACTLY THE SORT OF
VISITING THAT WOULD BE WELCOME TO HER FATHER, PRESSED THEM ALL TO GO IN
AND DRINK TEA WITH HIM. THE RANDALLS PARTY AGREED TO IT IMMEDIATELY; AND
AFTER A PRETTY LONG SPEECH FROM MISS BATES, WHICH FEW PERSONS LISTENED
TO, SHE ALSO FOUND IT POSSIBLE TO ACCEPT DEAR MISS WOODHOUSE'S MOST
OBLIGING INVITATION.

AS THEY WERE TURNING INTO THE GROUNDS, MR. PERRY PASSED BY ON HORSEBACK.
THE GENTLEMEN SPOKE OF HIS HORSE.

"BY THE BYE," SAID FRANK CHURCHILL TO MRS. WESTON PRESENTLY, "WHAT
BECAME OF MR. PERRY'S PLAN OF SETTING UP HIS CARRIAGE?"

MRS. WESTON LOOKED SURPRIZED, AND SAID, "I DID NOT KNOW THAT HE EVER HAD
ANY SUCH PLAN."

"NAY, I HAD IT FROM YOU. YOU WROTE ME WORD OF IT THREE MONTHS AGO."

"ME! IMPOSSIBLE!"

"INDEED YOU DID. I REMEMBER IT PERFECTLY. YOU MENTIONED IT AS WHAT
WAS CERTAINLY TO BE VERY SOON. MRS. PERRY HAD TOLD SOMEBODY, AND WAS
EXTREMELY HAPPY ABOUT IT. IT WAS OWING TO HER PERSUASION, AS SHE
THOUGHT HIS BEING OUT IN BAD WEATHER DID HIM A GREAT DEAL OF HARM. YOU
MUST REMEMBER IT NOW?"

"UPON MY WORD I NEVER HEARD OF IT TILL THIS MOMENT."

"NEVER! REALLY, NEVER!--BLESS ME! HOW COULD IT BE?--THEN I MUST HAVE
DREAMT IT--BUT I WAS COMPLETELY PERSUADED--MISS SMITH, YOU WALK AS IF
YOU WERE TIRED. YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY TO FIND YOURSELF AT HOME."

"WHAT IS THIS?--WHAT IS THIS?" CRIED MR. WESTON, "ABOUT PERRY AND A
CARRIAGE? IS PERRY GOING TO SET UP HIS CARRIAGE, FRANK? I AM GLAD HE CAN
AFFORD IT. YOU HAD IT FROM HIMSELF, HAD YOU?"

"NO, SIR," REPLIED HIS SON, LAUGHING, "I SEEM TO HAVE HAD IT FROM
NOBODY.--VERY ODD!--I REALLY WAS PERSUADED OF MRS. WESTON'S HAVING
MENTIONED IT IN ONE OF HER LETTERS TO ENSCOMBE, MANY WEEKS AGO, WITH ALL
THESE PARTICULARS--BUT AS SHE DECLARES SHE NEVER HEARD A SYLLABLE OF
IT BEFORE, OF COURSE IT MUST HAVE BEEN A DREAM. I AM A GREAT DREAMER.
I DREAM OF EVERY BODY AT HIGHBURY WHEN I AM AWAY--AND WHEN I HAVE GONE
THROUGH MY PARTICULAR FRIENDS, THEN I BEGIN DREAMING OF MR. AND MRS.
PERRY."

"IT IS ODD THOUGH," OBSERVED HIS FATHER, "THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE HAD SUCH
A REGULAR CONNECTED DREAM ABOUT PEOPLE WHOM IT WAS NOT VERY LIKELY YOU
SHOULD BE THINKING OF AT ENSCOMBE. PERRY'S SETTING UP HIS CARRIAGE! AND
HIS WIFE'S PERSUADING HIM TO IT, OUT OF CARE FOR HIS HEALTH--JUST
WHAT WILL HAPPEN, I HAVE NO DOUBT, SOME TIME OR OTHER; ONLY A LITTLE
PREMATURE. WHAT AN AIR OF PROBABILITY SOMETIMES RUNS THROUGH A DREAM!
AND AT OTHERS, WHAT A HEAP OF ABSURDITIES IT IS! WELL, FRANK, YOUR DREAM
CERTAINLY SHEWS THAT HIGHBURY IS IN YOUR THOUGHTS WHEN YOU ARE ABSENT.
EMMA, YOU ARE A GREAT DREAMER, I THINK?"

EMMA WAS OUT OF HEARING. SHE HAD HURRIED ON BEFORE HER GUESTS TO
PREPARE HER FATHER FOR THEIR APPEARANCE, AND WAS BEYOND THE REACH OF MR.
WESTON'S HINT.

"WHY, TO OWN THE TRUTH," CRIED MISS BATES, WHO HAD BEEN TRYING IN VAIN
TO BE HEARD THE LAST TWO MINUTES, "IF I MUST SPEAK ON THIS SUBJECT,
THERE IS NO DENYING THAT MR. FRANK CHURCHILL MIGHT HAVE--I DO NOT MEAN
TO SAY THAT HE DID NOT DREAM IT--I AM SURE I HAVE SOMETIMES THE ODDEST
DREAMS IN THE WORLD--BUT IF I AM QUESTIONED ABOUT IT, I MUST ACKNOWLEDGE
THAT THERE WAS SUCH AN IDEA LAST SPRING; FOR MRS. PERRY HERSELF
MENTIONED IT TO MY MOTHER, AND THE COLES KNEW OF IT AS WELL AS
OURSELVES--BUT IT WAS QUITE A SECRET, KNOWN TO NOBODY ELSE, AND ONLY
THOUGHT OF ABOUT THREE DAYS. MRS. PERRY WAS VERY ANXIOUS THAT HE SHOULD
HAVE A CARRIAGE, AND CAME TO MY MOTHER IN GREAT SPIRITS ONE MORNING
BECAUSE SHE THOUGHT SHE HAD PREVAILED. JANE, DON'T YOU REMEMBER
GRANDMAMA'S TELLING US OF IT WHEN WE GOT HOME? I FORGET WHERE WE
HAD BEEN WALKING TO--VERY LIKELY TO RANDALLS; YES, I THINK IT WAS TO
RANDALLS. MRS. PERRY WAS ALWAYS PARTICULARLY FOND OF MY MOTHER--INDEED
I DO NOT KNOW WHO IS NOT--AND SHE HAD MENTIONED IT TO HER IN CONFIDENCE;
SHE HAD NO OBJECTION TO HER TELLING US, OF COURSE, BUT IT WAS NOT TO GO
BEYOND: AND, FROM THAT DAY TO THIS, I NEVER MENTIONED IT TO A SOUL THAT
I KNOW OF. AT THE SAME TIME, I WILL NOT POSITIVELY ANSWER FOR MY HAVING
NEVER DROPT A HINT, BECAUSE I KNOW I DO SOMETIMES POP OUT A THING BEFORE
I AM AWARE. I AM A TALKER, YOU KNOW; I AM RATHER A TALKER; AND NOW AND
THEN I HAVE LET A THING ESCAPE ME WHICH I SHOULD NOT. I AM NOT LIKE
JANE; I WISH I WERE. I WILL ANSWER FOR IT SHE NEVER BETRAYED THE LEAST
THING IN THE WORLD. WHERE IS SHE?--OH! JUST BEHIND. PERFECTLY REMEMBER
MRS. PERRY'S COMING.--EXTRAORDINARY DREAM, INDEED!"

THEY WERE ENTERING THE HALL. MR. KNIGHTLEY'S EYES HAD PRECEDED MISS
BATES'S IN A GLANCE AT JANE. FROM FRANK CHURCHILL'S FACE, WHERE
HE THOUGHT HE SAW CONFUSION SUPPRESSED OR LAUGHED AWAY, HE HAD
INVOLUNTARILY TURNED TO HERS; BUT SHE WAS INDEED BEHIND, AND TOO BUSY
WITH HER SHAWL. MR. WESTON HAD WALKED IN. THE TWO OTHER GENTLEMEN WAITED
AT THE DOOR TO LET HER PASS. MR. KNIGHTLEY SUSPECTED IN FRANK
CHURCHILL THE DETERMINATION OF CATCHING HER EYE--HE SEEMED WATCHING HER
INTENTLY--IN VAIN, HOWEVER, IF IT WERE SO--JANE PASSED BETWEEN THEM
INTO THE HALL, AND LOOKED AT NEITHER.

THERE WAS NO TIME FOR FARTHER REMARK OR EXPLANATION. THE DREAM MUST BE
BORNE WITH, AND MR. KNIGHTLEY MUST TAKE HIS SEAT WITH THE REST ROUND THE
LARGE MODERN CIRCULAR TABLE WHICH EMMA HAD INTRODUCED AT HARTFIELD, AND
WHICH NONE BUT EMMA COULD HAVE HAD POWER TO PLACE THERE AND PERSUADE HER
FATHER TO USE, INSTEAD OF THE SMALL-SIZED PEMBROKE, ON WHICH TWO OF HIS
DAILY MEALS HAD, FOR FORTY YEARS BEEN CROWDED. TEA PASSED PLEASANTLY,
AND NOBODY SEEMED IN A HURRY TO MOVE.

"MISS WOODHOUSE," SAID FRANK CHURCHILL, AFTER EXAMINING A TABLE BEHIND
HIM, WHICH HE COULD REACH AS HE SAT, "HAVE YOUR NEPHEWS TAKEN AWAY THEIR
ALPHABETS--THEIR BOX OF LETTERS? IT USED TO STAND HERE. WHERE IS IT?
THIS IS A SORT OF DULL-LOOKING EVENING, THAT OUGHT TO BE TREATED RATHER
AS WINTER THAN SUMMER. WE HAD GREAT AMUSEMENT WITH THOSE LETTERS ONE
MORNING. I WANT TO PUZZLE YOU AGAIN."

EMMA WAS PLEASED WITH THE THOUGHT; AND PRODUCING THE BOX, THE TABLE
WAS QUICKLY SCATTERED OVER WITH ALPHABETS, WHICH NO ONE SEEMED SO MUCH
DISPOSED TO EMPLOY AS THEIR TWO SELVES. THEY WERE RAPIDLY FORMING WORDS
FOR EACH OTHER, OR FOR ANY BODY ELSE WHO WOULD BE PUZZLED. THE QUIETNESS
OF THE GAME MADE IT PARTICULARLY ELIGIBLE FOR MR. WOODHOUSE, WHO HAD
OFTEN BEEN DISTRESSED BY THE MORE ANIMATED SORT, WHICH MR. WESTON HAD
OCCASIONALLY INTRODUCED, AND WHO NOW SAT HAPPILY OCCUPIED IN LAMENTING,
WITH TENDER MELANCHOLY, OVER THE DEPARTURE OF THE "POOR LITTLE BOYS,"
OR IN FONDLY POINTING OUT, AS HE TOOK UP ANY STRAY LETTER NEAR HIM, HOW
BEAUTIFULLY EMMA HAD WRITTEN IT.

FRANK CHURCHILL PLACED A WORD BEFORE MISS FAIRFAX. SHE GAVE A SLIGHT
GLANCE ROUND THE TABLE, AND APPLIED HERSELF TO IT. FRANK WAS NEXT TO
EMMA, JANE OPPOSITE TO THEM--AND MR. KNIGHTLEY SO PLACED AS TO SEE THEM
ALL; AND IT WAS HIS OBJECT TO SEE AS MUCH AS HE COULD, WITH AS LITTLE
APPARENT OBSERVATION. THE WORD WAS DISCOVERED, AND WITH A FAINT SMILE
PUSHED AWAY. IF MEANT TO BE IMMEDIATELY MIXED WITH THE OTHERS, AND
BURIED FROM SIGHT, SHE SHOULD HAVE LOOKED ON THE TABLE INSTEAD OF
LOOKING JUST ACROSS, FOR IT WAS NOT MIXED; AND HARRIET, EAGER AFTER
EVERY FRESH WORD, AND FINDING OUT NONE, DIRECTLY TOOK IT UP, AND FELL TO
WORK. SHE WAS SITTING BY MR. KNIGHTLEY, AND TURNED TO HIM FOR HELP. THE
WORD WAS BLUNDER; AND AS HARRIET EXULTINGLY PROCLAIMED IT, THERE WAS A
BLUSH ON JANE'S CHEEK WHICH GAVE IT A MEANING NOT OTHERWISE OSTENSIBLE.
MR. KNIGHTLEY CONNECTED IT WITH THE DREAM; BUT HOW IT COULD ALL BE,
WAS BEYOND HIS COMPREHENSION. HOW THE DELICACY, THE DISCRETION OF HIS
FAVOURITE COULD HAVE BEEN SO LAIN ASLEEP! HE FEARED THERE MUST BE SOME
DECIDED INVOLVEMENT. DISINGENUOUSNESS AND DOUBLE DEALING SEEMED TO MEET
HIM AT EVERY TURN. THESE LETTERS WERE BUT THE VEHICLE FOR GALLANTRY AND
TRICK. IT WAS A CHILD'S PLAY, CHOSEN TO CONCEAL A DEEPER GAME ON FRANK
CHURCHILL'S PART.

WITH GREAT INDIGNATION DID HE CONTINUE TO OBSERVE HIM; WITH GREAT ALARM
AND DISTRUST, TO OBSERVE ALSO HIS TWO BLINDED COMPANIONS. HE SAW A SHORT
WORD PREPARED FOR EMMA, AND GIVEN TO HER WITH A LOOK SLY AND DEMURE. HE
SAW THAT EMMA HAD SOON MADE IT OUT, AND FOUND IT HIGHLY ENTERTAINING,
THOUGH IT WAS SOMETHING WHICH SHE JUDGED IT PROPER TO APPEAR TO CENSURE;
FOR SHE SAID, "NONSENSE! FOR SHAME!" HE HEARD FRANK CHURCHILL NEXT SAY,
WITH A GLANCE TOWARDS JANE, "I WILL GIVE IT TO HER--SHALL I?"--AND AS
CLEARLY HEARD EMMA OPPOSING IT WITH EAGER LAUGHING WARMTH. "NO, NO, YOU
MUST NOT; YOU SHALL NOT, INDEED."

IT WAS DONE HOWEVER. THIS GALLANT YOUNG MAN, WHO SEEMED TO LOVE WITHOUT
FEELING, AND TO RECOMMEND HIMSELF WITHOUT COMPLAISANCE, DIRECTLY HANDED
OVER THE WORD TO MISS FAIRFAX, AND WITH A PARTICULAR DEGREE OF SEDATE
CIVILITY ENTREATED HER TO STUDY IT. MR. KNIGHTLEY'S EXCESSIVE CURIOSITY
TO KNOW WHAT THIS WORD MIGHT BE, MADE HIM SEIZE EVERY POSSIBLE MOMENT
FOR DARTING HIS EYE TOWARDS IT, AND IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE HE SAW IT
TO BE DIXON. JANE FAIRFAX'S PERCEPTION SEEMED TO ACCOMPANY HIS;
HER COMPREHENSION WAS CERTAINLY MORE EQUAL TO THE COVERT MEANING,
THE SUPERIOR INTELLIGENCE, OF THOSE FIVE LETTERS SO ARRANGED. SHE WAS
EVIDENTLY DISPLEASED; LOOKED UP, AND SEEING HERSELF WATCHED, BLUSHED
MORE DEEPLY THAN HE HAD EVER PERCEIVED HER, AND SAYING ONLY, "I DID NOT
KNOW THAT PROPER NAMES WERE ALLOWED," PUSHED AWAY THE LETTERS WITH EVEN
AN ANGRY SPIRIT, AND LOOKED RESOLVED TO BE ENGAGED BY NO OTHER WORD
THAT COULD BE OFFERED. HER FACE WAS AVERTED FROM THOSE WHO HAD MADE THE
ATTACK, AND TURNED TOWARDS HER AUNT.

"AYE, VERY TRUE, MY DEAR," CRIED THE LATTER, THOUGH JANE HAD NOT SPOKEN
A WORD--"I WAS JUST GOING TO SAY THE SAME THING. IT IS TIME FOR US TO BE
GOING INDEED. THE EVENING IS CLOSING IN, AND GRANDMAMA WILL BE LOOKING
FOR US. MY DEAR SIR, YOU ARE TOO OBLIGING. WE REALLY MUST WISH YOU GOOD
NIGHT."

JANE'S ALERTNESS IN MOVING, PROVED HER AS READY AS HER AUNT HAD
PRECONCEIVED. SHE WAS IMMEDIATELY UP, AND WANTING TO QUIT THE TABLE; BUT
SO MANY WERE ALSO MOVING, THAT SHE COULD NOT GET AWAY; AND MR. KNIGHTLEY
THOUGHT HE SAW ANOTHER COLLECTION OF LETTERS ANXIOUSLY PUSHED TOWARDS
HER, AND RESOLUTELY SWEPT AWAY BY HER UNEXAMINED. SHE WAS AFTERWARDS
LOOKING FOR HER SHAWL--FRANK CHURCHILL WAS LOOKING ALSO--IT WAS GROWING
DUSK, AND THE ROOM WAS IN CONFUSION; AND HOW THEY PARTED, MR. KNIGHTLEY
COULD NOT TELL.

HE REMAINED AT HARTFIELD AFTER ALL THE REST, HIS THOUGHTS FULL OF
WHAT HE HAD SEEN; SO FULL, THAT WHEN THE CANDLES CAME TO ASSIST HIS
OBSERVATIONS, HE MUST--YES, HE CERTAINLY MUST, AS A FRIEND--AN ANXIOUS
FRIEND--GIVE EMMA SOME HINT, ASK HER SOME QUESTION. HE COULD NOT SEE HER
IN A SITUATION OF SUCH DANGER, WITHOUT TRYING TO PRESERVE HER. IT WAS
HIS DUTY.

"PRAY, EMMA," SAID HE, "MAY I ASK IN WHAT LAY THE GREAT AMUSEMENT, THE
POIGNANT STING OF THE LAST WORD GIVEN TO YOU AND MISS FAIRFAX? I SAW THE
WORD, AND AM CURIOUS TO KNOW HOW IT COULD BE SO VERY ENTERTAINING TO THE
ONE, AND SO VERY DISTRESSING TO THE OTHER."

EMMA WAS EXTREMELY CONFUSED. SHE COULD NOT ENDURE TO GIVE HIM THE TRUE
EXPLANATION; FOR THOUGH HER SUSPICIONS WERE BY NO MEANS REMOVED, SHE WAS
REALLY ASHAMED OF HAVING EVER IMPARTED THEM.

"OH!" SHE CRIED IN EVIDENT EMBARRASSMENT, "IT ALL MEANT NOTHING; A MERE
JOKE AMONG OURSELVES."

"THE JOKE," HE REPLIED GRAVELY, "SEEMED CONFINED TO YOU AND MR.
CHURCHILL."

HE HAD HOPED SHE WOULD SPEAK AGAIN, BUT SHE DID NOT. SHE WOULD RATHER
BUSY HERSELF ABOUT ANY THING THAN SPEAK. HE SAT A LITTLE WHILE IN
DOUBT. A VARIETY OF EVILS CROSSED HIS MIND. INTERFERENCE--FRUITLESS
INTERFERENCE. EMMA'S CONFUSION, AND THE ACKNOWLEDGED INTIMACY, SEEMED TO
DECLARE HER AFFECTION ENGAGED. YET HE WOULD SPEAK. HE OWED IT TO HER,
TO RISK ANY THING THAT MIGHT BE INVOLVED IN AN UNWELCOME INTERFERENCE,
RATHER THAN HER WELFARE; TO ENCOUNTER ANY THING, RATHER THAN THE
REMEMBRANCE OF NEGLECT IN SUCH A CAUSE.

"MY DEAR EMMA," SAID HE AT LAST, WITH EARNEST KINDNESS, "DO YOU
THINK YOU PERFECTLY UNDERSTAND THE DEGREE OF ACQUAINTANCE BETWEEN THE
GENTLEMAN AND LADY WE HAVE BEEN SPEAKING OF?"

"BETWEEN MR. FRANK CHURCHILL AND MISS FAIRFAX? OH! YES, PERFECTLY.--WHY
DO YOU MAKE A DOUBT OF IT?"

"HAVE YOU NEVER AT ANY TIME HAD REASON TO THINK THAT HE ADMIRED HER, OR
THAT SHE ADMIRED HIM?"

"NEVER, NEVER!" SHE CRIED WITH A MOST OPEN EAGERNESS--"NEVER, FOR THE
TWENTIETH PART OF A MOMENT, DID SUCH AN IDEA OCCUR TO ME. AND HOW COULD
IT POSSIBLY COME INTO YOUR HEAD?"

"I HAVE LATELY IMAGINED THAT I SAW SYMPTOMS OF ATTACHMENT BETWEEN
THEM--CERTAIN EXPRESSIVE LOOKS, WHICH I DID NOT BELIEVE MEANT TO BE
PUBLIC."

"OH! YOU AMUSE ME EXCESSIVELY. I AM DELIGHTED TO FIND THAT YOU CAN
VOUCHSAFE TO LET YOUR IMAGINATION WANDER--BUT IT WILL NOT DO--VERY SORRY
TO CHECK YOU IN YOUR FIRST ESSAY--BUT INDEED IT WILL NOT DO. THERE IS NO
ADMIRATION BETWEEN THEM, I DO ASSURE YOU; AND THE APPEARANCES WHICH
HAVE CAUGHT YOU, HAVE ARISEN FROM SOME PECULIAR CIRCUMSTANCES--FEELINGS
RATHER OF A TOTALLY DIFFERENT NATURE--IT IS IMPOSSIBLE EXACTLY TO
EXPLAIN:--THERE IS A GOOD DEAL OF NONSENSE IN IT--BUT THE PART WHICH IS
CAPABLE OF BEING COMMUNICATED, WHICH IS SENSE, IS, THAT THEY ARE AS FAR
FROM ANY ATTACHMENT OR ADMIRATION FOR ONE ANOTHER, AS ANY TWO BEINGS IN
THE WORLD CAN BE. THAT IS, I PRESUME IT TO BE SO ON HER SIDE, AND I
CAN ANSWER FOR ITS BEING SO ON HIS. I WILL ANSWER FOR THE GENTLEMAN'S
INDIFFERENCE."

SHE SPOKE WITH A CONFIDENCE WHICH STAGGERED, WITH A SATISFACTION
WHICH SILENCED, MR. KNIGHTLEY. SHE WAS IN GAY SPIRITS, AND WOULD HAVE
PROLONGED THE CONVERSATION, WANTING TO HEAR THE PARTICULARS OF HIS
SUSPICIONS, EVERY LOOK DESCRIBED, AND ALL THE WHERES AND HOWS OF A
CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH HIGHLY ENTERTAINED HER: BUT HIS GAIETY DID NOT MEET
HERS. HE FOUND HE COULD NOT BE USEFUL, AND HIS FEELINGS WERE TOO MUCH
IRRITATED FOR TALKING. THAT HE MIGHT NOT BE IRRITATED INTO AN ABSOLUTE
FEVER, BY THE FIRE WHICH MR. WOODHOUSE'S TENDER HABITS REQUIRED ALMOST
EVERY EVENING THROUGHOUT THE YEAR, HE SOON AFTERWARDS TOOK A HASTY
LEAVE, AND WALKED HOME TO THE COOLNESS AND SOLITUDE OF DONWELL ABBEY.



CHAPTER VI


AFTER BEING LONG FED WITH HOPES OF A SPEEDY VISIT FROM MR. AND MRS.
SUCKLING, THE HIGHBURY WORLD WERE OBLIGED TO ENDURE THE MORTIFICATION
OF HEARING THAT THEY COULD NOT POSSIBLY COME TILL THE AUTUMN. NO SUCH
IMPORTATION OF NOVELTIES COULD ENRICH THEIR INTELLECTUAL STORES AT
PRESENT. IN THE DAILY INTERCHANGE OF NEWS, THEY MUST BE AGAIN RESTRICTED
TO THE OTHER TOPICS WITH WHICH FOR A WHILE THE SUCKLINGS' COMING HAD
BEEN UNITED, SUCH AS THE LAST ACCOUNTS OF MRS. CHURCHILL, WHOSE HEALTH
SEEMED EVERY DAY TO SUPPLY A DIFFERENT REPORT, AND THE SITUATION OF MRS.
WESTON, WHOSE HAPPINESS IT WAS TO BE HOPED MIGHT EVENTUALLY BE AS MUCH
INCREASED BY THE ARRIVAL OF A CHILD, AS THAT OF ALL HER NEIGHBOURS WAS
BY THE APPROACH OF IT.

MRS. ELTON WAS VERY MUCH DISAPPOINTED. IT WAS THE DELAY OF A GREAT DEAL
OF PLEASURE AND PARADE. HER INTRODUCTIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS MUST ALL
WAIT, AND EVERY PROJECTED PARTY BE STILL ONLY TALKED OF. SO SHE THOUGHT
AT FIRST;--BUT A LITTLE CONSIDERATION CONVINCED HER THAT EVERY THING
NEED NOT BE PUT OFF. WHY SHOULD NOT THEY EXPLORE TO BOX HILL THOUGH
THE SUCKLINGS DID NOT COME? THEY COULD GO THERE AGAIN WITH THEM IN THE
AUTUMN. IT WAS SETTLED THAT THEY SHOULD GO TO BOX HILL. THAT THERE WAS
TO BE SUCH A PARTY HAD BEEN LONG GENERALLY KNOWN: IT HAD EVEN GIVEN THE
IDEA OF ANOTHER. EMMA HAD NEVER BEEN TO BOX HILL; SHE WISHED TO SEE WHAT
EVERY BODY FOUND SO WELL WORTH SEEING, AND SHE AND MR. WESTON HAD AGREED
TO CHUSE SOME FINE MORNING AND DRIVE THITHER. TWO OR THREE MORE OF THE
CHOSEN ONLY WERE TO BE ADMITTED TO JOIN THEM, AND IT WAS TO BE DONE IN A
QUIET, UNPRETENDING, ELEGANT WAY, INFINITELY SUPERIOR TO THE BUSTLE AND
PREPARATION, THE REGULAR EATING AND DRINKING, AND PICNIC PARADE OF THE
ELTONS AND THE SUCKLINGS.

THIS WAS SO VERY WELL UNDERSTOOD BETWEEN THEM, THAT EMMA COULD NOT BUT
FEEL SOME SURPRISE, AND A LITTLE DISPLEASURE, ON HEARING FROM MR. WESTON
THAT HE HAD BEEN PROPOSING TO MRS. ELTON, AS HER BROTHER AND SISTER HAD
FAILED HER, THAT THE TWO PARTIES SHOULD UNITE, AND GO TOGETHER; AND THAT
AS MRS. ELTON HAD VERY READILY ACCEDED TO IT, SO IT WAS TO BE, IF SHE
HAD NO OBJECTION. NOW, AS HER OBJECTION WAS NOTHING BUT HER VERY GREAT
DISLIKE OF MRS. ELTON, OF WHICH MR. WESTON MUST ALREADY BE PERFECTLY
AWARE, IT WAS NOT WORTH BRINGING FORWARD AGAIN:--IT COULD NOT BE DONE
WITHOUT A REPROOF TO HIM, WHICH WOULD BE GIVING PAIN TO HIS WIFE; AND
SHE FOUND HERSELF THEREFORE OBLIGED TO CONSENT TO AN ARRANGEMENT WHICH
SHE WOULD HAVE DONE A GREAT DEAL TO AVOID; AN ARRANGEMENT WHICH WOULD
PROBABLY EXPOSE HER EVEN TO THE DEGRADATION OF BEING SAID TO BE OF MRS.
ELTON'S PARTY! EVERY FEELING WAS OFFENDED; AND THE FORBEARANCE OF HER
OUTWARD SUBMISSION LEFT A HEAVY ARREAR DUE OF SECRET SEVERITY IN HER
REFLECTIONS ON THE UNMANAGEABLE GOODWILL OF MR. WESTON'S TEMPER.

"I AM GLAD YOU APPROVE OF WHAT I HAVE DONE," SAID HE VERY COMFORTABLY.
"BUT I THOUGHT YOU WOULD. SUCH SCHEMES AS THESE ARE NOTHING WITHOUT
NUMBERS. ONE CANNOT HAVE TOO LARGE A PARTY. A LARGE PARTY SECURES ITS
OWN AMUSEMENT. AND SHE IS A GOOD-NATURED WOMAN AFTER ALL. ONE COULD NOT
LEAVE HER OUT."

EMMA DENIED NONE OF IT ALOUD, AND AGREED TO NONE OF IT IN PRIVATE.

IT WAS NOW THE MIDDLE OF JUNE, AND THE WEATHER FINE; AND MRS. ELTON
WAS GROWING IMPATIENT TO NAME THE DAY, AND SETTLE WITH MR. WESTON AS TO
PIGEON-PIES AND COLD LAMB, WHEN A LAME CARRIAGE-HORSE THREW EVERY THING
INTO SAD UNCERTAINTY. IT MIGHT BE WEEKS, IT MIGHT BE ONLY A FEW DAYS,
BEFORE THE HORSE WERE USEABLE; BUT NO PREPARATIONS COULD BE VENTURED
ON, AND IT WAS ALL MELANCHOLY STAGNATION. MRS. ELTON'S RESOURCES WERE
INADEQUATE TO SUCH AN ATTACK.

"IS NOT THIS MOST VEXATIOUS, KNIGHTLEY?" SHE CRIED.--"AND SUCH WEATHER
FOR EXPLORING!--THESE DELAYS AND DISAPPOINTMENTS ARE QUITE ODIOUS. WHAT
ARE WE TO DO?--THE YEAR WILL WEAR AWAY AT THIS RATE, AND NOTHING
DONE. BEFORE THIS TIME LAST YEAR I ASSURE YOU WE HAD HAD A DELIGHTFUL
EXPLORING PARTY FROM MAPLE GROVE TO KINGS WESTON."

"YOU HAD BETTER EXPLORE TO DONWELL," REPLIED MR. KNIGHTLEY. "THAT MAY
BE DONE WITHOUT HORSES. COME, AND EAT MY STRAWBERRIES. THEY ARE RIPENING
FAST."

IF MR. KNIGHTLEY DID NOT BEGIN SERIOUSLY, HE WAS OBLIGED TO PROCEED SO,
FOR HIS PROPOSAL WAS CAUGHT AT WITH DELIGHT; AND THE "OH! I SHOULD LIKE
IT OF ALL THINGS," WAS NOT PLAINER IN WORDS THAN MANNER. DONWELL WAS
FAMOUS FOR ITS STRAWBERRY-BEDS, WHICH SEEMED A PLEA FOR THE INVITATION:
BUT NO PLEA WAS NECESSARY; CABBAGE-BEDS WOULD HAVE BEEN ENOUGH TO TEMPT
THE LADY, WHO ONLY WANTED TO BE GOING SOMEWHERE. SHE PROMISED HIM AGAIN
AND AGAIN TO COME--MUCH OFTENER THAN HE DOUBTED--AND WAS EXTREMELY
GRATIFIED BY SUCH A PROOF OF INTIMACY, SUCH A DISTINGUISHING COMPLIMENT
AS SHE CHOSE TO CONSIDER IT.

"YOU MAY DEPEND UPON ME," SAID SHE. "I CERTAINLY WILL COME. NAME YOUR
DAY, AND I WILL COME. YOU WILL ALLOW ME TO BRING JANE FAIRFAX?"

"I CANNOT NAME A DAY," SAID HE, "TILL I HAVE SPOKEN TO SOME OTHERS WHOM
I WOULD WISH TO MEET YOU."

"OH! LEAVE ALL THAT TO ME. ONLY GIVE ME A CARTE-BLANCHE.--I AM LADY
PATRONESS, YOU KNOW. IT IS MY PARTY. I WILL BRING FRIENDS WITH ME."

"I HOPE YOU WILL BRING ELTON," SAID HE: "BUT I WILL NOT TROUBLE YOU TO
GIVE ANY OTHER INVITATIONS."

"OH! NOW YOU ARE LOOKING VERY SLY. BUT CONSIDER--YOU NEED NOT BE AFRAID
OF DELEGATING POWER TO ME. I AM NO YOUNG LADY ON HER PREFERMENT.
MARRIED WOMEN, YOU KNOW, MAY BE SAFELY AUTHORISED. IT IS MY PARTY. LEAVE
IT ALL TO ME. I WILL INVITE YOUR GUESTS."

"NO,"--HE CALMLY REPLIED,--"THERE IS BUT ONE MARRIED WOMAN IN THE WORLD
WHOM I CAN EVER ALLOW TO INVITE WHAT GUESTS SHE PLEASES TO DONWELL, AND
THAT ONE IS--"

"--MRS. WESTON, I SUPPOSE," INTERRUPTED MRS. ELTON, RATHER MORTIFIED.

"NO--MRS. KNIGHTLEY;--AND TILL SHE IS IN BEING, I WILL MANAGE SUCH
MATTERS MYSELF."

"AH! YOU ARE AN ODD CREATURE!" SHE CRIED, SATISFIED TO HAVE NO ONE
PREFERRED TO HERSELF.--"YOU ARE A HUMOURIST, AND MAY SAY WHAT YOU
LIKE. QUITE A HUMOURIST. WELL, I SHALL BRING JANE WITH ME--JANE AND HER
AUNT.--THE REST I LEAVE TO YOU. I HAVE NO OBJECTIONS AT ALL TO MEETING
THE HARTFIELD FAMILY. DON'T SCRUPLE. I KNOW YOU ARE ATTACHED TO THEM."

"YOU CERTAINLY WILL MEET THEM IF I CAN PREVAIL; AND I SHALL CALL ON MISS
BATES IN MY WAY HOME."

"THAT'S QUITE UNNECESSARY; I SEE JANE EVERY DAY:--BUT AS YOU LIKE. IT
IS TO BE A MORNING SCHEME, YOU KNOW, KNIGHTLEY; QUITE A SIMPLE THING. I
SHALL WEAR A LARGE BONNET, AND BRING ONE OF MY LITTLE BASKETS HANGING
ON MY ARM. HERE,--PROBABLY THIS BASKET WITH PINK RIBBON. NOTHING CAN BE
MORE SIMPLE, YOU SEE. AND JANE WILL HAVE SUCH ANOTHER. THERE IS TO BE
NO FORM OR PARADE--A SORT OF GIPSY PARTY. WE ARE TO WALK ABOUT
YOUR GARDENS, AND GATHER THE STRAWBERRIES OURSELVES, AND SIT UNDER
TREES;--AND WHATEVER ELSE YOU MAY LIKE TO PROVIDE, IT IS TO BE ALL OUT
OF DOORS--A TABLE SPREAD IN THE SHADE, YOU KNOW. EVERY THING AS NATURAL
AND SIMPLE AS POSSIBLE. IS NOT THAT YOUR IDEA?"

"NOT QUITE. MY IDEA OF THE SIMPLE AND THE NATURAL WILL BE TO HAVE
THE TABLE SPREAD IN THE DINING-ROOM. THE NATURE AND THE SIMPLICITY OF
GENTLEMEN AND LADIES, WITH THEIR SERVANTS AND FURNITURE, I THINK IS
BEST OBSERVED BY MEALS WITHIN DOORS. WHEN YOU ARE TIRED OF EATING
STRAWBERRIES IN THE GARDEN, THERE SHALL BE COLD MEAT IN THE HOUSE."

"WELL--AS YOU PLEASE; ONLY DON'T HAVE A GREAT SET OUT. AND, BY THE BYE,
CAN I OR MY HOUSEKEEPER BE OF ANY USE TO YOU WITH OUR OPINION?--PRAY BE
SINCERE, KNIGHTLEY. IF YOU WISH ME TO TALK TO MRS. HODGES, OR TO INSPECT
ANYTHING--"

"I HAVE NOT THE LEAST WISH FOR IT, I THANK YOU."

"WELL--BUT IF ANY DIFFICULTIES SHOULD ARISE, MY HOUSEKEEPER IS EXTREMELY
CLEVER."

"I WILL ANSWER FOR IT, THAT MINE THINKS HERSELF FULL AS CLEVER, AND
WOULD SPURN ANY BODY'S ASSISTANCE."

"I WISH WE HAD A DONKEY. THE THING WOULD BE FOR US ALL TO COME ON
DONKEYS, JANE, MISS BATES, AND ME--AND MY CARO SPOSO WALKING BY. I
REALLY MUST TALK TO HIM ABOUT PURCHASING A DONKEY. IN A COUNTRY LIFE
I CONCEIVE IT TO BE A SORT OF NECESSARY; FOR, LET A WOMAN HAVE EVER
SO MANY RESOURCES, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE FOR HER TO BE ALWAYS SHUT UP AT
HOME;--AND VERY LONG WALKS, YOU KNOW--IN SUMMER THERE IS DUST, AND IN
WINTER THERE IS DIRT."

"YOU WILL NOT FIND EITHER, BETWEEN DONWELL AND HIGHBURY. DONWELL LANE IS
NEVER DUSTY, AND NOW IT IS PERFECTLY DRY. COME ON A DONKEY, HOWEVER, IF
YOU PREFER IT. YOU CAN BORROW MRS. COLE'S. I WOULD WISH EVERY THING TO
BE AS MUCH TO YOUR TASTE AS POSSIBLE."

"THAT I AM SURE YOU WOULD. INDEED I DO YOU JUSTICE, MY GOOD FRIEND.
UNDER THAT PECULIAR SORT OF DRY, BLUNT MANNER, I KNOW YOU HAVE THE
WARMEST HEART. AS I TELL MR. E., YOU ARE A THOROUGH HUMOURIST.--YES,
BELIEVE ME, KNIGHTLEY, I AM FULLY SENSIBLE OF YOUR ATTENTION TO ME IN
THE WHOLE OF THIS SCHEME. YOU HAVE HIT UPON THE VERY THING TO PLEASE
ME."

MR. KNIGHTLEY HAD ANOTHER REASON FOR AVOIDING A TABLE IN THE SHADE. HE
WISHED TO PERSUADE MR. WOODHOUSE, AS WELL AS EMMA, TO JOIN THE PARTY;
AND HE KNEW THAT TO HAVE ANY OF THEM SITTING DOWN OUT OF DOORS TO
EAT WOULD INEVITABLY MAKE HIM ILL. MR. WOODHOUSE MUST NOT, UNDER THE
SPECIOUS PRETENCE OF A MORNING DRIVE, AND AN HOUR OR TWO SPENT AT
DONWELL, BE TEMPTED AWAY TO HIS MISERY.

HE WAS INVITED ON GOOD FAITH. NO LURKING HORRORS WERE TO UPBRAID HIM FOR
HIS EASY CREDULITY. HE DID CONSENT. HE HAD NOT BEEN AT DONWELL FOR TWO
YEARS. "SOME VERY FINE MORNING, HE, AND EMMA, AND HARRIET, COULD GO
VERY WELL; AND HE COULD SIT STILL WITH MRS. WESTON, WHILE THE DEAR GIRLS
WALKED ABOUT THE GARDENS. HE DID NOT SUPPOSE THEY COULD BE DAMP NOW,
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY. HE SHOULD LIKE TO SEE THE OLD HOUSE AGAIN
EXCEEDINGLY, AND SHOULD BE VERY HAPPY TO MEET MR. AND MRS. ELTON, AND
ANY OTHER OF HIS NEIGHBOURS.--HE COULD NOT SEE ANY OBJECTION AT ALL TO
HIS, AND EMMA'S, AND HARRIET'S GOING THERE SOME VERY FINE MORNING. HE
THOUGHT IT VERY WELL DONE OF MR. KNIGHTLEY TO INVITE THEM--VERY KIND
AND SENSIBLE--MUCH CLEVERER THAN DINING OUT.--HE WAS NOT FOND OF DINING
OUT."

MR. KNIGHTLEY WAS FORTUNATE IN EVERY BODY'S MOST READY CONCURRENCE. THE
INVITATION WAS EVERYWHERE SO WELL RECEIVED, THAT IT SEEMED AS IF, LIKE
MRS. ELTON, THEY WERE ALL TAKING THE SCHEME AS A PARTICULAR COMPLIMENT
TO THEMSELVES.--EMMA AND HARRIET PROFESSED VERY HIGH EXPECTATIONS OF
PLEASURE FROM IT; AND MR. WESTON, UNASKED, PROMISED TO GET FRANK OVER TO
JOIN THEM, IF POSSIBLE; A PROOF OF APPROBATION AND GRATITUDE WHICH COULD
HAVE BEEN DISPENSED WITH.--MR. KNIGHTLEY WAS THEN OBLIGED TO SAY THAT
HE SHOULD BE GLAD TO SEE HIM; AND MR. WESTON ENGAGED TO LOSE NO TIME IN
WRITING, AND SPARE NO ARGUMENTS TO INDUCE HIM TO COME.

IN THE MEANWHILE THE LAME HORSE RECOVERED SO FAST, THAT THE PARTY TO
BOX HILL WAS AGAIN UNDER HAPPY CONSIDERATION; AND AT LAST DONWELL WAS
SETTLED FOR ONE DAY, AND BOX HILL FOR THE NEXT,--THE WEATHER APPEARING
EXACTLY RIGHT.

UNDER A BRIGHT MID-DAY SUN, AT ALMOST MIDSUMMER, MR. WOODHOUSE WAS
SAFELY CONVEYED IN HIS CARRIAGE, WITH ONE WINDOW DOWN, TO PARTAKE OF
THIS AL-FRESCO PARTY; AND IN ONE OF THE MOST COMFORTABLE ROOMS IN THE
ABBEY, ESPECIALLY PREPARED FOR HIM BY A FIRE ALL THE MORNING, HE WAS
HAPPILY PLACED, QUITE AT HIS EASE, READY TO TALK WITH PLEASURE OF WHAT
HAD BEEN ACHIEVED, AND ADVISE EVERY BODY TO COME AND SIT DOWN, AND NOT
TO HEAT THEMSELVES.--MRS. WESTON, WHO SEEMED TO HAVE WALKED THERE ON
PURPOSE TO BE TIRED, AND SIT ALL THE TIME WITH HIM, REMAINED, WHEN
ALL THE OTHERS WERE INVITED OR PERSUADED OUT, HIS PATIENT LISTENER AND
SYMPATHISER.

IT WAS SO LONG SINCE EMMA HAD BEEN AT THE ABBEY, THAT AS SOON AS SHE WAS
SATISFIED OF HER FATHER'S COMFORT, SHE WAS GLAD TO LEAVE HIM, AND LOOK
AROUND HER; EAGER TO REFRESH AND CORRECT HER MEMORY WITH MORE PARTICULAR
OBSERVATION, MORE EXACT UNDERSTANDING OF A HOUSE AND GROUNDS WHICH MUST
EVER BE SO INTERESTING TO HER AND ALL HER FAMILY.

SHE FELT ALL THE HONEST PRIDE AND COMPLACENCY WHICH HER ALLIANCE WITH
THE PRESENT AND FUTURE PROPRIETOR COULD FAIRLY WARRANT, AS SHE VIEWED
THE RESPECTABLE SIZE AND STYLE OF THE BUILDING, ITS SUITABLE, BECOMING,
CHARACTERISTIC SITUATION, LOW AND SHELTERED--ITS AMPLE GARDENS
STRETCHING DOWN TO MEADOWS WASHED BY A STREAM, OF WHICH THE ABBEY, WITH
ALL THE OLD NEGLECT OF PROSPECT, HAD SCARCELY A SIGHT--AND ITS ABUNDANCE
OF TIMBER IN ROWS AND AVENUES, WHICH NEITHER FASHION NOR EXTRAVAGANCE
HAD ROOTED UP.--THE HOUSE WAS LARGER THAN HARTFIELD, AND TOTALLY UNLIKE
IT, COVERING A GOOD DEAL OF GROUND, RAMBLING AND IRREGULAR, WITH MANY
COMFORTABLE, AND ONE OR TWO HANDSOME ROOMS.--IT WAS JUST WHAT IT OUGHT
TO BE, AND IT LOOKED WHAT IT WAS--AND EMMA FELT AN INCREASING RESPECT
FOR IT, AS THE RESIDENCE OF A FAMILY OF SUCH TRUE GENTILITY, UNTAINTED
IN BLOOD AND UNDERSTANDING.--SOME FAULTS OF TEMPER JOHN KNIGHTLEY HAD;
BUT ISABELLA HAD CONNECTED HERSELF UNEXCEPTIONABLY. SHE HAD GIVEN THEM
NEITHER MEN, NOR NAMES, NOR PLACES, THAT COULD RAISE A BLUSH. THESE WERE
PLEASANT FEELINGS, AND SHE WALKED ABOUT AND INDULGED THEM TILL IT
WAS NECESSARY TO DO AS THE OTHERS DID, AND COLLECT ROUND THE
STRAWBERRY-BEDS.--THE WHOLE PARTY WERE ASSEMBLED, EXCEPTING FRANK
CHURCHILL, WHO WAS EXPECTED EVERY MOMENT FROM RICHMOND; AND MRS. ELTON,
IN ALL HER APPARATUS OF HAPPINESS, HER LARGE BONNET AND HER BASKET,
WAS VERY READY TO LEAD THE WAY IN GATHERING, ACCEPTING, OR
TALKING--STRAWBERRIES, AND ONLY STRAWBERRIES, COULD NOW BE THOUGHT OR
SPOKEN OF.--"THE BEST FRUIT IN ENGLAND--EVERY BODY'S FAVOURITE--ALWAYS
WHOLESOME.--THESE THE FINEST BEDS AND FINEST SORTS.--DELIGHTFUL TO
GATHER FOR ONE'S SELF--THE ONLY WAY OF REALLY ENJOYING THEM.--MORNING
DECIDEDLY THE BEST TIME--NEVER TIRED--EVERY SORT GOOD--HAUTBOY
INFINITELY SUPERIOR--NO COMPARISON--THE OTHERS HARDLY EATABLE--HAUTBOYS
VERY SCARCE--CHILI PREFERRED--WHITE WOOD FINEST FLAVOUR OF ALL--PRICE
OF STRAWBERRIES IN LONDON--ABUNDANCE ABOUT BRISTOL--MAPLE
GROVE--CULTIVATION--BEDS WHEN TO BE RENEWED--GARDENERS THINKING EXACTLY
DIFFERENT--NO GENERAL RULE--GARDENERS NEVER TO BE PUT OUT OF THEIR
WAY--DELICIOUS FRUIT--ONLY TOO RICH TO BE EATEN MUCH OF--INFERIOR
TO CHERRIES--CURRANTS MORE REFRESHING--ONLY OBJECTION TO GATHERING
STRAWBERRIES THE STOOPING--GLARING SUN--TIRED TO DEATH--COULD BEAR IT NO
LONGER--MUST GO AND SIT IN THE SHADE."

SUCH, FOR HALF AN HOUR, WAS THE CONVERSATION--INTERRUPTED ONLY ONCE BY
MRS. WESTON, WHO CAME OUT, IN HER SOLICITUDE AFTER HER SON-IN-LAW, TO
INQUIRE IF HE WERE COME--AND SHE WAS A LITTLE UNEASY.--SHE HAD SOME
FEARS OF HIS HORSE.

SEATS TOLERABLY IN THE SHADE WERE FOUND; AND NOW EMMA WAS OBLIGED
TO OVERHEAR WHAT MRS. ELTON AND JANE FAIRFAX WERE TALKING OF.--A
SITUATION, A MOST DESIRABLE SITUATION, WAS IN QUESTION. MRS. ELTON HAD
RECEIVED NOTICE OF IT THAT MORNING, AND WAS IN RAPTURES. IT WAS NOT
WITH MRS. SUCKLING, IT WAS NOT WITH MRS. BRAGGE, BUT IN FELICITY AND
SPLENDOUR IT FELL SHORT ONLY OF THEM: IT WAS WITH A COUSIN OF MRS.
BRAGGE, AN ACQUAINTANCE OF MRS. SUCKLING, A LADY KNOWN AT MAPLE GROVE.
DELIGHTFUL, CHARMING, SUPERIOR, FIRST CIRCLES, SPHERES, LINES, RANKS,
EVERY THING--AND MRS. ELTON WAS WILD TO HAVE THE OFFER CLOSED WITH
IMMEDIATELY.--ON HER SIDE, ALL WAS WARMTH, ENERGY, AND TRIUMPH--AND SHE
POSITIVELY REFUSED TO TAKE HER FRIEND'S NEGATIVE, THOUGH MISS FAIRFAX
CONTINUED TO ASSURE HER THAT SHE WOULD NOT AT PRESENT ENGAGE IN ANY
THING, REPEATING THE SAME MOTIVES WHICH SHE HAD BEEN HEARD TO URGE
BEFORE.--STILL MRS. ELTON INSISTED ON BEING AUTHORISED TO WRITE AN
ACQUIESCENCE BY THE MORROW'S POST.--HOW JANE COULD BEAR IT AT ALL, WAS
ASTONISHING TO EMMA.--SHE DID LOOK VEXED, SHE DID SPEAK POINTEDLY--AND
AT LAST, WITH A DECISION OF ACTION UNUSUAL TO HER, PROPOSED A
REMOVAL.--"SHOULD NOT THEY WALK? WOULD NOT MR. KNIGHTLEY SHEW THEM THE
GARDENS--ALL THE GARDENS?--SHE WISHED TO SEE THE WHOLE EXTENT."--THE
PERTINACITY OF HER FRIEND SEEMED MORE THAN SHE COULD BEAR.

IT WAS HOT; AND AFTER WALKING SOME TIME OVER THE GARDENS IN A SCATTERED,
DISPERSED WAY, SCARCELY ANY THREE TOGETHER, THEY INSENSIBLY FOLLOWED ONE
ANOTHER TO THE DELICIOUS SHADE OF A BROAD SHORT AVENUE OF LIMES, WHICH
STRETCHING BEYOND THE GARDEN AT AN EQUAL DISTANCE FROM THE RIVER, SEEMED
THE FINISH OF THE PLEASURE GROUNDS.--IT LED TO NOTHING; NOTHING BUT A
VIEW AT THE END OVER A LOW STONE WALL WITH HIGH PILLARS, WHICH SEEMED
INTENDED, IN THEIR ERECTION, TO GIVE THE APPEARANCE OF AN APPROACH TO
THE HOUSE, WHICH NEVER HAD BEEN THERE. DISPUTABLE, HOWEVER, AS MIGHT BE
THE TASTE OF SUCH A TERMINATION, IT WAS IN ITSELF A CHARMING WALK, AND
THE VIEW WHICH CLOSED IT EXTREMELY PRETTY.--THE CONSIDERABLE SLOPE, AT
NEARLY THE FOOT OF WHICH THE ABBEY STOOD, GRADUALLY ACQUIRED A STEEPER
FORM BEYOND ITS GROUNDS; AND AT HALF A MILE DISTANT WAS A BANK OF
CONSIDERABLE ABRUPTNESS AND GRANDEUR, WELL CLOTHED WITH WOOD;--AND AT
THE BOTTOM OF THIS BANK, FAVOURABLY PLACED AND SHELTERED, ROSE THE
ABBEY MILL FARM, WITH MEADOWS IN FRONT, AND THE RIVER MAKING A CLOSE AND
HANDSOME CURVE AROUND IT.

IT WAS A SWEET VIEW--SWEET TO THE EYE AND THE MIND. ENGLISH VERDURE,
ENGLISH CULTURE, ENGLISH COMFORT, SEEN UNDER A SUN BRIGHT, WITHOUT BEING
OPPRESSIVE.

IN THIS WALK EMMA AND MR. WESTON FOUND ALL THE OTHERS ASSEMBLED; AND
TOWARDS THIS VIEW SHE IMMEDIATELY PERCEIVED MR. KNIGHTLEY AND HARRIET
DISTINCT FROM THE REST, QUIETLY LEADING THE WAY. MR. KNIGHTLEY AND
HARRIET!--IT WAS AN ODD TETE-A-TETE; BUT SHE WAS GLAD TO SEE IT.--THERE
HAD BEEN A TIME WHEN HE WOULD HAVE SCORNED HER AS A COMPANION, AND
TURNED FROM HER WITH LITTLE CEREMONY. NOW THEY SEEMED IN PLEASANT
CONVERSATION. THERE HAD BEEN A TIME ALSO WHEN EMMA WOULD HAVE BEEN SORRY
TO SEE HARRIET IN A SPOT SO FAVOURABLE FOR THE ABBEY MILL FARM; BUT NOW
SHE FEARED IT NOT. IT MIGHT BE SAFELY VIEWED WITH ALL ITS APPENDAGES OF
PROSPERITY AND BEAUTY, ITS RICH PASTURES, SPREADING FLOCKS, ORCHARD IN
BLOSSOM, AND LIGHT COLUMN OF SMOKE ASCENDING.--SHE JOINED THEM AT THE
WALL, AND FOUND THEM MORE ENGAGED IN TALKING THAN IN LOOKING AROUND. HE
WAS GIVING HARRIET INFORMATION AS TO MODES OF AGRICULTURE, ETC. AND EMMA
RECEIVED A SMILE WHICH SEEMED TO SAY, "THESE ARE MY OWN CONCERNS. I HAVE
A RIGHT TO TALK ON SUCH SUBJECTS, WITHOUT BEING SUSPECTED OF
INTRODUCING ROBERT MARTIN."--SHE DID NOT SUSPECT HIM. IT WAS TOO OLD
A STORY.--ROBERT MARTIN HAD PROBABLY CEASED TO THINK OF HARRIET.--THEY
TOOK A FEW TURNS TOGETHER ALONG THE WALK.--THE SHADE WAS MOST
REFRESHING, AND EMMA FOUND IT THE PLEASANTEST PART OF THE DAY.

THE NEXT REMOVE WAS TO THE HOUSE; THEY MUST ALL GO IN AND EAT;--AND THEY
WERE ALL SEATED AND BUSY, AND STILL FRANK CHURCHILL DID NOT COME. MRS.
WESTON LOOKED, AND LOOKED IN VAIN. HIS FATHER WOULD NOT OWN HIMSELF
UNEASY, AND LAUGHED AT HER FEARS; BUT SHE COULD NOT BE CURED OF WISHING
THAT HE WOULD PART WITH HIS BLACK MARE. HE HAD EXPRESSED HIMSELF AS TO
COMING, WITH MORE THAN COMMON CERTAINTY. "HIS AUNT WAS SO MUCH BETTER,
THAT HE HAD NOT A DOUBT OF GETTING OVER TO THEM."--MRS. CHURCHILL'S
STATE, HOWEVER, AS MANY WERE READY TO REMIND HER, WAS LIABLE TO SUCH
SUDDEN VARIATION AS MIGHT DISAPPOINT HER NEPHEW IN THE MOST REASONABLE
DEPENDENCE--AND MRS. WESTON WAS AT LAST PERSUADED TO BELIEVE, OR TO SAY,
THAT IT MUST BE BY SOME ATTACK OF MRS. CHURCHILL THAT HE WAS
PREVENTED COMING.--EMMA LOOKED AT HARRIET WHILE THE POINT WAS UNDER
CONSIDERATION; SHE BEHAVED VERY WELL, AND BETRAYED NO EMOTION.

THE COLD REPAST WAS OVER, AND THE PARTY WERE TO GO OUT ONCE MORE TO SEE
WHAT HAD NOT YET BEEN SEEN, THE OLD ABBEY FISH-PONDS; PERHAPS GET AS FAR
AS THE CLOVER, WHICH WAS TO BE BEGUN CUTTING ON THE MORROW, OR, AT
ANY RATE, HAVE THE PLEASURE OF BEING HOT, AND GROWING COOL AGAIN.--MR.
WOODHOUSE, WHO HAD ALREADY TAKEN HIS LITTLE ROUND IN THE HIGHEST PART
OF THE GARDENS, WHERE NO DAMPS FROM THE RIVER WERE IMAGINED EVEN BY HIM,
STIRRED NO MORE; AND HIS DAUGHTER RESOLVED TO REMAIN WITH HIM, THAT
MRS. WESTON MIGHT BE PERSUADED AWAY BY HER HUSBAND TO THE EXERCISE AND
VARIETY WHICH HER SPIRITS SEEMED TO NEED.

MR. KNIGHTLEY HAD DONE ALL IN HIS POWER FOR MR. WOODHOUSE'S
ENTERTAINMENT. BOOKS OF ENGRAVINGS, DRAWERS OF MEDALS, CAMEOS, CORALS,
SHELLS, AND EVERY OTHER FAMILY COLLECTION WITHIN HIS CABINETS, HAD BEEN
PREPARED FOR HIS OLD FRIEND, TO WHILE AWAY THE MORNING; AND THE KINDNESS
HAD PERFECTLY ANSWERED. MR. WOODHOUSE HAD BEEN EXCEEDINGLY WELL AMUSED.
MRS. WESTON HAD BEEN SHEWING THEM ALL TO HIM, AND NOW HE WOULD SHEW THEM
ALL TO EMMA;--FORTUNATE IN HAVING NO OTHER RESEMBLANCE TO A CHILD, THAN
IN A TOTAL WANT OF TASTE FOR WHAT HE SAW, FOR HE WAS SLOW, CONSTANT, AND
METHODICAL.--BEFORE THIS SECOND LOOKING OVER WAS BEGUN, HOWEVER, EMMA
WALKED INTO THE HALL FOR THE SAKE OF A FEW MOMENTS' FREE OBSERVATION OF
THE ENTRANCE AND GROUND-PLOT OF THE HOUSE--AND WAS HARDLY THERE, WHEN
JANE FAIRFAX APPEARED, COMING QUICKLY IN FROM THE GARDEN, AND WITH A
LOOK OF ESCAPE.--LITTLE EXPECTING TO MEET MISS WOODHOUSE SO SOON, THERE
WAS A START AT FIRST; BUT MISS WOODHOUSE WAS THE VERY PERSON SHE WAS IN
QUEST OF.

"WILL YOU BE SO KIND," SAID SHE, "WHEN I AM MISSED, AS TO SAY THAT I AM
GONE HOME?--I AM GOING THIS MOMENT.--MY AUNT IS NOT AWARE HOW LATE IT
IS, NOR HOW LONG WE HAVE BEEN ABSENT--BUT I AM SURE WE SHALL BE WANTED,
AND I AM DETERMINED TO GO DIRECTLY.--I HAVE SAID NOTHING ABOUT IT TO ANY
BODY. IT WOULD ONLY BE GIVING TROUBLE AND DISTRESS. SOME ARE GONE TO THE
PONDS, AND SOME TO THE LIME WALK. TILL THEY ALL COME IN I SHALL NOT BE
MISSED; AND WHEN THEY DO, WILL YOU HAVE THE GOODNESS TO SAY THAT I AM
GONE?"

"CERTAINLY, IF YOU WISH IT;--BUT YOU ARE NOT GOING TO WALK TO HIGHBURY
ALONE?"

"YES--WHAT SHOULD HURT ME?--I WALK FAST. I SHALL BE AT HOME IN TWENTY
MINUTES."

"BUT IT IS TOO FAR, INDEED IT IS, TO BE WALKING QUITE ALONE. LET MY
FATHER'S SERVANT GO WITH YOU.--LET ME ORDER THE CARRIAGE. IT CAN BE
ROUND IN FIVE MINUTES."

"THANK YOU, THANK YOU--BUT ON NO ACCOUNT.--I WOULD RATHER WALK.--AND
FOR ME TO BE AFRAID OF WALKING ALONE!--I, WHO MAY SO SOON HAVE TO
GUARD OTHERS!"

SHE SPOKE WITH GREAT AGITATION; AND EMMA VERY FEELINGLY REPLIED, "THAT
CAN BE NO REASON FOR YOUR BEING EXPOSED TO DANGER NOW. I MUST ORDER THE
CARRIAGE. THE HEAT EVEN WOULD BE DANGER.--YOU ARE FATIGUED ALREADY."

"I AM,"--SHE ANSWERED--"I AM FATIGUED; BUT IT IS NOT THE SORT OF
FATIGUE--QUICK WALKING WILL REFRESH ME.--MISS WOODHOUSE, WE ALL KNOW
AT TIMES WHAT IT IS TO BE WEARIED IN SPIRITS. MINE, I CONFESS, ARE
EXHAUSTED. THE GREATEST KINDNESS YOU CAN SHEW ME, WILL BE TO LET ME HAVE
MY OWN WAY, AND ONLY SAY THAT I AM GONE WHEN IT IS NECESSARY."

EMMA HAD NOT ANOTHER WORD TO OPPOSE. SHE SAW IT ALL; AND ENTERING INTO
HER FEELINGS, PROMOTED HER QUITTING THE HOUSE IMMEDIATELY, AND
WATCHED HER SAFELY OFF WITH THE ZEAL OF A FRIEND. HER PARTING LOOK WAS
GRATEFUL--AND HER PARTING WORDS, "OH! MISS WOODHOUSE, THE COMFORT OF
BEING SOMETIMES ALONE!"--SEEMED TO BURST FROM AN OVERCHARGED HEART, AND
TO DESCRIBE SOMEWHAT OF THE CONTINUAL ENDURANCE TO BE PRACTISED BY HER,
EVEN TOWARDS SOME OF THOSE WHO LOVED HER BEST.

"SUCH A HOME, INDEED! SUCH AN AUNT!" SAID EMMA, AS SHE TURNED BACK INTO
THE HALL AGAIN. "I DO PITY YOU. AND THE MORE SENSIBILITY YOU BETRAY OF
THEIR JUST HORRORS, THE MORE I SHALL LIKE YOU."

JANE HAD NOT BEEN GONE A QUARTER OF AN HOUR, AND THEY HAD ONLY
ACCOMPLISHED SOME VIEWS OF ST. MARK'S PLACE, VENICE, WHEN FRANK
CHURCHILL ENTERED THE ROOM. EMMA HAD NOT BEEN THINKING OF HIM, SHE HAD
FORGOTTEN TO THINK OF HIM--BUT SHE WAS VERY GLAD TO SEE HIM. MRS. WESTON
WOULD BE AT EASE. THE BLACK MARE WAS BLAMELESS; THEY WERE RIGHT
WHO HAD NAMED MRS. CHURCHILL AS THE CAUSE. HE HAD BEEN DETAINED BY
A TEMPORARY INCREASE OF ILLNESS IN HER; A NERVOUS SEIZURE, WHICH HAD
LASTED SOME HOURS--AND HE HAD QUITE GIVEN UP EVERY THOUGHT OF COMING,
TILL VERY LATE;--AND HAD HE KNOWN HOW HOT A RIDE HE SHOULD HAVE, AND
HOW LATE, WITH ALL HIS HURRY, HE MUST BE, HE BELIEVED HE SHOULD NOT HAVE
COME AT ALL. THE HEAT WAS EXCESSIVE; HE HAD NEVER SUFFERED ANY THING
LIKE IT--ALMOST WISHED HE HAD STAID AT HOME--NOTHING KILLED HIM
LIKE HEAT--HE COULD BEAR ANY DEGREE OF COLD, ETC., BUT HEAT WAS
INTOLERABLE--AND HE SAT DOWN, AT THE GREATEST POSSIBLE DISTANCE FROM THE
SLIGHT REMAINS OF MR. WOODHOUSE'S FIRE, LOOKING VERY DEPLORABLE.

"YOU WILL SOON BE COOLER, IF YOU SIT STILL," SAID EMMA.

"AS SOON AS I AM COOLER I SHALL GO BACK AGAIN. I COULD VERY ILL BE
SPARED--BUT SUCH A POINT HAD BEEN MADE OF MY COMING! YOU WILL ALL BE
GOING SOON I SUPPOSE; THE WHOLE PARTY BREAKING UP. I MET ONE AS I
CAME--MADNESS IN SUCH WEATHER!--ABSOLUTE MADNESS!"

EMMA LISTENED, AND LOOKED, AND SOON PERCEIVED THAT FRANK CHURCHILL'S
STATE MIGHT BE BEST DEFINED BY THE EXPRESSIVE PHRASE OF BEING OUT OF
HUMOUR. SOME PEOPLE WERE ALWAYS CROSS WHEN THEY WERE HOT. SUCH MIGHT BE
HIS CONSTITUTION; AND AS SHE KNEW THAT EATING AND DRINKING WERE OFTEN
THE CURE OF SUCH INCIDENTAL COMPLAINTS, SHE RECOMMENDED HIS TAKING
SOME REFRESHMENT; HE WOULD FIND ABUNDANCE OF EVERY THING IN THE
DINING-ROOM--AND SHE HUMANELY POINTED OUT THE DOOR.

"NO--HE SHOULD NOT EAT. HE WAS NOT HUNGRY; IT WOULD ONLY MAKE HIM
HOTTER." IN TWO MINUTES, HOWEVER, HE RELENTED IN HIS OWN FAVOUR; AND
MUTTERING SOMETHING ABOUT SPRUCE-BEER, WALKED OFF. EMMA RETURNED ALL HER
ATTENTION TO HER FATHER, SAYING IN SECRET--

"I AM GLAD I HAVE DONE BEING IN LOVE WITH HIM. I SHOULD NOT LIKE A MAN
WHO IS SO SOON DISCOMPOSED BY A HOT MORNING. HARRIET'S SWEET EASY TEMPER
WILL NOT MIND IT."

HE WAS GONE LONG ENOUGH TO HAVE HAD A VERY COMFORTABLE MEAL, AND CAME
BACK ALL THE BETTER--GROWN QUITE COOL--AND, WITH GOOD MANNERS, LIKE
HIMSELF--ABLE TO DRAW A CHAIR CLOSE TO THEM, TAKE AN INTEREST IN THEIR
EMPLOYMENT; AND REGRET, IN A REASONABLE WAY, THAT HE SHOULD BE SO LATE.
HE WAS NOT IN HIS BEST SPIRITS, BUT SEEMED TRYING TO IMPROVE THEM; AND,
AT LAST, MADE HIMSELF TALK NONSENSE VERY AGREEABLY. THEY WERE LOOKING
OVER VIEWS IN SWISSERLAND.

"AS SOON AS MY AUNT GETS WELL, I SHALL GO ABROAD," SAID HE. "I SHALL
NEVER BE EASY TILL I HAVE SEEN SOME OF THESE PLACES. YOU WILL HAVE MY
SKETCHES, SOME TIME OR OTHER, TO LOOK AT--OR MY TOUR TO READ--OR MY
POEM. I SHALL DO SOMETHING TO EXPOSE MYSELF."

"THAT MAY BE--BUT NOT BY SKETCHES IN SWISSERLAND. YOU WILL NEVER GO TO
SWISSERLAND. YOUR UNCLE AND AUNT WILL NEVER ALLOW YOU TO LEAVE ENGLAND."

"THEY MAY BE INDUCED TO GO TOO. A WARM CLIMATE MAY BE PRESCRIBED FOR
HER. I HAVE MORE THAN HALF AN EXPECTATION OF OUR ALL GOING ABROAD. I
ASSURE YOU I HAVE. I FEEL A STRONG PERSUASION, THIS MORNING, THAT I
SHALL SOON BE ABROAD. I OUGHT TO TRAVEL. I AM TIRED OF DOING NOTHING. I
WANT A CHANGE. I AM SERIOUS, MISS WOODHOUSE, WHATEVER YOUR PENETRATING
EYES MAY FANCY--I AM SICK OF ENGLAND--AND WOULD LEAVE IT TO-MORROW, IF
I COULD."

"YOU ARE SICK OF PROSPERITY AND INDULGENCE. CANNOT YOU INVENT A FEW
HARDSHIPS FOR YOURSELF, AND BE CONTENTED TO STAY?"

"I SICK OF PROSPERITY AND INDULGENCE! YOU ARE QUITE MISTAKEN. I DO
NOT LOOK UPON MYSELF AS EITHER PROSPEROUS OR INDULGED. I AM THWARTED
IN EVERY THING MATERIAL. I DO NOT CONSIDER MYSELF AT ALL A FORTUNATE
PERSON."

"YOU ARE NOT QUITE SO MISERABLE, THOUGH, AS WHEN YOU FIRST CAME. GO AND
EAT AND DRINK A LITTLE MORE, AND YOU WILL DO VERY WELL. ANOTHER SLICE OF
COLD MEAT, ANOTHER DRAUGHT OF MADEIRA AND WATER, WILL MAKE YOU NEARLY ON
A PAR WITH THE REST OF US."

"NO--I SHALL NOT STIR. I SHALL SIT BY YOU. YOU ARE MY BEST CURE."

"WE ARE GOING TO BOX HILL TO-MORROW;--YOU WILL JOIN US. IT IS NOT
SWISSERLAND, BUT IT WILL BE SOMETHING FOR A YOUNG MAN SO MUCH IN WANT OF
A CHANGE. YOU WILL STAY, AND GO WITH US?"

"NO, CERTAINLY NOT; I SHALL GO HOME IN THE COOL OF THE EVENING."

"BUT YOU MAY COME AGAIN IN THE COOL OF TO-MORROW MORNING."

"NO--IT WILL NOT BE WORTH WHILE. IF I COME, I SHALL BE CROSS."

"THEN PRAY STAY AT RICHMOND."

"BUT IF I DO, I SHALL BE CROSSER STILL. I CAN NEVER BEAR TO THINK OF YOU
ALL THERE WITHOUT ME."

"THESE ARE DIFFICULTIES WHICH YOU MUST SETTLE FOR YOURSELF. CHUSE YOUR
OWN DEGREE OF CROSSNESS. I SHALL PRESS YOU NO MORE."

THE REST OF THE PARTY WERE NOW RETURNING, AND ALL WERE SOON COLLECTED.
WITH SOME THERE WAS GREAT JOY AT THE SIGHT OF FRANK CHURCHILL; OTHERS
TOOK IT VERY COMPOSEDLY; BUT THERE WAS A VERY GENERAL DISTRESS AND
DISTURBANCE ON MISS FAIRFAX'S DISAPPEARANCE BEING EXPLAINED. THAT IT WAS
TIME FOR EVERY BODY TO GO, CONCLUDED THE SUBJECT; AND WITH A SHORT FINAL
ARRANGEMENT FOR THE NEXT DAY'S SCHEME, THEY PARTED. FRANK CHURCHILL'S
LITTLE INCLINATION TO EXCLUDE HIMSELF INCREASED SO MUCH, THAT HIS LAST
WORDS TO EMMA WERE,

"WELL;--IF YOU WISH ME TO STAY AND JOIN THE PARTY, I WILL."

SHE SMILED HER ACCEPTANCE; AND NOTHING LESS THAN A SUMMONS FROM RICHMOND
WAS TO TAKE HIM BACK BEFORE THE FOLLOWING EVENING.



CHAPTER VII


THEY HAD A VERY FINE DAY FOR BOX HILL; AND ALL THE OTHER OUTWARD
CIRCUMSTANCES OF ARRANGEMENT, ACCOMMODATION, AND PUNCTUALITY, WERE IN
FAVOUR OF A PLEASANT PARTY. MR. WESTON DIRECTED THE WHOLE, OFFICIATING
SAFELY BETWEEN HARTFIELD AND THE VICARAGE, AND EVERY BODY WAS IN GOOD
TIME. EMMA AND HARRIET WENT TOGETHER; MISS BATES AND HER NIECE, WITH
THE ELTONS; THE GENTLEMEN ON HORSEBACK. MRS. WESTON REMAINED WITH MR.
WOODHOUSE. NOTHING WAS WANTING BUT TO BE HAPPY WHEN THEY GOT THERE.
SEVEN MILES WERE TRAVELLED IN EXPECTATION OF ENJOYMENT, AND EVERY BODY
HAD A BURST OF ADMIRATION ON FIRST ARRIVING; BUT IN THE GENERAL AMOUNT
OF THE DAY THERE WAS DEFICIENCY. THERE WAS A LANGUOR, A WANT OF SPIRITS,
A WANT OF UNION, WHICH COULD NOT BE GOT OVER. THEY SEPARATED TOO MUCH
INTO PARTIES. THE ELTONS WALKED TOGETHER; MR. KNIGHTLEY TOOK CHARGE OF
MISS BATES AND JANE; AND EMMA AND HARRIET BELONGED TO FRANK CHURCHILL.
AND MR. WESTON TRIED, IN VAIN, TO MAKE THEM HARMONISE BETTER. IT SEEMED
AT FIRST AN ACCIDENTAL DIVISION, BUT IT NEVER MATERIALLY VARIED. MR. AND
MRS. ELTON, INDEED, SHEWED NO UNWILLINGNESS TO MIX, AND BE AS AGREEABLE
AS THEY COULD; BUT DURING THE TWO WHOLE HOURS THAT WERE SPENT ON THE
HILL, THERE SEEMED A PRINCIPLE OF SEPARATION, BETWEEN THE OTHER PARTIES,
TOO STRONG FOR ANY FINE PROSPECTS, OR ANY COLD COLLATION, OR ANY
CHEERFUL MR. WESTON, TO REMOVE.

AT FIRST IT WAS DOWNRIGHT DULNESS TO EMMA. SHE HAD NEVER SEEN FRANK
CHURCHILL SO SILENT AND STUPID. HE SAID NOTHING WORTH HEARING--LOOKED
WITHOUT SEEING--ADMIRED WITHOUT INTELLIGENCE--LISTENED WITHOUT KNOWING
WHAT SHE SAID. WHILE HE WAS SO DULL, IT WAS NO WONDER THAT HARRIET
SHOULD BE DULL LIKEWISE; AND THEY WERE BOTH INSUFFERABLE.

WHEN THEY ALL SAT DOWN IT WAS BETTER; TO HER TASTE A GREAT DEAL BETTER,
FOR FRANK CHURCHILL GREW TALKATIVE AND GAY, MAKING HER HIS FIRST OBJECT.
EVERY DISTINGUISHING ATTENTION THAT COULD BE PAID, WAS PAID TO HER.
TO AMUSE HER, AND BE AGREEABLE IN HER EYES, SEEMED ALL THAT HE CARED
FOR--AND EMMA, GLAD TO BE ENLIVENED, NOT SORRY TO BE FLATTERED, WAS GAY
AND EASY TOO, AND GAVE HIM ALL THE FRIENDLY ENCOURAGEMENT, THE ADMISSION
TO BE GALLANT, WHICH SHE HAD EVER GIVEN IN THE FIRST AND MOST ANIMATING
PERIOD OF THEIR ACQUAINTANCE; BUT WHICH NOW, IN HER OWN ESTIMATION,
MEANT NOTHING, THOUGH IN THE JUDGMENT OF MOST PEOPLE LOOKING ON IT MUST
HAVE HAD SUCH AN APPEARANCE AS NO ENGLISH WORD BUT FLIRTATION COULD VERY
WELL DESCRIBE. "MR. FRANK CHURCHILL AND MISS WOODHOUSE FLIRTED TOGETHER
EXCESSIVELY." THEY WERE LAYING THEMSELVES OPEN TO THAT VERY PHRASE--AND
TO HAVING IT SENT OFF IN A LETTER TO MAPLE GROVE BY ONE LADY, TO
IRELAND BY ANOTHER. NOT THAT EMMA WAS GAY AND THOUGHTLESS FROM ANY
REAL FELICITY; IT WAS RATHER BECAUSE SHE FELT LESS HAPPY THAN SHE HAD
EXPECTED. SHE LAUGHED BECAUSE SHE WAS DISAPPOINTED; AND THOUGH SHE LIKED
HIM FOR HIS ATTENTIONS, AND THOUGHT THEM ALL, WHETHER IN FRIENDSHIP,
ADMIRATION, OR PLAYFULNESS, EXTREMELY JUDICIOUS, THEY WERE NOT WINNING
BACK HER HEART. SHE STILL INTENDED HIM FOR HER FRIEND.

"HOW MUCH I AM OBLIGED TO YOU," SAID HE, "FOR TELLING ME TO COME
TO-DAY!--IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR YOU, I SHOULD CERTAINLY HAVE LOST ALL
THE HAPPINESS OF THIS PARTY. I HAD QUITE DETERMINED TO GO AWAY AGAIN."

"YES, YOU WERE VERY CROSS; AND I DO NOT KNOW WHAT ABOUT, EXCEPT THAT YOU
WERE TOO LATE FOR THE BEST STRAWBERRIES. I WAS A KINDER FRIEND THAN YOU
DESERVED. BUT YOU WERE HUMBLE. YOU BEGGED HARD TO BE COMMANDED TO COME."

"DON'T SAY I WAS CROSS. I WAS FATIGUED. THE HEAT OVERCAME ME."

"IT IS HOTTER TO-DAY."

"NOT TO MY FEELINGS. I AM PERFECTLY COMFORTABLE TO-DAY."

"YOU ARE COMFORTABLE BECAUSE YOU ARE UNDER COMMAND."

"YOUR COMMAND?--YES."

"PERHAPS I INTENDED YOU TO SAY SO, BUT I MEANT SELF-COMMAND. YOU HAD,
SOMEHOW OR OTHER, BROKEN BOUNDS YESTERDAY, AND RUN AWAY FROM YOUR OWN
MANAGEMENT; BUT TO-DAY YOU ARE GOT BACK AGAIN--AND AS I CANNOT BE ALWAYS
WITH YOU, IT IS BEST TO BELIEVE YOUR TEMPER UNDER YOUR OWN COMMAND
RATHER THAN MINE."

"IT COMES TO THE SAME THING. I CAN HAVE NO SELF-COMMAND WITHOUT A
MOTIVE. YOU ORDER ME, WHETHER YOU SPEAK OR NOT. AND YOU CAN BE ALWAYS
WITH ME. YOU ARE ALWAYS WITH ME."

"DATING FROM THREE O'CLOCK YESTERDAY. MY PERPETUAL INFLUENCE COULD NOT
BEGIN EARLIER, OR YOU WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SO MUCH OUT OF HUMOUR BEFORE."

"THREE O'CLOCK YESTERDAY! THAT IS YOUR DATE. I THOUGHT I HAD SEEN YOU
FIRST IN FEBRUARY."

"YOUR GALLANTRY IS REALLY UNANSWERABLE. BUT (LOWERING HER VOICE)--NOBODY
SPEAKS EXCEPT OURSELVES, AND IT IS RATHER TOO MUCH TO BE TALKING
NONSENSE FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT OF SEVEN SILENT PEOPLE."

"I SAY NOTHING OF WHICH I AM ASHAMED," REPLIED HE, WITH LIVELY
IMPUDENCE. "I SAW YOU FIRST IN FEBRUARY. LET EVERY BODY ON THE HILL
HEAR ME IF THEY CAN. LET MY ACCENTS SWELL TO MICKLEHAM ON ONE SIDE,
AND DORKING ON THE OTHER. I SAW YOU FIRST IN FEBRUARY." AND THEN
WHISPERING--"OUR COMPANIONS ARE EXCESSIVELY STUPID. WHAT SHALL WE DO
TO ROUSE THEM? ANY NONSENSE WILL SERVE. THEY SHALL TALK. LADIES
AND GENTLEMEN, I AM ORDERED BY MISS WOODHOUSE (WHO, WHEREVER SHE IS,
PRESIDES) TO SAY, THAT SHE DESIRES TO KNOW WHAT YOU ARE ALL THINKING
OF?"

SOME LAUGHED, AND ANSWERED GOOD-HUMOUREDLY. MISS BATES SAID A GREAT
DEAL; MRS. ELTON SWELLED AT THE IDEA OF MISS WOODHOUSE'S PRESIDING; MR.
KNIGHTLEY'S ANSWER WAS THE MOST DISTINCT.

"IS MISS WOODHOUSE SURE THAT SHE WOULD LIKE TO HEAR WHAT WE ARE ALL
THINKING OF?"

"OH! NO, NO"--CRIED EMMA, LAUGHING AS CARELESSLY AS SHE COULD--"UPON NO
ACCOUNT IN THE WORLD. IT IS THE VERY LAST THING I WOULD STAND THE BRUNT
OF JUST NOW. LET ME HEAR ANY THING RATHER THAN WHAT YOU ARE ALL THINKING
OF. I WILL NOT SAY QUITE ALL. THERE ARE ONE OR TWO, PERHAPS, (GLANCING
AT MR. WESTON AND HARRIET,) WHOSE THOUGHTS I MIGHT NOT BE AFRAID OF
KNOWING."

"IT IS A SORT OF THING," CRIED MRS. ELTON EMPHATICALLY, "WHICH I
SHOULD NOT HAVE THOUGHT MYSELF PRIVILEGED TO INQUIRE INTO. THOUGH,
PERHAPS, AS THE CHAPERON OF THE PARTY--I NEVER WAS IN ANY
CIRCLE--EXPLORING PARTIES--YOUNG LADIES--MARRIED WOMEN--"

HER MUTTERINGS WERE CHIEFLY TO HER HUSBAND; AND HE MURMURED, IN REPLY,

"VERY TRUE, MY LOVE, VERY TRUE. EXACTLY SO, INDEED--QUITE UNHEARD
OF--BUT SOME LADIES SAY ANY THING. BETTER PASS IT OFF AS A JOKE. EVERY
BODY KNOWS WHAT IS DUE TO YOU."

"IT WILL NOT DO," WHISPERED FRANK TO EMMA; "THEY ARE MOST OF THEM
AFFRONTED. I WILL ATTACK THEM WITH MORE ADDRESS. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN--I
AM ORDERED BY MISS WOODHOUSE TO SAY, THAT SHE WAIVES HER RIGHT OF
KNOWING EXACTLY WHAT YOU MAY ALL BE THINKING OF, AND ONLY REQUIRES
SOMETHING VERY ENTERTAINING FROM EACH OF YOU, IN A GENERAL WAY. HERE
ARE SEVEN OF YOU, BESIDES MYSELF, (WHO, SHE IS PLEASED TO SAY, AM VERY
ENTERTAINING ALREADY,) AND SHE ONLY DEMANDS FROM EACH OF YOU EITHER ONE
THING VERY CLEVER, BE IT PROSE OR VERSE, ORIGINAL OR REPEATED--OR TWO
THINGS MODERATELY CLEVER--OR THREE THINGS VERY DULL INDEED, AND SHE
ENGAGES TO LAUGH HEARTILY AT THEM ALL."

"OH! VERY WELL," EXCLAIMED MISS BATES, "THEN I NEED NOT BE UNEASY.
'THREE THINGS VERY DULL INDEED.' THAT WILL JUST DO FOR ME, YOU KNOW. I
SHALL BE SURE TO SAY THREE DULL THINGS AS SOON AS EVER I OPEN MY MOUTH,
SHAN'T I? (LOOKING ROUND WITH THE MOST GOOD-HUMOURED DEPENDENCE ON EVERY
BODY'S ASSENT)--DO NOT YOU ALL THINK I SHALL?"

EMMA COULD NOT RESIST.

"AH! MA'AM, BUT THERE MAY BE A DIFFICULTY. PARDON ME--BUT YOU WILL BE
LIMITED AS TO NUMBER--ONLY THREE AT ONCE."

MISS BATES, DECEIVED BY THE MOCK CEREMONY OF HER MANNER, DID NOT
IMMEDIATELY CATCH HER MEANING; BUT, WHEN IT BURST ON HER, IT COULD NOT
ANGER, THOUGH A SLIGHT BLUSH SHEWED THAT IT COULD PAIN HER.

"AH!--WELL--TO BE SURE. YES, I SEE WHAT SHE MEANS, (TURNING TO MR.
KNIGHTLEY,) AND I WILL TRY TO HOLD MY TONGUE. I MUST MAKE MYSELF VERY
DISAGREEABLE, OR SHE WOULD NOT HAVE SAID SUCH A THING TO AN OLD FRIEND."

"I LIKE YOUR PLAN," CRIED MR. WESTON. "AGREED, AGREED. I WILL DO MY
BEST. I AM MAKING A CONUNDRUM. HOW WILL A CONUNDRUM RECKON?"

"LOW, I AM AFRAID, SIR, VERY LOW," ANSWERED HIS SON;--"BUT WE SHALL BE
INDULGENT--ESPECIALLY TO ANY ONE WHO LEADS THE WAY."

"NO, NO," SAID EMMA, "IT WILL NOT RECKON LOW. A CONUNDRUM OF MR.
WESTON'S SHALL CLEAR HIM AND HIS NEXT NEIGHBOUR. COME, SIR, PRAY LET ME
HEAR IT."

"I DOUBT ITS BEING VERY CLEVER MYSELF," SAID MR. WESTON. "IT IS TOO MUCH
A MATTER OF FACT, BUT HERE IT IS.--WHAT TWO LETTERS OF THE ALPHABET ARE
THERE, THAT EXPRESS PERFECTION?"

"WHAT TWO LETTERS!--EXPRESS PERFECTION! I AM SURE I DO NOT KNOW."

"AH! YOU WILL NEVER GUESS. YOU, (TO EMMA), I AM CERTAIN, WILL NEVER
GUESS.--I WILL TELL YOU.--M. AND A.--EM-MA.--DO YOU UNDERSTAND?"

UNDERSTANDING AND GRATIFICATION CAME TOGETHER. IT MIGHT BE A VERY
INDIFFERENT PIECE OF WIT, BUT EMMA FOUND A GREAT DEAL TO LAUGH AT AND
ENJOY IN IT--AND SO DID FRANK AND HARRIET.--IT DID NOT SEEM TO TOUCH
THE REST OF THE PARTY EQUALLY; SOME LOOKED VERY STUPID ABOUT IT, AND MR.
KNIGHTLEY GRAVELY SAID,

"THIS EXPLAINS THE SORT OF CLEVER THING THAT IS WANTED, AND MR. WESTON
HAS DONE VERY WELL FOR HIMSELF; BUT HE MUST HAVE KNOCKED UP EVERY BODY
ELSE. PERFECTION SHOULD NOT HAVE COME QUITE SO SOON."

"OH! FOR MYSELF, I PROTEST I MUST BE EXCUSED," SAID MRS. ELTON; "I
REALLY CANNOT ATTEMPT--I AM NOT AT ALL FOND OF THE SORT OF THING. I HAD
AN ACROSTIC ONCE SENT TO ME UPON MY OWN NAME, WHICH I WAS NOT AT ALL
PLEASED WITH. I KNEW WHO IT CAME FROM. AN ABOMINABLE PUPPY!--YOU KNOW
WHO I MEAN (NODDING TO HER HUSBAND). THESE KIND OF THINGS ARE VERY
WELL AT CHRISTMAS, WHEN ONE IS SITTING ROUND THE FIRE; BUT QUITE OUT OF
PLACE, IN MY OPINION, WHEN ONE IS EXPLORING ABOUT THE COUNTRY IN SUMMER.
MISS WOODHOUSE MUST EXCUSE ME. I AM NOT ONE OF THOSE WHO HAVE WITTY
THINGS AT EVERY BODY'S SERVICE. I DO NOT PRETEND TO BE A WIT. I HAVE A
GREAT DEAL OF VIVACITY IN MY OWN WAY, BUT I REALLY MUST BE ALLOWED TO
JUDGE WHEN TO SPEAK AND WHEN TO HOLD MY TONGUE. PASS US, IF YOU PLEASE,
MR. CHURCHILL. PASS MR. E., KNIGHTLEY, JANE, AND MYSELF. WE HAVE NOTHING
CLEVER TO SAY--NOT ONE OF US.

"YES, YES, PRAY PASS ME," ADDED HER HUSBAND, WITH A SORT OF SNEERING
CONSCIOUSNESS; "I HAVE NOTHING TO SAY THAT CAN ENTERTAIN MISS
WOODHOUSE, OR ANY OTHER YOUNG LADY. AN OLD MARRIED MAN--QUITE GOOD FOR
NOTHING. SHALL WE WALK, AUGUSTA?"

"WITH ALL MY HEART. I AM REALLY TIRED OF EXPLORING SO LONG ON ONE SPOT.
COME, JANE, TAKE MY OTHER ARM."

JANE DECLINED IT, HOWEVER, AND THE HUSBAND AND WIFE WALKED OFF.
"HAPPY COUPLE!" SAID FRANK CHURCHILL, AS SOON AS THEY WERE OUT OF
HEARING:--"HOW WELL THEY SUIT ONE ANOTHER!--VERY LUCKY--MARRYING AS THEY
DID, UPON AN ACQUAINTANCE FORMED ONLY IN A PUBLIC PLACE!--THEY ONLY KNEW
EACH OTHER, I THINK, A FEW WEEKS IN BATH! PECULIARLY LUCKY!--FOR AS TO
ANY REAL KNOWLEDGE OF A PERSON'S DISPOSITION THAT BATH, OR ANY PUBLIC
PLACE, CAN GIVE--IT IS ALL NOTHING; THERE CAN BE NO KNOWLEDGE. IT IS
ONLY BY SEEING WOMEN IN THEIR OWN HOMES, AMONG THEIR OWN SET, JUST AS
THEY ALWAYS ARE, THAT YOU CAN FORM ANY JUST JUDGMENT. SHORT OF THAT, IT
IS ALL GUESS AND LUCK--AND WILL GENERALLY BE ILL-LUCK. HOW MANY A MAN
HAS COMMITTED HIMSELF ON A SHORT ACQUAINTANCE, AND RUED IT ALL THE REST
OF HIS LIFE!"

MISS FAIRFAX, WHO HAD SELDOM SPOKEN BEFORE, EXCEPT AMONG HER OWN
CONFEDERATES, SPOKE NOW.

"SUCH THINGS DO OCCUR, UNDOUBTEDLY."--SHE WAS STOPPED BY A COUGH. FRANK
CHURCHILL TURNED TOWARDS HER TO LISTEN.

"YOU WERE SPEAKING," SAID HE, GRAVELY. SHE RECOVERED HER VOICE.

"I WAS ONLY GOING TO OBSERVE, THAT THOUGH SUCH UNFORTUNATE CIRCUMSTANCES
DO SOMETIMES OCCUR BOTH TO MEN AND WOMEN, I CANNOT IMAGINE THEM TO BE
VERY FREQUENT. A HASTY AND IMPRUDENT ATTACHMENT MAY ARISE--BUT THERE IS
GENERALLY TIME TO RECOVER FROM IT AFTERWARDS. I WOULD BE UNDERSTOOD TO
MEAN, THAT IT CAN BE ONLY WEAK, IRRESOLUTE CHARACTERS, (WHOSE HAPPINESS
MUST BE ALWAYS AT THE MERCY OF CHANCE,) WHO WILL SUFFER AN UNFORTUNATE
ACQUAINTANCE TO BE AN INCONVENIENCE, AN OPPRESSION FOR EVER."

HE MADE NO ANSWER; MERELY LOOKED, AND BOWED IN SUBMISSION; AND SOON
AFTERWARDS SAID, IN A LIVELY TONE,

"WELL, I HAVE SO LITTLE CONFIDENCE IN MY OWN JUDGMENT, THAT WHENEVER I
MARRY, I HOPE SOME BODY WILL CHUSE MY WIFE FOR ME. WILL YOU? (TURNING TO
EMMA.) WILL YOU CHUSE A WIFE FOR ME?--I AM SURE I SHOULD LIKE ANY BODY
FIXED ON BY YOU. YOU PROVIDE FOR THE FAMILY, YOU KNOW, (WITH A SMILE AT
HIS FATHER). FIND SOME BODY FOR ME. I AM IN NO HURRY. ADOPT HER, EDUCATE
HER."

"AND MAKE HER LIKE MYSELF."

"BY ALL MEANS, IF YOU CAN."

"VERY WELL. I UNDERTAKE THE COMMISSION. YOU SHALL HAVE A CHARMING WIFE."

"SHE MUST BE VERY LIVELY, AND HAVE HAZLE EYES. I CARE FOR NOTHING ELSE.
I SHALL GO ABROAD FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS--AND WHEN I RETURN, I SHALL COME
TO YOU FOR MY WIFE. REMEMBER."

EMMA WAS IN NO DANGER OF FORGETTING. IT WAS A COMMISSION TO TOUCH EVERY
FAVOURITE FEELING. WOULD NOT HARRIET BE THE VERY CREATURE DESCRIBED?
HAZLE EYES EXCEPTED, TWO YEARS MORE MIGHT MAKE HER ALL THAT HE WISHED.
HE MIGHT EVEN HAVE HARRIET IN HIS THOUGHTS AT THE MOMENT; WHO COULD SAY?
REFERRING THE EDUCATION TO HER SEEMED TO IMPLY IT.

"NOW, MA'AM," SAID JANE TO HER AUNT, "SHALL WE JOIN MRS. ELTON?"

"IF YOU PLEASE, MY DEAR. WITH ALL MY HEART. I AM QUITE READY. I WAS
READY TO HAVE GONE WITH HER, BUT THIS WILL DO JUST AS WELL. WE SHALL
SOON OVERTAKE HER. THERE SHE IS--NO, THAT'S SOMEBODY ELSE. THAT'S ONE
OF THE LADIES IN THE IRISH CAR PARTY, NOT AT ALL LIKE HER.--WELL, I
DECLARE--"

THEY WALKED OFF, FOLLOWED IN HALF A MINUTE BY MR. KNIGHTLEY. MR. WESTON,
HIS SON, EMMA, AND HARRIET, ONLY REMAINED; AND THE YOUNG MAN'S SPIRITS
NOW ROSE TO A PITCH ALMOST UNPLEASANT. EVEN EMMA GREW TIRED AT LAST OF
FLATTERY AND MERRIMENT, AND WISHED HERSELF RATHER WALKING QUIETLY ABOUT
WITH ANY OF THE OTHERS, OR SITTING ALMOST ALONE, AND QUITE UNATTENDED
TO, IN TRANQUIL OBSERVATION OF THE BEAUTIFUL VIEWS BENEATH HER. THE
APPEARANCE OF THE SERVANTS LOOKING OUT FOR THEM TO GIVE NOTICE OF THE
CARRIAGES WAS A JOYFUL SIGHT; AND EVEN THE BUSTLE OF COLLECTING AND
PREPARING TO DEPART, AND THE SOLICITUDE OF MRS. ELTON TO HAVE HER
CARRIAGE FIRST, WERE GLADLY ENDURED, IN THE PROSPECT OF THE QUIET DRIVE
HOME WHICH WAS TO CLOSE THE VERY QUESTIONABLE ENJOYMENTS OF THIS DAY OF
PLEASURE. SUCH ANOTHER SCHEME, COMPOSED OF SO MANY ILL-ASSORTED PEOPLE,
SHE HOPED NEVER TO BE BETRAYED INTO AGAIN.

WHILE WAITING FOR THE CARRIAGE, SHE FOUND MR. KNIGHTLEY BY HER SIDE. HE
LOOKED AROUND, AS IF TO SEE THAT NO ONE WERE NEAR, AND THEN SAID,

"EMMA, I MUST ONCE MORE SPEAK TO YOU AS I HAVE BEEN USED TO DO: A
PRIVILEGE RATHER ENDURED THAN ALLOWED, PERHAPS, BUT I MUST STILL USE IT.
I CANNOT SEE YOU ACTING WRONG, WITHOUT A REMONSTRANCE. HOW COULD YOU BE
SO UNFEELING TO MISS BATES? HOW COULD YOU BE SO INSOLENT IN YOUR WIT TO
A WOMAN OF HER CHARACTER, AGE, AND SITUATION?--EMMA, I HAD NOT THOUGHT
IT POSSIBLE."

EMMA RECOLLECTED, BLUSHED, WAS SORRY, BUT TRIED TO LAUGH IT OFF.

"NAY, HOW COULD I HELP SAYING WHAT I DID?--NOBODY COULD HAVE HELPED IT.
IT WAS NOT SO VERY BAD. I DARE SAY SHE DID NOT UNDERSTAND ME."

"I ASSURE YOU SHE DID. SHE FELT YOUR FULL MEANING. SHE HAS TALKED OF
IT SINCE. I WISH YOU COULD HAVE HEARD HOW SHE TALKED OF IT--WITH WHAT
CANDOUR AND GENEROSITY. I WISH YOU COULD HAVE HEARD HER HONOURING YOUR
FORBEARANCE, IN BEING ABLE TO PAY HER SUCH ATTENTIONS, AS SHE WAS FOR
EVER RECEIVING FROM YOURSELF AND YOUR FATHER, WHEN HER SOCIETY MUST BE
SO IRKSOME."

"OH!" CRIED EMMA, "I KNOW THERE IS NOT A BETTER CREATURE IN THE WORLD:
BUT YOU MUST ALLOW, THAT WHAT IS GOOD AND WHAT IS RIDICULOUS ARE MOST
UNFORTUNATELY BLENDED IN HER."

"THEY ARE BLENDED," SAID HE, "I ACKNOWLEDGE; AND, WERE SHE PROSPEROUS,
I COULD ALLOW MUCH FOR THE OCCASIONAL PREVALENCE OF THE RIDICULOUS OVER
THE GOOD. WERE SHE A WOMAN OF FORTUNE, I WOULD LEAVE EVERY HARMLESS
ABSURDITY TO TAKE ITS CHANCE, I WOULD NOT QUARREL WITH YOU FOR ANY
LIBERTIES OF MANNER. WERE SHE YOUR EQUAL IN SITUATION--BUT, EMMA,
CONSIDER HOW FAR THIS IS FROM BEING THE CASE. SHE IS POOR; SHE HAS SUNK
FROM THE COMFORTS SHE WAS BORN TO; AND, IF SHE LIVE TO OLD AGE, MUST
PROBABLY SINK MORE. HER SITUATION SHOULD SECURE YOUR COMPASSION. IT WAS
BADLY DONE, INDEED! YOU, WHOM SHE HAD KNOWN FROM AN INFANT, WHOM SHE HAD
SEEN GROW UP FROM A PERIOD WHEN HER NOTICE WAS AN HONOUR, TO HAVE YOU
NOW, IN THOUGHTLESS SPIRITS, AND THE PRIDE OF THE MOMENT, LAUGH AT HER,
HUMBLE HER--AND BEFORE HER NIECE, TOO--AND BEFORE OTHERS, MANY OF WHOM
(CERTAINLY SOME,) WOULD BE ENTIRELY GUIDED BY YOUR TREATMENT
OF HER.--THIS IS NOT PLEASANT TO YOU, EMMA--AND IT IS VERY FAR FROM
PLEASANT TO ME; BUT I MUST, I WILL,--I WILL TELL YOU TRUTHS WHILE I CAN;
SATISFIED WITH PROVING MYSELF YOUR FRIEND BY VERY FAITHFUL COUNSEL, AND
TRUSTING THAT YOU WILL SOME TIME OR OTHER DO ME GREATER JUSTICE THAN YOU
CAN DO NOW."

WHILE THEY TALKED, THEY WERE ADVANCING TOWARDS THE CARRIAGE; IT WAS
READY; AND, BEFORE SHE COULD SPEAK AGAIN, HE HAD HANDED HER IN. HE HAD
MISINTERPRETED THE FEELINGS WHICH HAD KEPT HER FACE AVERTED, AND HER
TONGUE MOTIONLESS. THEY WERE COMBINED ONLY OF ANGER AGAINST HERSELF,
MORTIFICATION, AND DEEP CONCERN. SHE HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO SPEAK; AND, ON
ENTERING THE CARRIAGE, SUNK BACK FOR A MOMENT OVERCOME--THEN REPROACHING
HERSELF FOR HAVING TAKEN NO LEAVE, MAKING NO ACKNOWLEDGMENT, PARTING IN
APPARENT SULLENNESS, SHE LOOKED OUT WITH VOICE AND HAND EAGER TO SHEW A
DIFFERENCE; BUT IT WAS JUST TOO LATE. HE HAD TURNED AWAY, AND THE HORSES
WERE IN MOTION. SHE CONTINUED TO LOOK BACK, BUT IN VAIN; AND SOON, WITH
WHAT APPEARED UNUSUAL SPEED, THEY WERE HALF WAY DOWN THE HILL, AND
EVERY THING LEFT FAR BEHIND. SHE WAS VEXED BEYOND WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN
EXPRESSED--ALMOST BEYOND WHAT SHE COULD CONCEAL. NEVER HAD SHE FELT SO
AGITATED, MORTIFIED, GRIEVED, AT ANY CIRCUMSTANCE IN HER LIFE. SHE WAS
MOST FORCIBLY STRUCK. THE TRUTH OF THIS REPRESENTATION THERE WAS NO
DENYING. SHE FELT IT AT HER HEART. HOW COULD SHE HAVE BEEN SO BRUTAL,
SO CRUEL TO MISS BATES! HOW COULD SHE HAVE EXPOSED HERSELF TO SUCH ILL
OPINION IN ANY ONE SHE VALUED! AND HOW SUFFER HIM TO LEAVE HER WITHOUT
SAYING ONE WORD OF GRATITUDE, OF CONCURRENCE, OF COMMON KINDNESS!

TIME DID NOT COMPOSE HER. AS SHE REFLECTED MORE, SHE SEEMED BUT TO FEEL
IT MORE. SHE NEVER HAD BEEN SO DEPRESSED. HAPPILY IT WAS NOT NECESSARY
TO SPEAK. THERE WAS ONLY HARRIET, WHO SEEMED NOT IN SPIRITS HERSELF,
FAGGED, AND VERY WILLING TO BE SILENT; AND EMMA FELT THE TEARS RUNNING
DOWN HER CHEEKS ALMOST ALL THE WAY HOME, WITHOUT BEING AT ANY TROUBLE TO
CHECK THEM, EXTRAORDINARY AS THEY WERE.



CHAPTER VIII


THE WRETCHEDNESS OF A SCHEME TO BOX HILL WAS IN EMMA'S THOUGHTS ALL THE
EVENING. HOW IT MIGHT BE CONSIDERED BY THE REST OF THE PARTY, SHE COULD
NOT TELL. THEY, IN THEIR DIFFERENT HOMES, AND THEIR DIFFERENT WAYS,
MIGHT BE LOOKING BACK ON IT WITH PLEASURE; BUT IN HER VIEW IT WAS
A MORNING MORE COMPLETELY MISSPENT, MORE TOTALLY BARE OF RATIONAL
SATISFACTION AT THE TIME, AND MORE TO BE ABHORRED IN RECOLLECTION, THAN
ANY SHE HAD EVER PASSED. A WHOLE EVENING OF BACK-GAMMON WITH HER FATHER,
WAS FELICITY TO IT. THERE, INDEED, LAY REAL PLEASURE, FOR THERE SHE
WAS GIVING UP THE SWEETEST HOURS OF THE TWENTY-FOUR TO HIS COMFORT; AND
FEELING THAT, UNMERITED AS MIGHT BE THE DEGREE OF HIS FOND AFFECTION AND
CONFIDING ESTEEM, SHE COULD NOT, IN HER GENERAL CONDUCT, BE OPEN TO ANY
SEVERE REPROACH. AS A DAUGHTER, SHE HOPED SHE WAS NOT WITHOUT A HEART.
SHE HOPED NO ONE COULD HAVE SAID TO HER, "HOW COULD YOU BE SO UNFEELING
TO YOUR FATHER?--I MUST, I WILL TELL YOU TRUTHS WHILE I CAN." MISS
BATES SHOULD NEVER AGAIN--NO, NEVER! IF ATTENTION, IN FUTURE, COULD DO
AWAY THE PAST, SHE MIGHT HOPE TO BE FORGIVEN. SHE HAD BEEN OFTEN REMISS,
HER CONSCIENCE TOLD HER SO; REMISS, PERHAPS, MORE IN THOUGHT THAN FACT;
SCORNFUL, UNGRACIOUS. BUT IT SHOULD BE SO NO MORE. IN THE WARMTH OF TRUE
CONTRITION, SHE WOULD CALL UPON HER THE VERY NEXT MORNING, AND IT SHOULD
BE THE BEGINNING, ON HER SIDE, OF A REGULAR, EQUAL, KINDLY INTERCOURSE.

SHE WAS JUST AS DETERMINED WHEN THE MORROW CAME, AND WENT EARLY, THAT
NOTHING MIGHT PREVENT HER. IT WAS NOT UNLIKELY, SHE THOUGHT, THAT SHE
MIGHT SEE MR. KNIGHTLEY IN HER WAY; OR, PERHAPS, HE MIGHT COME IN
WHILE SHE WERE PAYING HER VISIT. SHE HAD NO OBJECTION. SHE WOULD NOT BE
ASHAMED OF THE APPEARANCE OF THE PENITENCE, SO JUSTLY AND TRULY HERS.
HER EYES WERE TOWARDS DONWELL AS SHE WALKED, BUT SHE SAW HIM NOT.

"THE LADIES WERE ALL AT HOME." SHE HAD NEVER REJOICED AT THE SOUND
BEFORE, NOR EVER BEFORE ENTERED THE PASSAGE, NOR WALKED UP THE STAIRS,
WITH ANY WISH OF GIVING PLEASURE, BUT IN CONFERRING OBLIGATION, OR OF
DERIVING IT, EXCEPT IN SUBSEQUENT RIDICULE.

THERE WAS A BUSTLE ON HER APPROACH; A GOOD DEAL OF MOVING AND TALKING.
SHE HEARD MISS BATES'S VOICE, SOMETHING WAS TO BE DONE IN A HURRY; THE
MAID LOOKED FRIGHTENED AND AWKWARD; HOPED SHE WOULD BE PLEASED TO WAIT A
MOMENT, AND THEN USHERED HER IN TOO SOON. THE AUNT AND NIECE SEEMED BOTH
ESCAPING INTO THE ADJOINING ROOM. JANE SHE HAD A DISTINCT GLIMPSE OF,
LOOKING EXTREMELY ILL; AND, BEFORE THE DOOR HAD SHUT THEM OUT, SHE HEARD
MISS BATES SAYING, "WELL, MY DEAR, I SHALL SAY YOU ARE LAID DOWN UPON
THE BED, AND I AM SURE YOU ARE ILL ENOUGH."

POOR OLD MRS. BATES, CIVIL AND HUMBLE AS USUAL, LOOKED AS IF SHE DID NOT
QUITE UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS GOING ON.

"I AM AFRAID JANE IS NOT VERY WELL," SAID SHE, "BUT I DO NOT KNOW; THEY
TELL ME SHE IS WELL. I DARE SAY MY DAUGHTER WILL BE HERE PRESENTLY,
MISS WOODHOUSE. I HOPE YOU FIND A CHAIR. I WISH HETTY HAD NOT GONE. I AM
VERY LITTLE ABLE--HAVE YOU A CHAIR, MA'AM? DO YOU SIT WHERE YOU LIKE? I
AM SURE SHE WILL BE HERE PRESENTLY."

EMMA SERIOUSLY HOPED SHE WOULD. SHE HAD A MOMENT'S FEAR OF MISS BATES
KEEPING AWAY FROM HER. BUT MISS BATES SOON CAME--"VERY HAPPY AND
OBLIGED"--BUT EMMA'S CONSCIENCE TOLD HER THAT THERE WAS NOT THE SAME
CHEERFUL VOLUBILITY AS BEFORE--LESS EASE OF LOOK AND MANNER. A VERY
FRIENDLY INQUIRY AFTER MISS FAIRFAX, SHE HOPED, MIGHT LEAD THE WAY TO A
RETURN OF OLD FEELINGS. THE TOUCH SEEMED IMMEDIATE.

"AH! MISS WOODHOUSE, HOW KIND YOU ARE!--I SUPPOSE YOU HAVE HEARD--AND
ARE COME TO GIVE US JOY. THIS DOES NOT SEEM MUCH LIKE JOY, INDEED, IN
ME--(TWINKLING AWAY A TEAR OR TWO)--BUT IT WILL BE VERY TRYING FOR US
TO PART WITH HER, AFTER HAVING HAD HER SO LONG, AND SHE HAS A DREADFUL
HEADACHE JUST NOW, WRITING ALL THE MORNING:--SUCH LONG LETTERS, YOU
KNOW, TO BE WRITTEN TO COLONEL CAMPBELL, AND MRS. DIXON. 'MY DEAR,' SAID
I, 'YOU WILL BLIND YOURSELF'--FOR TEARS WERE IN HER EYES PERPETUALLY.
ONE CANNOT WONDER, ONE CANNOT WONDER. IT IS A GREAT CHANGE; AND THOUGH
SHE IS AMAZINGLY FORTUNATE--SUCH A SITUATION, I SUPPOSE, AS NO
YOUNG WOMAN BEFORE EVER MET WITH ON FIRST GOING OUT--DO NOT THINK US
UNGRATEFUL, MISS WOODHOUSE, FOR SUCH SURPRISING GOOD FORTUNE--(AGAIN
DISPERSING HER TEARS)--BUT, POOR DEAR SOUL! IF YOU WERE TO SEE WHAT A
HEADACHE SHE HAS. WHEN ONE IS IN GREAT PAIN, YOU KNOW ONE CANNOT FEEL
ANY BLESSING QUITE AS IT MAY DESERVE. SHE IS AS LOW AS POSSIBLE. TO
LOOK AT HER, NOBODY WOULD THINK HOW DELIGHTED AND HAPPY SHE IS TO HAVE
SECURED SUCH A SITUATION. YOU WILL EXCUSE HER NOT COMING TO YOU--SHE IS
NOT ABLE--SHE IS GONE INTO HER OWN ROOM--I WANT HER TO LIE DOWN UPON THE
BED. 'MY DEAR,' SAID I, 'I SHALL SAY YOU ARE LAID DOWN UPON THE BED:'
BUT, HOWEVER, SHE IS NOT; SHE IS WALKING ABOUT THE ROOM. BUT, NOW THAT
SHE HAS WRITTEN HER LETTERS, SHE SAYS SHE SHALL SOON BE WELL. SHE WILL
BE EXTREMELY SORRY TO MISS SEEING YOU, MISS WOODHOUSE, BUT YOUR
KINDNESS WILL EXCUSE HER. YOU WERE KEPT WAITING AT THE DOOR--I WAS QUITE
ASHAMED--BUT SOMEHOW THERE WAS A LITTLE BUSTLE--FOR IT SO HAPPENED THAT
WE HAD NOT HEARD THE KNOCK, AND TILL YOU WERE ON THE STAIRS, WE DID NOT
KNOW ANY BODY WAS COMING. 'IT IS ONLY MRS. COLE,' SAID I, 'DEPEND UPON
IT. NOBODY ELSE WOULD COME SO EARLY.' 'WELL,' SAID SHE, 'IT MUST BE
BORNE SOME TIME OR OTHER, AND IT MAY AS WELL BE NOW.' BUT THEN PATTY
CAME IN, AND SAID IT WAS YOU. 'OH!' SAID I, 'IT IS MISS WOODHOUSE: I AM
SURE YOU WILL LIKE TO SEE HER.'--'I CAN SEE NOBODY,' SAID SHE; AND
UP SHE GOT, AND WOULD GO AWAY; AND THAT WAS WHAT MADE US KEEP YOU
WAITING--AND EXTREMELY SORRY AND ASHAMED WE WERE. 'IF YOU MUST GO, MY
DEAR,' SAID I, 'YOU MUST, AND I WILL SAY YOU ARE LAID DOWN UPON THE
BED.'"

EMMA WAS MOST SINCERELY INTERESTED. HER HEART HAD BEEN LONG GROWING
KINDER TOWARDS JANE; AND THIS PICTURE OF HER PRESENT SUFFERINGS ACTED
AS A CURE OF EVERY FORMER UNGENEROUS SUSPICION, AND LEFT HER NOTHING BUT
PITY; AND THE REMEMBRANCE OF THE LESS JUST AND LESS GENTLE SENSATIONS OF
THE PAST, OBLIGED HER TO ADMIT THAT JANE MIGHT VERY NATURALLY RESOLVE ON
SEEING MRS. COLE OR ANY OTHER STEADY FRIEND, WHEN SHE MIGHT NOT BEAR
TO SEE HERSELF. SHE SPOKE AS SHE FELT, WITH EARNEST REGRET AND
SOLICITUDE--SINCERELY WISHING THAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH SHE COLLECTED
FROM MISS BATES TO BE NOW ACTUALLY DETERMINED ON, MIGHT BE AS MUCH FOR
MISS FAIRFAX'S ADVANTAGE AND COMFORT AS POSSIBLE. "IT MUST BE A SEVERE
TRIAL TO THEM ALL. SHE HAD UNDERSTOOD IT WAS TO BE DELAYED TILL COLONEL
CAMPBELL'S RETURN."

"SO VERY KIND!" REPLIED MISS BATES. "BUT YOU ARE ALWAYS KIND."

THERE WAS NO BEARING SUCH AN "ALWAYS;" AND TO BREAK THROUGH HER DREADFUL
GRATITUDE, EMMA MADE THE DIRECT INQUIRY OF--

"WHERE--MAY I ASK?--IS MISS FAIRFAX GOING?"

"TO A MRS. SMALLRIDGE--CHARMING WOMAN--MOST SUPERIOR--TO HAVE THE CHARGE
OF HER THREE LITTLE GIRLS--DELIGHTFUL CHILDREN. IMPOSSIBLE THAT ANY
SITUATION COULD BE MORE REPLETE WITH COMFORT; IF WE EXCEPT, PERHAPS,
MRS. SUCKLING'S OWN FAMILY, AND MRS. BRAGGE'S; BUT MRS. SMALLRIDGE IS
INTIMATE WITH BOTH, AND IN THE VERY SAME NEIGHBOURHOOD:--LIVES ONLY FOUR
MILES FROM MAPLE GROVE. JANE WILL BE ONLY FOUR MILES FROM MAPLE GROVE."

"MRS. ELTON, I SUPPOSE, HAS BEEN THE PERSON TO WHOM MISS FAIRFAX OWES--"

"YES, OUR GOOD MRS. ELTON. THE MOST INDEFATIGABLE, TRUE FRIEND. SHE
WOULD NOT TAKE A DENIAL. SHE WOULD NOT LET JANE SAY, 'NO;' FOR WHEN JANE
FIRST HEARD OF IT, (IT WAS THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY, THE VERY MORNING
WE WERE AT DONWELL,) WHEN JANE FIRST HEARD OF IT, SHE WAS QUITE DECIDED
AGAINST ACCEPTING THE OFFER, AND FOR THE REASONS YOU MENTION; EXACTLY
AS YOU SAY, SHE HAD MADE UP HER MIND TO CLOSE WITH NOTHING TILL COLONEL
CAMPBELL'S RETURN, AND NOTHING SHOULD INDUCE HER TO ENTER INTO ANY
ENGAGEMENT AT PRESENT--AND SO SHE TOLD MRS. ELTON OVER AND OVER
AGAIN--AND I AM SURE I HAD NO MORE IDEA THAT SHE WOULD CHANGE HER
MIND!--BUT THAT GOOD MRS. ELTON, WHOSE JUDGMENT NEVER FAILS HER, SAW
FARTHER THAN I DID. IT IS NOT EVERY BODY THAT WOULD HAVE STOOD OUT IN
SUCH A KIND WAY AS SHE DID, AND REFUSE TO TAKE JANE'S ANSWER; BUT SHE
POSITIVELY DECLARED SHE WOULD NOT WRITE ANY SUCH DENIAL YESTERDAY, AS
JANE WISHED HER; SHE WOULD WAIT--AND, SURE ENOUGH, YESTERDAY EVENING IT
WAS ALL SETTLED THAT JANE SHOULD GO. QUITE A SURPRIZE TO ME! I HAD NOT
THE LEAST IDEA!--JANE TOOK MRS. ELTON ASIDE, AND TOLD HER AT ONCE, THAT
UPON THINKING OVER THE ADVANTAGES OF MRS. SMALLRIDGE'S SITUATION, SHE
HAD COME TO THE RESOLUTION OF ACCEPTING IT.--I DID NOT KNOW A WORD OF IT
TILL IT WAS ALL SETTLED."

"YOU SPENT THE EVENING WITH MRS. ELTON?"

"YES, ALL OF US; MRS. ELTON WOULD HAVE US COME. IT WAS SETTLED SO, UPON
THE HILL, WHILE WE WERE WALKING ABOUT WITH MR. KNIGHTLEY. 'YOU MUST
ALL SPEND YOUR EVENING WITH US,' SAID SHE--'I POSITIVELY MUST HAVE YOU
ALL COME.'"

"MR. KNIGHTLEY WAS THERE TOO, WAS HE?"

"NO, NOT MR. KNIGHTLEY; HE DECLINED IT FROM THE FIRST; AND THOUGH I
THOUGHT HE WOULD COME, BECAUSE MRS. ELTON DECLARED SHE WOULD NOT LET HIM
OFF, HE DID NOT;--BUT MY MOTHER, AND JANE, AND I, WERE ALL THERE, AND
A VERY AGREEABLE EVENING WE HAD. SUCH KIND FRIENDS, YOU KNOW, MISS
WOODHOUSE, ONE MUST ALWAYS FIND AGREEABLE, THOUGH EVERY BODY SEEMED
RATHER FAGGED AFTER THE MORNING'S PARTY. EVEN PLEASURE, YOU KNOW, IS
FATIGUING--AND I CANNOT SAY THAT ANY OF THEM SEEMED VERY MUCH TO HAVE
ENJOYED IT. HOWEVER, I SHALL ALWAYS THINK IT A VERY PLEASANT PARTY,
AND FEEL EXTREMELY OBLIGED TO THE KIND FRIENDS WHO INCLUDED ME IN IT."

"MISS FAIRFAX, I SUPPOSE, THOUGH YOU WERE NOT AWARE OF IT, HAD BEEN
MAKING UP HER MIND THE WHOLE DAY?"

"I DARE SAY SHE HAD."

"WHENEVER THE TIME MAY COME, IT MUST BE UNWELCOME TO HER AND ALL HER
FRIENDS--BUT I HOPE HER ENGAGEMENT WILL HAVE EVERY ALLEVIATION THAT IS
POSSIBLE--I MEAN, AS TO THE CHARACTER AND MANNERS OF THE FAMILY."

"THANK YOU, DEAR MISS WOODHOUSE. YES, INDEED, THERE IS EVERY THING
IN THE WORLD THAT CAN MAKE HER HAPPY IN IT. EXCEPT THE SUCKLINGS AND
BRAGGES, THERE IS NOT SUCH ANOTHER NURSERY ESTABLISHMENT, SO LIBERAL
AND ELEGANT, IN ALL MRS. ELTON'S ACQUAINTANCE. MRS. SMALLRIDGE, A MOST
DELIGHTFUL WOMAN!--A STYLE OF LIVING ALMOST EQUAL TO MAPLE GROVE--AND AS
TO THE CHILDREN, EXCEPT THE LITTLE SUCKLINGS AND LITTLE BRAGGES, THERE
ARE NOT SUCH ELEGANT SWEET CHILDREN ANYWHERE. JANE WILL BE TREATED WITH
SUCH REGARD AND KINDNESS!--IT WILL BE NOTHING BUT PLEASURE, A LIFE OF
PLEASURE.--AND HER SALARY!--I REALLY CANNOT VENTURE TO NAME HER SALARY
TO YOU, MISS WOODHOUSE. EVEN YOU, USED AS YOU ARE TO GREAT SUMS, WOULD
HARDLY BELIEVE THAT SO MUCH COULD BE GIVEN TO A YOUNG PERSON LIKE JANE."

"AH! MADAM," CRIED EMMA, "IF OTHER CHILDREN ARE AT ALL LIKE WHAT I
REMEMBER TO HAVE BEEN MYSELF, I SHOULD THINK FIVE TIMES THE AMOUNT OF
WHAT I HAVE EVER YET HEARD NAMED AS A SALARY ON SUCH OCCASIONS, DEARLY
EARNED."

"YOU ARE SO NOBLE IN YOUR IDEAS!"

"AND WHEN IS MISS FAIRFAX TO LEAVE YOU?"

"VERY SOON, VERY SOON, INDEED; THAT'S THE WORST OF IT. WITHIN A
FORTNIGHT. MRS. SMALLRIDGE IS IN A GREAT HURRY. MY POOR MOTHER DOES NOT
KNOW HOW TO BEAR IT. SO THEN, I TRY TO PUT IT OUT OF HER THOUGHTS, AND
SAY, COME MA'AM, DO NOT LET US THINK ABOUT IT ANY MORE."

"HER FRIENDS MUST ALL BE SORRY TO LOSE HER; AND WILL NOT COLONEL AND
MRS. CAMPBELL BE SORRY TO FIND THAT SHE HAS ENGAGED HERSELF BEFORE THEIR
RETURN?"

"YES; JANE SAYS SHE IS SURE THEY WILL; BUT YET, THIS IS SUCH A SITUATION
AS SHE CANNOT FEEL HERSELF JUSTIFIED IN DECLINING. I WAS SO ASTONISHED
WHEN SHE FIRST TOLD ME WHAT SHE HAD BEEN SAYING TO MRS. ELTON, AND WHEN
MRS. ELTON AT THE SAME MOMENT CAME CONGRATULATING ME UPON IT! IT WAS
BEFORE TEA--STAY--NO, IT COULD NOT BE BEFORE TEA, BECAUSE WE WERE
JUST GOING TO CARDS--AND YET IT WAS BEFORE TEA, BECAUSE I REMEMBER
THINKING--OH! NO, NOW I RECOLLECT, NOW I HAVE IT; SOMETHING HAPPENED
BEFORE TEA, BUT NOT THAT. MR. ELTON WAS CALLED OUT OF THE ROOM BEFORE
TEA, OLD JOHN ABDY'S SON WANTED TO SPEAK WITH HIM. POOR OLD JOHN, I
HAVE A GREAT REGARD FOR HIM; HE WAS CLERK TO MY POOR FATHER TWENTY-SEVEN
YEARS; AND NOW, POOR OLD MAN, HE IS BED-RIDDEN, AND VERY POORLY WITH THE
RHEUMATIC GOUT IN HIS JOINTS--I MUST GO AND SEE HIM TO-DAY; AND SO WILL
JANE, I AM SURE, IF SHE GETS OUT AT ALL. AND POOR JOHN'S SON CAME TO
TALK TO MR. ELTON ABOUT RELIEF FROM THE PARISH; HE IS VERY WELL TO DO
HIMSELF, YOU KNOW, BEING HEAD MAN AT THE CROWN, OSTLER, AND EVERY THING
OF THAT SORT, BUT STILL HE CANNOT KEEP HIS FATHER WITHOUT SOME HELP;
AND SO, WHEN MR. ELTON CAME BACK, HE TOLD US WHAT JOHN OSTLER HAD BEEN
TELLING HIM, AND THEN IT CAME OUT ABOUT THE CHAISE HAVING BEEN SENT TO
RANDALLS TO TAKE MR. FRANK CHURCHILL TO RICHMOND. THAT WAS WHAT HAPPENED
BEFORE TEA. IT WAS AFTER TEA THAT JANE SPOKE TO MRS. ELTON."

MISS BATES WOULD HARDLY GIVE EMMA TIME TO SAY HOW PERFECTLY NEW THIS
CIRCUMSTANCE WAS TO HER; BUT AS WITHOUT SUPPOSING IT POSSIBLE THAT SHE
COULD BE IGNORANT OF ANY OF THE PARTICULARS OF MR. FRANK CHURCHILL'S
GOING, SHE PROCEEDED TO GIVE THEM ALL, IT WAS OF NO CONSEQUENCE.

WHAT MR. ELTON HAD LEARNED FROM THE OSTLER ON THE SUBJECT, BEING THE
ACCUMULATION OF THE OSTLER'S OWN KNOWLEDGE, AND THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE
SERVANTS AT RANDALLS, WAS, THAT A MESSENGER HAD COME OVER FROM RICHMOND
SOON AFTER THE RETURN OF THE PARTY FROM BOX HILL--WHICH MESSENGER,
HOWEVER, HAD BEEN NO MORE THAN WAS EXPECTED; AND THAT MR. CHURCHILL HAD
SENT HIS NEPHEW A FEW LINES, CONTAINING, UPON THE WHOLE, A TOLERABLE
ACCOUNT OF MRS. CHURCHILL, AND ONLY WISHING HIM NOT TO DELAY COMING
BACK BEYOND THE NEXT MORNING EARLY; BUT THAT MR. FRANK CHURCHILL HAVING
RESOLVED TO GO HOME DIRECTLY, WITHOUT WAITING AT ALL, AND HIS HORSE
SEEMING TO HAVE GOT A COLD, TOM HAD BEEN SENT OFF IMMEDIATELY FOR THE
CROWN CHAISE, AND THE OSTLER HAD STOOD OUT AND SEEN IT PASS BY, THE BOY
GOING A GOOD PACE, AND DRIVING VERY STEADY.

THERE WAS NOTHING IN ALL THIS EITHER TO ASTONISH OR INTEREST, AND IT
CAUGHT EMMA'S ATTENTION ONLY AS IT UNITED WITH THE SUBJECT WHICH ALREADY
ENGAGED HER MIND. THE CONTRAST BETWEEN MRS. CHURCHILL'S IMPORTANCE IN
THE WORLD, AND JANE FAIRFAX'S, STRUCK HER; ONE WAS EVERY THING, THE
OTHER NOTHING--AND SHE SAT MUSING ON THE DIFFERENCE OF WOMAN'S DESTINY,
AND QUITE UNCONSCIOUS ON WHAT HER EYES WERE FIXED, TILL ROUSED BY MISS
BATES'S SAYING,

"AYE, I SEE WHAT YOU ARE THINKING OF, THE PIANOFORTE. WHAT IS TO BECOME
OF THAT?--VERY TRUE. POOR DEAR JANE WAS TALKING OF IT JUST NOW.--'YOU
MUST GO,' SAID SHE. 'YOU AND I MUST PART. YOU WILL HAVE NO BUSINESS
HERE.--LET IT STAY, HOWEVER,' SAID SHE; 'GIVE IT HOUSEROOM TILL COLONEL
CAMPBELL COMES BACK. I SHALL TALK ABOUT IT TO HIM; HE WILL SETTLE FOR
ME; HE WILL HELP ME OUT OF ALL MY DIFFICULTIES.'--AND TO THIS DAY, I DO
BELIEVE, SHE KNOWS NOT WHETHER IT WAS HIS PRESENT OR HIS DAUGHTER'S."

NOW EMMA WAS OBLIGED TO THINK OF THE PIANOFORTE; AND THE REMEMBRANCE OF
ALL HER FORMER FANCIFUL AND UNFAIR CONJECTURES WAS SO LITTLE PLEASING,
THAT SHE SOON ALLOWED HERSELF TO BELIEVE HER VISIT HAD BEEN LONG ENOUGH;
AND, WITH A REPETITION OF EVERY THING THAT SHE COULD VENTURE TO SAY OF
THE GOOD WISHES WHICH SHE REALLY FELT, TOOK LEAVE.



CHAPTER IX


EMMA'S PENSIVE MEDITATIONS, AS SHE WALKED HOME, WERE NOT INTERRUPTED;
BUT ON ENTERING THE PARLOUR, SHE FOUND THOSE WHO MUST ROUSE HER. MR.
KNIGHTLEY AND HARRIET HAD ARRIVED DURING HER ABSENCE, AND WERE SITTING
WITH HER FATHER.--MR. KNIGHTLEY IMMEDIATELY GOT UP, AND IN A MANNER
DECIDEDLY GRAVER THAN USUAL, SAID,

"I WOULD NOT GO AWAY WITHOUT SEEING YOU, BUT I HAVE NO TIME TO SPARE,
AND THEREFORE MUST NOW BE GONE DIRECTLY. I AM GOING TO LONDON, TO SPEND
A FEW DAYS WITH JOHN AND ISABELLA. HAVE YOU ANY THING TO SEND OR SAY,
BESIDES THE 'LOVE,' WHICH NOBODY CARRIES?"

"NOTHING AT ALL. BUT IS NOT THIS A SUDDEN SCHEME?"

"YES--RATHER--I HAVE BEEN THINKING OF IT SOME LITTLE TIME."

EMMA WAS SURE HE HAD NOT FORGIVEN HER; HE LOOKED UNLIKE HIMSELF. TIME,
HOWEVER, SHE THOUGHT, WOULD TELL HIM THAT THEY OUGHT TO BE FRIENDS
AGAIN. WHILE HE STOOD, AS IF MEANING TO GO, BUT NOT GOING--HER FATHER
BEGAN HIS INQUIRIES.

"WELL, MY DEAR, AND DID YOU GET THERE SAFELY?--AND HOW DID YOU FIND MY
WORTHY OLD FRIEND AND HER DAUGHTER?--I DARE SAY THEY MUST HAVE BEEN VERY
MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU FOR COMING. DEAR EMMA HAS BEEN TO CALL ON MRS.
AND MISS BATES, MR. KNIGHTLEY, AS I TOLD YOU BEFORE. SHE IS ALWAYS SO
ATTENTIVE TO THEM!"

EMMA'S COLOUR WAS HEIGHTENED BY THIS UNJUST PRAISE; AND WITH A
SMILE, AND SHAKE OF THE HEAD, WHICH SPOKE MUCH, SHE LOOKED AT MR.
KNIGHTLEY.--IT SEEMED AS IF THERE WERE AN INSTANTANEOUS IMPRESSION IN
HER FAVOUR, AS IF HIS EYES RECEIVED THE TRUTH FROM HER'S, AND ALL THAT
HAD PASSED OF GOOD IN HER FEELINGS WERE AT ONCE CAUGHT AND HONOURED.--
HE LOOKED AT HER WITH A GLOW OF REGARD. SHE WAS WARMLY GRATIFIED--AND IN
ANOTHER MOMENT STILL MORE SO, BY A LITTLE MOVEMENT OF MORE THAN COMMON
FRIENDLINESS ON HIS PART.--HE TOOK HER HAND;--WHETHER SHE HAD NOT
HERSELF MADE THE FIRST MOTION, SHE COULD NOT SAY--SHE MIGHT, PERHAPS,
HAVE RATHER OFFERED IT--BUT HE TOOK HER HAND, PRESSED IT, AND CERTAINLY
WAS ON THE POINT OF CARRYING IT TO HIS LIPS--WHEN, FROM SOME FANCY OR
OTHER, HE SUDDENLY LET IT GO.--WHY HE SHOULD FEEL SUCH A SCRUPLE, WHY
HE SHOULD CHANGE HIS MIND WHEN IT WAS ALL BUT DONE, SHE COULD NOT
PERCEIVE.--HE WOULD HAVE JUDGED BETTER, SHE THOUGHT, IF HE HAD NOT
STOPPED.--THE INTENTION, HOWEVER, WAS INDUBITABLE; AND WHETHER IT WAS
THAT HIS MANNERS HAD IN GENERAL SO LITTLE GALLANTRY, OR HOWEVER ELSE IT
HAPPENED, BUT SHE THOUGHT NOTHING BECAME HIM MORE.--IT WAS WITH HIM,
OF SO SIMPLE, YET SO DIGNIFIED A NATURE.--SHE COULD NOT BUT RECALL THE
ATTEMPT WITH GREAT SATISFACTION. IT SPOKE SUCH PERFECT AMITY.--HE LEFT
THEM IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS--GONE IN A MOMENT. HE ALWAYS MOVED WITH THE
ALERTNESS OF A MIND WHICH COULD NEITHER BE UNDECIDED NOR DILATORY, BUT
NOW HE SEEMED MORE SUDDEN THAN USUAL IN HIS DISAPPEARANCE.

EMMA COULD NOT REGRET HER HAVING GONE TO MISS BATES, BUT SHE WISHED SHE
HAD LEFT HER TEN MINUTES EARLIER;--IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A GREAT PLEASURE
TO TALK OVER JANE FAIRFAX'S SITUATION WITH MR. KNIGHTLEY.--NEITHER
WOULD SHE REGRET THAT HE SHOULD BE GOING TO BRUNSWICK SQUARE, FOR SHE
KNEW HOW MUCH HIS VISIT WOULD BE ENJOYED--BUT IT MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED
AT A BETTER TIME--AND TO HAVE HAD LONGER NOTICE OF IT, WOULD HAVE BEEN
PLEASANTER.--THEY PARTED THOROUGH FRIENDS, HOWEVER; SHE COULD NOT
BE DECEIVED AS TO THE MEANING OF HIS COUNTENANCE, AND HIS UNFINISHED
GALLANTRY;--IT WAS ALL DONE TO ASSURE HER THAT SHE HAD FULLY RECOVERED
HIS GOOD OPINION.--HE HAD BEEN SITTING WITH THEM HALF AN HOUR, SHE
FOUND. IT WAS A PITY THAT SHE HAD NOT COME BACK EARLIER!

IN THE HOPE OF DIVERTING HER FATHER'S THOUGHTS FROM THE DISAGREEABLENESS
OF MR. KNIGHTLEY'S GOING TO LONDON; AND GOING SO SUDDENLY; AND GOING ON
HORSEBACK, WHICH SHE KNEW WOULD BE ALL VERY BAD; EMMA COMMUNICATED HER
NEWS OF JANE FAIRFAX, AND HER DEPENDENCE ON THE EFFECT WAS JUSTIFIED;
IT SUPPLIED A VERY USEFUL CHECK,--INTERESTED, WITHOUT DISTURBING HIM. HE
HAD LONG MADE UP HIS MIND TO JANE FAIRFAX'S GOING OUT AS GOVERNESS, AND
COULD TALK OF IT CHEERFULLY, BUT MR. KNIGHTLEY'S GOING TO LONDON HAD
BEEN AN UNEXPECTED BLOW.

"I AM VERY GLAD, INDEED, MY DEAR, TO HEAR SHE IS TO BE SO COMFORTABLY
SETTLED. MRS. ELTON IS VERY GOOD-NATURED AND AGREEABLE, AND I DARE SAY
HER ACQUAINTANCE ARE JUST WHAT THEY OUGHT TO BE. I HOPE IT IS A DRY
SITUATION, AND THAT HER HEALTH WILL BE TAKEN GOOD CARE OF. IT OUGHT TO
BE A FIRST OBJECT, AS I AM SURE POOR MISS TAYLOR'S ALWAYS WAS WITH ME.
YOU KNOW, MY DEAR, SHE IS GOING TO BE TO THIS NEW LADY WHAT MISS TAYLOR
WAS TO US. AND I HOPE SHE WILL BE BETTER OFF IN ONE RESPECT, AND NOT BE
INDUCED TO GO AWAY AFTER IT HAS BEEN HER HOME SO LONG."

THE FOLLOWING DAY BROUGHT NEWS FROM RICHMOND TO THROW EVERY THING ELSE
INTO THE BACKGROUND. AN EXPRESS ARRIVED AT RANDALLS TO ANNOUNCE THE
DEATH OF MRS. CHURCHILL! THOUGH HER NEPHEW HAD HAD NO PARTICULAR REASON
TO HASTEN BACK ON HER ACCOUNT, SHE HAD NOT LIVED ABOVE SIX-AND-THIRTY
HOURS AFTER HIS RETURN. A SUDDEN SEIZURE OF A DIFFERENT NATURE FROM ANY
THING FOREBODED BY HER GENERAL STATE, HAD CARRIED HER OFF AFTER A SHORT
STRUGGLE. THE GREAT MRS. CHURCHILL WAS NO MORE.

IT WAS FELT AS SUCH THINGS MUST BE FELT. EVERY BODY HAD A DEGREE OF
GRAVITY AND SORROW; TENDERNESS TOWARDS THE DEPARTED, SOLICITUDE FOR THE
SURVIVING FRIENDS; AND, IN A REASONABLE TIME, CURIOSITY TO KNOW WHERE
SHE WOULD BE BURIED. GOLDSMITH TELLS US, THAT WHEN LOVELY WOMAN STOOPS
TO FOLLY, SHE HAS NOTHING TO DO BUT TO DIE; AND WHEN SHE STOOPS TO BE
DISAGREEABLE, IT IS EQUALLY TO BE RECOMMENDED AS A CLEARER OF ILL-FAME.
MRS. CHURCHILL, AFTER BEING DISLIKED AT LEAST TWENTY-FIVE YEARS, WAS
NOW SPOKEN OF WITH COMPASSIONATE ALLOWANCES. IN ONE POINT SHE WAS FULLY
JUSTIFIED. SHE HAD NEVER BEEN ADMITTED BEFORE TO BE SERIOUSLY ILL. THE
EVENT ACQUITTED HER OF ALL THE FANCIFULNESS, AND ALL THE SELFISHNESS OF
IMAGINARY COMPLAINTS.

"POOR MRS. CHURCHILL! NO DOUBT SHE HAD BEEN SUFFERING A GREAT DEAL:
MORE THAN ANY BODY HAD EVER SUPPOSED--AND CONTINUAL PAIN WOULD TRY THE
TEMPER. IT WAS A SAD EVENT--A GREAT SHOCK--WITH ALL HER FAULTS, WHAT
WOULD MR. CHURCHILL DO WITHOUT HER? MR. CHURCHILL'S LOSS WOULD BE
DREADFUL INDEED. MR. CHURCHILL WOULD NEVER GET OVER IT."--EVEN MR.
WESTON SHOOK HIS HEAD, AND LOOKED SOLEMN, AND SAID, "AH! POOR WOMAN,
WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT!" AND RESOLVED, THAT HIS MOURNING SHOULD BE AS
HANDSOME AS POSSIBLE; AND HIS WIFE SAT SIGHING AND MORALISING OVER HER
BROAD HEMS WITH A COMMISERATION AND GOOD SENSE, TRUE AND STEADY. HOW IT
WOULD AFFECT FRANK WAS AMONG THE EARLIEST THOUGHTS OF BOTH. IT WAS ALSO
A VERY EARLY SPECULATION WITH EMMA. THE CHARACTER OF MRS. CHURCHILL,
THE GRIEF OF HER HUSBAND--HER MIND GLANCED OVER THEM BOTH WITH AWE AND
COMPASSION--AND THEN RESTED WITH LIGHTENED FEELINGS ON HOW FRANK MIGHT
BE AFFECTED BY THE EVENT, HOW BENEFITED, HOW FREED. SHE SAW IN A MOMENT
ALL THE POSSIBLE GOOD. NOW, AN ATTACHMENT TO HARRIET SMITH WOULD HAVE
NOTHING TO ENCOUNTER. MR. CHURCHILL, INDEPENDENT OF HIS WIFE, WAS FEARED
BY NOBODY; AN EASY, GUIDABLE MAN, TO BE PERSUADED INTO ANY THING BY HIS
NEPHEW. ALL THAT REMAINED TO BE WISHED WAS, THAT THE NEPHEW SHOULD FORM
THE ATTACHMENT, AS, WITH ALL HER GOODWILL IN THE CAUSE, EMMA COULD FEEL
NO CERTAINTY OF ITS BEING ALREADY FORMED.

HARRIET BEHAVED EXTREMELY WELL ON THE OCCASION, WITH GREAT SELF-COMMAND.
WHAT EVER SHE MIGHT FEEL OF BRIGHTER HOPE, SHE BETRAYED NOTHING. EMMA
WAS GRATIFIED, TO OBSERVE SUCH A PROOF IN HER OF STRENGTHENED CHARACTER,
AND REFRAINED FROM ANY ALLUSION THAT MIGHT ENDANGER ITS MAINTENANCE.
THEY SPOKE, THEREFORE, OF MRS. CHURCHILL'S DEATH WITH MUTUAL
FORBEARANCE.

SHORT LETTERS FROM FRANK WERE RECEIVED AT RANDALLS, COMMUNICATING ALL
THAT WAS IMMEDIATELY IMPORTANT OF THEIR STATE AND PLANS. MR. CHURCHILL
WAS BETTER THAN COULD BE EXPECTED; AND THEIR FIRST REMOVAL, ON THE
DEPARTURE OF THE FUNERAL FOR YORKSHIRE, WAS TO BE TO THE HOUSE OF A VERY
OLD FRIEND IN WINDSOR, TO WHOM MR. CHURCHILL HAD BEEN PROMISING A
VISIT THE LAST TEN YEARS. AT PRESENT, THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE DONE FOR
HARRIET; GOOD WISHES FOR THE FUTURE WERE ALL THAT COULD YET BE POSSIBLE
ON EMMA'S SIDE.

IT WAS A MORE PRESSING CONCERN TO SHEW ATTENTION TO JANE FAIRFAX, WHOSE
PROSPECTS WERE CLOSING, WHILE HARRIET'S OPENED, AND WHOSE ENGAGEMENTS
NOW ALLOWED OF NO DELAY IN ANY ONE AT HIGHBURY, WHO WISHED TO SHEW HER
KINDNESS--AND WITH EMMA IT WAS GROWN INTO A FIRST WISH. SHE HAD SCARCELY
A STRONGER REGRET THAN FOR HER PAST COLDNESS; AND THE PERSON, WHOM SHE
HAD BEEN SO MANY MONTHS NEGLECTING, WAS NOW THE VERY ONE ON WHOM SHE
WOULD HAVE LAVISHED EVERY DISTINCTION OF REGARD OR SYMPATHY. SHE WANTED
TO BE OF USE TO HER; WANTED TO SHEW A VALUE FOR HER SOCIETY, AND TESTIFY
RESPECT AND CONSIDERATION. SHE RESOLVED TO PREVAIL ON HER TO SPEND A DAY
AT HARTFIELD. A NOTE WAS WRITTEN TO URGE IT. THE INVITATION WAS REFUSED,
AND BY A VERBAL MESSAGE. "MISS FAIRFAX WAS NOT WELL ENOUGH TO WRITE;"
AND WHEN MR. PERRY CALLED AT HARTFIELD, THE SAME MORNING, IT APPEARED
THAT SHE WAS SO MUCH INDISPOSED AS TO HAVE BEEN VISITED, THOUGH AGAINST
HER OWN CONSENT, BY HIMSELF, AND THAT SHE WAS SUFFERING UNDER SEVERE
HEADACHES, AND A NERVOUS FEVER TO A DEGREE, WHICH MADE HIM DOUBT THE
POSSIBILITY OF HER GOING TO MRS. SMALLRIDGE'S AT THE TIME PROPOSED.
HER HEALTH SEEMED FOR THE MOMENT COMPLETELY DERANGED--APPETITE QUITE
GONE--AND THOUGH THERE WERE NO ABSOLUTELY ALARMING SYMPTOMS, NOTHING
TOUCHING THE PULMONARY COMPLAINT, WHICH WAS THE STANDING APPREHENSION
OF THE FAMILY, MR. PERRY WAS UNEASY ABOUT HER. HE THOUGHT SHE HAD
UNDERTAKEN MORE THAN SHE WAS EQUAL TO, AND THAT SHE FELT IT SO HERSELF,
THOUGH SHE WOULD NOT OWN IT. HER SPIRITS SEEMED OVERCOME. HER
PRESENT HOME, HE COULD NOT BUT OBSERVE, WAS UNFAVOURABLE TO A NERVOUS
DISORDER:--CONFINED ALWAYS TO ONE ROOM;--HE COULD HAVE WISHED IT
OTHERWISE--AND HER GOOD AUNT, THOUGH HIS VERY OLD FRIEND, HE MUST
ACKNOWLEDGE TO BE NOT THE BEST COMPANION FOR AN INVALID OF THAT
DESCRIPTION. HER CARE AND ATTENTION COULD NOT BE QUESTIONED; THEY WERE,
IN FACT, ONLY TOO GREAT. HE VERY MUCH FEARED THAT MISS FAIRFAX DERIVED
MORE EVIL THAN GOOD FROM THEM. EMMA LISTENED WITH THE WARMEST CONCERN;
GRIEVED FOR HER MORE AND MORE, AND LOOKED AROUND EAGER TO DISCOVER SOME
WAY OF BEING USEFUL. TO TAKE HER--BE IT ONLY AN HOUR OR TWO--FROM
HER AUNT, TO GIVE HER CHANGE OF AIR AND SCENE, AND QUIET RATIONAL
CONVERSATION, EVEN FOR AN HOUR OR TWO, MIGHT DO HER GOOD; AND THE
FOLLOWING MORNING SHE WROTE AGAIN TO SAY, IN THE MOST FEELING LANGUAGE
SHE COULD COMMAND, THAT SHE WOULD CALL FOR HER IN THE CARRIAGE AT ANY
HOUR THAT JANE WOULD NAME--MENTIONING THAT SHE HAD MR. PERRY'S DECIDED
OPINION, IN FAVOUR OF SUCH EXERCISE FOR HIS PATIENT. THE ANSWER WAS ONLY
IN THIS SHORT NOTE:

"MISS FAIRFAX'S COMPLIMENTS AND THANKS, BUT IS QUITE UNEQUAL TO ANY
EXERCISE."

EMMA FELT THAT HER OWN NOTE HAD DESERVED SOMETHING BETTER; BUT IT WAS
IMPOSSIBLE TO QUARREL WITH WORDS, WHOSE TREMULOUS INEQUALITY SHEWED
INDISPOSITION SO PLAINLY, AND SHE THOUGHT ONLY OF HOW SHE MIGHT BEST
COUNTERACT THIS UNWILLINGNESS TO BE SEEN OR ASSISTED. IN SPITE OF THE
ANSWER, THEREFORE, SHE ORDERED THE CARRIAGE, AND DROVE TO MRS. BATES'S,
IN THE HOPE THAT JANE WOULD BE INDUCED TO JOIN HER--BUT IT WOULD NOT
DO;--MISS BATES CAME TO THE CARRIAGE DOOR, ALL GRATITUDE, AND AGREEING
WITH HER MOST EARNESTLY IN THINKING AN AIRING MIGHT BE OF THE GREATEST
SERVICE--AND EVERY THING THAT MESSAGE COULD DO WAS TRIED--BUT ALL IN
VAIN. MISS BATES WAS OBLIGED TO RETURN WITHOUT SUCCESS; JANE WAS
QUITE UNPERSUADABLE; THE MERE PROPOSAL OF GOING OUT SEEMED TO MAKE HER
WORSE.--EMMA WISHED SHE COULD HAVE SEEN HER, AND TRIED HER OWN POWERS;
BUT, ALMOST BEFORE SHE COULD HINT THE WISH, MISS BATES MADE IT APPEAR
THAT SHE HAD PROMISED HER NIECE ON NO ACCOUNT TO LET MISS WOODHOUSE IN.
"INDEED, THE TRUTH WAS, THAT POOR DEAR JANE COULD NOT BEAR TO SEE ANY
BODY--ANY BODY AT ALL--MRS. ELTON, INDEED, COULD NOT BE DENIED--AND
MRS. COLE HAD MADE SUCH A POINT--AND MRS. PERRY HAD SAID SO MUCH--BUT,
EXCEPT THEM, JANE WOULD REALLY SEE NOBODY."

EMMA DID NOT WANT TO BE CLASSED WITH THE MRS. ELTONS, THE MRS. PERRYS,
AND THE MRS. COLES, WHO WOULD FORCE THEMSELVES ANYWHERE; NEITHER COULD
SHE FEEL ANY RIGHT OF PREFERENCE HERSELF--SHE SUBMITTED, THEREFORE, AND
ONLY QUESTIONED MISS BATES FARTHER AS TO HER NIECE'S APPETITE AND DIET,
WHICH SHE LONGED TO BE ABLE TO ASSIST. ON THAT SUBJECT POOR MISS BATES
WAS VERY UNHAPPY, AND VERY COMMUNICATIVE; JANE WOULD HARDLY EAT ANY
THING:--MR. PERRY RECOMMENDED NOURISHING FOOD; BUT EVERY THING
THEY COULD COMMAND (AND NEVER HAD ANY BODY SUCH GOOD NEIGHBOURS) WAS
DISTASTEFUL.

EMMA, ON REACHING HOME, CALLED THE HOUSEKEEPER DIRECTLY, TO AN
EXAMINATION OF HER STORES; AND SOME ARROWROOT OF VERY SUPERIOR QUALITY
WAS SPEEDILY DESPATCHED TO MISS BATES WITH A MOST FRIENDLY NOTE. IN HALF
AN HOUR THE ARROWROOT WAS RETURNED, WITH A THOUSAND THANKS FROM MISS
BATES, BUT "DEAR JANE WOULD NOT BE SATISFIED WITHOUT ITS BEING SENT
BACK; IT WAS A THING SHE COULD NOT TAKE--AND, MOREOVER, SHE INSISTED ON
HER SAYING, THAT SHE WAS NOT AT ALL IN WANT OF ANY THING."

WHEN EMMA AFTERWARDS HEARD THAT JANE FAIRFAX HAD BEEN SEEN WANDERING
ABOUT THE MEADOWS, AT SOME DISTANCE FROM HIGHBURY, ON THE AFTERNOON OF
THE VERY DAY ON WHICH SHE HAD, UNDER THE PLEA OF BEING UNEQUAL TO ANY
EXERCISE, SO PEREMPTORILY REFUSED TO GO OUT WITH HER IN THE CARRIAGE,
SHE COULD HAVE NO DOUBT--PUTTING EVERY THING TOGETHER--THAT JANE WAS
RESOLVED TO RECEIVE NO KINDNESS FROM HER. SHE WAS SORRY, VERY SORRY.
HER HEART WAS GRIEVED FOR A STATE WHICH SEEMED BUT THE MORE PITIABLE
FROM THIS SORT OF IRRITATION OF SPIRITS, INCONSISTENCY OF ACTION, AND
INEQUALITY OF POWERS; AND IT MORTIFIED HER THAT SHE WAS GIVEN SO LITTLE
CREDIT FOR PROPER FEELING, OR ESTEEMED SO LITTLE WORTHY AS A FRIEND: BUT
SHE HAD THE CONSOLATION OF KNOWING THAT HER INTENTIONS WERE GOOD, AND OF
BEING ABLE TO SAY TO HERSELF, THAT COULD MR. KNIGHTLEY HAVE BEEN PRIVY
TO ALL HER ATTEMPTS OF ASSISTING JANE FAIRFAX, COULD HE EVEN HAVE SEEN
INTO HER HEART, HE WOULD NOT, ON THIS OCCASION, HAVE FOUND ANY THING TO
REPROVE.



CHAPTER X


ONE MORNING, ABOUT TEN DAYS AFTER MRS. CHURCHILL'S DECEASE, EMMA WAS
CALLED DOWNSTAIRS TO MR. WESTON, WHO "COULD NOT STAY FIVE MINUTES,
AND WANTED PARTICULARLY TO SPEAK WITH HER."--HE MET HER AT THE
PARLOUR-DOOR, AND HARDLY ASKING HER HOW SHE DID, IN THE NATURAL KEY OF
HIS VOICE, SUNK IT IMMEDIATELY, TO SAY, UNHEARD BY HER FATHER,

"CAN YOU COME TO RANDALLS AT ANY TIME THIS MORNING?--DO, IF IT BE
POSSIBLE. MRS. WESTON WANTS TO SEE YOU. SHE MUST SEE YOU."

"IS SHE UNWELL?"

"NO, NO, NOT AT ALL--ONLY A LITTLE AGITATED. SHE WOULD HAVE ORDERED THE
CARRIAGE, AND COME TO YOU, BUT SHE MUST SEE YOU ALONE, AND THAT YOU
KNOW--(NODDING TOWARDS HER FATHER)--HUMPH!--CAN YOU COME?"

"CERTAINLY. THIS MOMENT, IF YOU PLEASE. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO REFUSE WHAT
YOU ASK IN SUCH A WAY. BUT WHAT CAN BE THE MATTER?--IS SHE REALLY NOT
ILL?"

"DEPEND UPON ME--BUT ASK NO MORE QUESTIONS. YOU WILL KNOW IT ALL IN
TIME. THE MOST UNACCOUNTABLE BUSINESS! BUT HUSH, HUSH!"

TO GUESS WHAT ALL THIS MEANT, WAS IMPOSSIBLE EVEN FOR EMMA. SOMETHING
REALLY IMPORTANT SEEMED ANNOUNCED BY HIS LOOKS; BUT, AS HER FRIEND WAS
WELL, SHE ENDEAVOURED NOT TO BE UNEASY, AND SETTLING IT WITH HER FATHER,
THAT SHE WOULD TAKE HER WALK NOW, SHE AND MR. WESTON WERE SOON OUT OF
THE HOUSE TOGETHER AND ON THEIR WAY AT A QUICK PACE FOR RANDALLS.

"NOW,"--SAID EMMA, WHEN THEY WERE FAIRLY BEYOND THE SWEEP GATES,--"NOW
MR. WESTON, DO LET ME KNOW WHAT HAS HAPPENED."

"NO, NO,"--HE GRAVELY REPLIED.--"DON'T ASK ME. I PROMISED MY WIFE TO
LEAVE IT ALL TO HER. SHE WILL BREAK IT TO YOU BETTER THAN I CAN. DO NOT
BE IMPATIENT, EMMA; IT WILL ALL COME OUT TOO SOON."

"BREAK IT TO ME," CRIED EMMA, STANDING STILL WITH TERROR.--"GOOD
GOD!--MR. WESTON, TELL ME AT ONCE.--SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED IN BRUNSWICK
SQUARE. I KNOW IT HAS. TELL ME, I CHARGE YOU TELL ME THIS MOMENT WHAT IT
IS."

"NO, INDEED YOU ARE MISTAKEN."--

"MR. WESTON DO NOT TRIFLE WITH ME.--CONSIDER HOW MANY OF MY DEAREST
FRIENDS ARE NOW IN BRUNSWICK SQUARE. WHICH OF THEM IS IT?--I CHARGE YOU
BY ALL THAT IS SACRED, NOT TO ATTEMPT CONCEALMENT."

"UPON MY WORD, EMMA."--

"YOUR WORD!--WHY NOT YOUR HONOUR!--WHY NOT SAY UPON YOUR HONOUR, THAT
IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ANY OF THEM? GOOD HEAVENS!--WHAT CAN BE TO BE
BROKE TO ME, THAT DOES NOT RELATE TO ONE OF THAT FAMILY?"

"UPON MY HONOUR," SAID HE VERY SERIOUSLY, "IT DOES NOT. IT IS NOT IN
THE SMALLEST DEGREE CONNECTED WITH ANY HUMAN BEING OF THE NAME OF
KNIGHTLEY."

EMMA'S COURAGE RETURNED, AND SHE WALKED ON.

"I WAS WRONG," HE CONTINUED, "IN TALKING OF ITS BEING BROKE TO YOU.
I SHOULD NOT HAVE USED THE EXPRESSION. IN FACT, IT DOES NOT CONCERN
YOU--IT CONCERNS ONLY MYSELF,--THAT IS, WE HOPE.--HUMPH!--IN SHORT, MY
DEAR EMMA, THERE IS NO OCCASION TO BE SO UNEASY ABOUT IT. I DON'T
SAY THAT IT IS NOT A DISAGREEABLE BUSINESS--BUT THINGS MIGHT BE MUCH
WORSE.--IF WE WALK FAST, WE SHALL SOON BE AT RANDALLS."

EMMA FOUND THAT SHE MUST WAIT; AND NOW IT REQUIRED LITTLE EFFORT. SHE
ASKED NO MORE QUESTIONS THEREFORE, MERELY EMPLOYED HER OWN FANCY, AND
THAT SOON POINTED OUT TO HER THE PROBABILITY OF ITS BEING SOME MONEY
CONCERN--SOMETHING JUST COME TO LIGHT, OF A DISAGREEABLE NATURE IN THE
CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE FAMILY,--SOMETHING WHICH THE LATE EVENT AT RICHMOND
HAD BROUGHT FORWARD. HER FANCY WAS VERY ACTIVE. HALF A DOZEN NATURAL
CHILDREN, PERHAPS--AND POOR FRANK CUT OFF!--THIS, THOUGH VERY
UNDESIRABLE, WOULD BE NO MATTER OF AGONY TO HER. IT INSPIRED LITTLE MORE
THAN AN ANIMATING CURIOSITY.

"WHO IS THAT GENTLEMAN ON HORSEBACK?" SAID SHE, AS THEY
PROCEEDED--SPEAKING MORE TO ASSIST MR. WESTON IN KEEPING HIS SECRET,
THAN WITH ANY OTHER VIEW.

"I DO NOT KNOW.--ONE OF THE OTWAYS.--NOT FRANK;--IT IS NOT FRANK, I
ASSURE YOU. YOU WILL NOT SEE HIM. HE IS HALF WAY TO WINDSOR BY THIS
TIME."

"HAS YOUR SON BEEN WITH YOU, THEN?"

"OH! YES--DID NOT YOU KNOW?--WELL, WELL, NEVER MIND."

FOR A MOMENT HE WAS SILENT; AND THEN ADDED, IN A TONE MUCH MORE GUARDED
AND DEMURE,

"YES, FRANK CAME OVER THIS MORNING, JUST TO ASK US HOW WE DID."

THEY HURRIED ON, AND WERE SPEEDILY AT RANDALLS.--"WELL, MY DEAR," SAID
HE, AS THEY ENTERED THE ROOM--"I HAVE BROUGHT HER, AND NOW I HOPE YOU
WILL SOON BE BETTER. I SHALL LEAVE YOU TOGETHER. THERE IS NO USE IN
DELAY. I SHALL NOT BE FAR OFF, IF YOU WANT ME."--AND EMMA DISTINCTLY
HEARD HIM ADD, IN A LOWER TONE, BEFORE HE QUITTED THE ROOM,--"I HAVE
BEEN AS GOOD AS MY WORD. SHE HAS NOT THE LEAST IDEA."

MRS. WESTON WAS LOOKING SO ILL, AND HAD AN AIR OF SO MUCH PERTURBATION,
THAT EMMA'S UNEASINESS INCREASED; AND THE MOMENT THEY WERE ALONE, SHE
EAGERLY SAID,

"WHAT IS IT MY DEAR FRIEND? SOMETHING OF A VERY UNPLEASANT NATURE, I
FIND, HAS OCCURRED;--DO LET ME KNOW DIRECTLY WHAT IT IS. I HAVE BEEN
WALKING ALL THIS WAY IN COMPLETE SUSPENSE. WE BOTH ABHOR SUSPENSE.
DO NOT LET MINE CONTINUE LONGER. IT WILL DO YOU GOOD TO SPEAK OF YOUR
DISTRESS, WHATEVER IT MAY BE."

"HAVE YOU INDEED NO IDEA?" SAID MRS. WESTON IN A TREMBLING VOICE.
"CANNOT YOU, MY DEAR EMMA--CANNOT YOU FORM A GUESS AS TO WHAT YOU ARE TO
HEAR?"

"SO FAR AS THAT IT RELATES TO MR. FRANK CHURCHILL, I DO GUESS."

"YOU ARE RIGHT. IT DOES RELATE TO HIM, AND I WILL TELL YOU DIRECTLY;"
(RESUMING HER WORK, AND SEEMING RESOLVED AGAINST LOOKING UP.) "HE HAS
BEEN HERE THIS VERY MORNING, ON A MOST EXTRAORDINARY ERRAND. IT IS
IMPOSSIBLE TO EXPRESS OUR SURPRIZE. HE CAME TO SPEAK TO HIS FATHER ON A
SUBJECT,--TO ANNOUNCE AN ATTACHMENT--"

SHE STOPPED TO BREATHE. EMMA THOUGHT FIRST OF HERSELF, AND THEN OF
HARRIET.

"MORE THAN AN ATTACHMENT, INDEED," RESUMED MRS. WESTON; "AN
ENGAGEMENT--A POSITIVE ENGAGEMENT.--WHAT WILL YOU SAY, EMMA--WHAT WILL
ANY BODY SAY, WHEN IT IS KNOWN THAT FRANK CHURCHILL AND MISS FAIRFAX ARE
ENGAGED;--NAY, THAT THEY HAVE BEEN LONG ENGAGED!"

EMMA EVEN JUMPED WITH SURPRIZE;--AND, HORROR-STRUCK, EXCLAIMED,

"JANE FAIRFAX!--GOOD GOD! YOU ARE NOT SERIOUS? YOU DO NOT MEAN IT?"

"YOU MAY WELL BE AMAZED," RETURNED MRS. WESTON, STILL AVERTING HER EYES,
AND TALKING ON WITH EAGERNESS, THAT EMMA MIGHT HAVE TIME TO RECOVER--
"YOU MAY WELL BE AMAZED. BUT IT IS EVEN SO. THERE HAS BEEN A SOLEMN
ENGAGEMENT BETWEEN THEM EVER SINCE OCTOBER--FORMED AT WEYMOUTH, AND
KEPT A SECRET FROM EVERY BODY. NOT A CREATURE KNOWING IT BUT
THEMSELVES--NEITHER THE CAMPBELLS, NOR HER FAMILY, NOR HIS.--IT IS SO
WONDERFUL, THAT THOUGH PERFECTLY CONVINCED OF THE FACT, IT IS YET ALMOST
INCREDIBLE TO MYSELF. I CAN HARDLY BELIEVE IT.--I THOUGHT I KNEW HIM."

EMMA SCARCELY HEARD WHAT WAS SAID.--HER MIND WAS DIVIDED BETWEEN TWO
IDEAS--HER OWN FORMER CONVERSATIONS WITH HIM ABOUT MISS FAIRFAX; AND
POOR HARRIET;--AND FOR SOME TIME SHE COULD ONLY EXCLAIM, AND REQUIRE
CONFIRMATION, REPEATED CONFIRMATION.

"WELL," SAID SHE AT LAST, TRYING TO RECOVER HERSELF; "THIS IS A
CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH I MUST THINK OF AT LEAST HALF A DAY, BEFORE I CAN AT
ALL COMPREHEND IT. WHAT!--ENGAGED TO HER ALL THE WINTER--BEFORE EITHER
OF THEM CAME TO HIGHBURY?"

"ENGAGED SINCE OCTOBER,--SECRETLY ENGAGED.--IT HAS HURT ME, EMMA, VERY
MUCH. IT HAS HURT HIS FATHER EQUALLY. SOME PART OF HIS CONDUCT WE
CANNOT EXCUSE."

EMMA PONDERED A MOMENT, AND THEN REPLIED, "I WILL NOT PRETEND NOT TO
UNDERSTAND YOU; AND TO GIVE YOU ALL THE RELIEF IN MY POWER, BE ASSURED
THAT NO SUCH EFFECT HAS FOLLOWED HIS ATTENTIONS TO ME, AS YOU ARE
APPREHENSIVE OF."

MRS. WESTON LOOKED UP, AFRAID TO BELIEVE; BUT EMMA'S COUNTENANCE WAS AS
STEADY AS HER WORDS.

"THAT YOU MAY HAVE LESS DIFFICULTY IN BELIEVING THIS BOAST, OF MY
PRESENT PERFECT INDIFFERENCE," SHE CONTINUED, "I WILL FARTHER TELL YOU,
THAT THERE WAS A PERIOD IN THE EARLY PART OF OUR ACQUAINTANCE, WHEN I
DID LIKE HIM, WHEN I WAS VERY MUCH DISPOSED TO BE ATTACHED TO HIM--NAY,
WAS ATTACHED--AND HOW IT CAME TO CEASE, IS PERHAPS THE WONDER.
FORTUNATELY, HOWEVER, IT DID CEASE. I HAVE REALLY FOR SOME TIME PAST,
FOR AT LEAST THESE THREE MONTHS, CARED NOTHING ABOUT HIM. YOU MAY
BELIEVE ME, MRS. WESTON. THIS IS THE SIMPLE TRUTH."

MRS. WESTON KISSED HER WITH TEARS OF JOY; AND WHEN SHE COULD FIND
UTTERANCE, ASSURED HER, THAT THIS PROTESTATION HAD DONE HER MORE GOOD
THAN ANY THING ELSE IN THE WORLD COULD DO.

"MR. WESTON WILL BE ALMOST AS MUCH RELIEVED AS MYSELF," SAID SHE. "ON
THIS POINT WE HAVE BEEN WRETCHED. IT WAS OUR DARLING WISH THAT YOU
MIGHT BE ATTACHED TO EACH OTHER--AND WE WERE PERSUADED THAT IT WAS SO.--
IMAGINE WHAT WE HAVE BEEN FEELING ON YOUR ACCOUNT."

"I HAVE ESCAPED; AND THAT I SHOULD ESCAPE, MAY BE A MATTER OF GRATEFUL
WONDER TO YOU AND MYSELF. BUT THIS DOES NOT ACQUIT HIM, MRS. WESTON;
AND I MUST SAY, THAT I THINK HIM GREATLY TO BLAME. WHAT RIGHT HAD HE
TO COME AMONG US WITH AFFECTION AND FAITH ENGAGED, AND WITH MANNERS
SO VERY DISENGAGED? WHAT RIGHT HAD HE TO ENDEAVOUR TO PLEASE, AS
HE CERTAINLY DID--TO DISTINGUISH ANY ONE YOUNG WOMAN WITH PERSEVERING
ATTENTION, AS HE CERTAINLY DID--WHILE HE REALLY BELONGED TO
ANOTHER?--HOW COULD HE TELL WHAT MISCHIEF HE MIGHT BE DOING?--HOW COULD
HE TELL THAT HE MIGHT NOT BE MAKING ME IN LOVE WITH HIM?--VERY WRONG,
VERY WRONG INDEED."

"FROM SOMETHING THAT HE SAID, MY DEAR EMMA, I RATHER IMAGINE--"

"AND HOW COULD SHE BEAR SUCH BEHAVIOUR! COMPOSURE WITH A WITNESS!
TO LOOK ON, WHILE REPEATED ATTENTIONS WERE OFFERING TO ANOTHER WOMAN,
BEFORE HER FACE, AND NOT RESENT IT.--THAT IS A DEGREE OF PLACIDITY,
WHICH I CAN NEITHER COMPREHEND NOR RESPECT."

"THERE WERE MISUNDERSTANDINGS BETWEEN THEM, EMMA; HE SAID SO EXPRESSLY.
HE HAD NOT TIME TO ENTER INTO MUCH EXPLANATION. HE WAS HERE ONLY A
QUARTER OF AN HOUR, AND IN A STATE OF AGITATION WHICH DID NOT ALLOW
THE FULL USE EVEN OF THE TIME HE COULD STAY--BUT THAT THERE HAD BEEN
MISUNDERSTANDINGS HE DECIDEDLY SAID. THE PRESENT CRISIS, INDEED,
SEEMED TO BE BROUGHT ON BY THEM; AND THOSE MISUNDERSTANDINGS MIGHT VERY
POSSIBLY ARISE FROM THE IMPROPRIETY OF HIS CONDUCT."

"IMPROPRIETY! OH! MRS. WESTON--IT IS TOO CALM A CENSURE. MUCH, MUCH
BEYOND IMPROPRIETY!--IT HAS SUNK HIM, I CANNOT SAY HOW IT HAS SUNK HIM
IN MY OPINION. SO UNLIKE WHAT A MAN SHOULD BE!--NONE OF THAT UPRIGHT
INTEGRITY, THAT STRICT ADHERENCE TO TRUTH AND PRINCIPLE, THAT DISDAIN OF
TRICK AND LITTLENESS, WHICH A MAN SHOULD DISPLAY IN EVERY TRANSACTION OF
HIS LIFE."

"NAY, DEAR EMMA, NOW I MUST TAKE HIS PART; FOR THOUGH HE HAS BEEN WRONG
IN THIS INSTANCE, I HAVE KNOWN HIM LONG ENOUGH TO ANSWER FOR HIS HAVING
MANY, VERY MANY, GOOD QUALITIES; AND--"

"GOOD GOD!" CRIED EMMA, NOT ATTENDING TO HER.--"MRS. SMALLRIDGE, TOO!
JANE ACTUALLY ON THE POINT OF GOING AS GOVERNESS! WHAT COULD HE MEAN BY
SUCH HORRIBLE INDELICACY? TO SUFFER HER TO ENGAGE HERSELF--TO SUFFER HER
EVEN TO THINK OF SUCH A MEASURE!"

"HE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT IT, EMMA. ON THIS ARTICLE I CAN FULLY ACQUIT
HIM. IT WAS A PRIVATE RESOLUTION OF HERS, NOT COMMUNICATED TO HIM--OR AT
LEAST NOT COMMUNICATED IN A WAY TO CARRY CONVICTION.--TILL YESTERDAY, I
KNOW HE SAID HE WAS IN THE DARK AS TO HER PLANS. THEY BURST ON HIM, I DO
NOT KNOW HOW, BUT BY SOME LETTER OR MESSAGE--AND IT WAS THE DISCOVERY OF
WHAT SHE WAS DOING, OF THIS VERY PROJECT OF HERS, WHICH DETERMINED HIM
TO COME FORWARD AT ONCE, OWN IT ALL TO HIS UNCLE, THROW HIMSELF ON
HIS KINDNESS, AND, IN SHORT, PUT AN END TO THE MISERABLE STATE OF
CONCEALMENT THAT HAD BEEN CARRYING ON SO LONG."

EMMA BEGAN TO LISTEN BETTER.

"I AM TO HEAR FROM HIM SOON," CONTINUED MRS. WESTON. "HE TOLD ME AT
PARTING, THAT HE SHOULD SOON WRITE; AND HE SPOKE IN A MANNER WHICH
SEEMED TO PROMISE ME MANY PARTICULARS THAT COULD NOT BE GIVEN NOW. LET
US WAIT, THEREFORE, FOR THIS LETTER. IT MAY BRING MANY EXTENUATIONS. IT
MAY MAKE MANY THINGS INTELLIGIBLE AND EXCUSABLE WHICH NOW ARE NOT TO
BE UNDERSTOOD. DON'T LET US BE SEVERE, DON'T LET US BE IN A HURRY TO
CONDEMN HIM. LET US HAVE PATIENCE. I MUST LOVE HIM; AND NOW THAT I AM
SATISFIED ON ONE POINT, THE ONE MATERIAL POINT, I AM SINCERELY ANXIOUS
FOR ITS ALL TURNING OUT WELL, AND READY TO HOPE THAT IT MAY. THEY MUST
BOTH HAVE SUFFERED A GREAT DEAL UNDER SUCH A SYSTEM OF SECRESY AND
CONCEALMENT."

"HIS SUFFERINGS," REPLIED EMMA DRYLY, "DO NOT APPEAR TO HAVE DONE HIM
MUCH HARM. WELL, AND HOW DID MR. CHURCHILL TAKE IT?"

"MOST FAVOURABLY FOR HIS NEPHEW--GAVE HIS CONSENT WITH SCARCELY A
DIFFICULTY. CONCEIVE WHAT THE EVENTS OF A WEEK HAVE DONE IN THAT FAMILY!
WHILE POOR MRS. CHURCHILL LIVED, I SUPPOSE THERE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN A
HOPE, A CHANCE, A POSSIBILITY;--BUT SCARCELY ARE HER REMAINS AT REST IN
THE FAMILY VAULT, THAN HER HUSBAND IS PERSUADED TO ACT EXACTLY OPPOSITE
TO WHAT SHE WOULD HAVE REQUIRED. WHAT A BLESSING IT IS, WHEN UNDUE
INFLUENCE DOES NOT SURVIVE THE GRAVE!--HE GAVE HIS CONSENT WITH VERY
LITTLE PERSUASION."

"AH!" THOUGHT EMMA, "HE WOULD HAVE DONE AS MUCH FOR HARRIET."

"THIS WAS SETTLED LAST NIGHT, AND FRANK WAS OFF WITH THE LIGHT THIS
MORNING. HE STOPPED AT HIGHBURY, AT THE BATES'S, I FANCY, SOME TIME--AND
THEN CAME ON HITHER; BUT WAS IN SUCH A HURRY TO GET BACK TO HIS UNCLE,
TO WHOM HE IS JUST NOW MORE NECESSARY THAN EVER, THAT, AS I TELL YOU,
HE COULD STAY WITH US BUT A QUARTER OF AN HOUR.--HE WAS VERY MUCH
AGITATED--VERY MUCH, INDEED--TO A DEGREE THAT MADE HIM APPEAR QUITE
A DIFFERENT CREATURE FROM ANY THING I HAD EVER SEEN HIM BEFORE.--IN
ADDITION TO ALL THE REST, THERE HAD BEEN THE SHOCK OF FINDING HER SO
VERY UNWELL, WHICH HE HAD HAD NO PREVIOUS SUSPICION OF--AND THERE WAS
EVERY APPEARANCE OF HIS HAVING BEEN FEELING A GREAT DEAL."

"AND DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE THE AFFAIR TO HAVE BEEN CARRYING ON WITH SUCH
PERFECT SECRESY?--THE CAMPBELLS, THE DIXONS, DID NONE OF THEM KNOW OF
THE ENGAGEMENT?"

EMMA COULD NOT SPEAK THE NAME OF DIXON WITHOUT A LITTLE BLUSH.

"NONE; NOT ONE. HE POSITIVELY SAID THAT IT HAD BEEN KNOWN TO NO BEING IN
THE WORLD BUT THEIR TWO SELVES."

"WELL," SAID EMMA, "I SUPPOSE WE SHALL GRADUALLY GROW RECONCILED TO THE
IDEA, AND I WISH THEM VERY HAPPY. BUT I SHALL ALWAYS THINK IT A
VERY ABOMINABLE SORT OF PROCEEDING. WHAT HAS IT BEEN BUT A SYSTEM OF
HYPOCRISY AND DECEIT,--ESPIONAGE, AND TREACHERY?--TO COME AMONG US WITH
PROFESSIONS OF OPENNESS AND SIMPLICITY; AND SUCH A LEAGUE IN SECRET
TO JUDGE US ALL!--HERE HAVE WE BEEN, THE WHOLE WINTER AND SPRING,
COMPLETELY DUPED, FANCYING OURSELVES ALL ON AN EQUAL FOOTING OF TRUTH
AND HONOUR, WITH TWO PEOPLE IN THE MIDST OF US WHO MAY HAVE BEEN
CARRYING ROUND, COMPARING AND SITTING IN JUDGMENT ON SENTIMENTS AND
WORDS THAT WERE NEVER MEANT FOR BOTH TO HEAR.--THEY MUST TAKE THE
CONSEQUENCE, IF THEY HAVE HEARD EACH OTHER SPOKEN OF IN A WAY NOT
PERFECTLY AGREEABLE!"

"I AM QUITE EASY ON THAT HEAD," REPLIED MRS. WESTON. "I AM VERY SURE
THAT I NEVER SAID ANY THING OF EITHER TO THE OTHER, WHICH BOTH MIGHT NOT
HAVE HEARD."

"YOU ARE IN LUCK.--YOUR ONLY BLUNDER WAS CONFINED TO MY EAR, WHEN YOU
IMAGINED A CERTAIN FRIEND OF OURS IN LOVE WITH THE LADY."

"TRUE. BUT AS I HAVE ALWAYS HAD A THOROUGHLY GOOD OPINION OF MISS
FAIRFAX, I NEVER COULD, UNDER ANY BLUNDER, HAVE SPOKEN ILL OF HER; AND
AS TO SPEAKING ILL OF HIM, THERE I MUST HAVE BEEN SAFE."

AT THIS MOMENT MR. WESTON APPEARED AT A LITTLE DISTANCE FROM THE WINDOW,
EVIDENTLY ON THE WATCH. HIS WIFE GAVE HIM A LOOK WHICH INVITED HIM
IN; AND, WHILE HE WAS COMING ROUND, ADDED, "NOW, DEAREST EMMA, LET ME
INTREAT YOU TO SAY AND LOOK EVERY THING THAT MAY SET HIS HEART AT EASE,
AND INCLINE HIM TO BE SATISFIED WITH THE MATCH. LET US MAKE THE BEST OF
IT--AND, INDEED, ALMOST EVERY THING MAY BE FAIRLY SAID IN HER FAVOUR. IT
IS NOT A CONNEXION TO GRATIFY; BUT IF MR. CHURCHILL DOES NOT FEEL THAT,
WHY SHOULD WE? AND IT MAY BE A VERY FORTUNATE CIRCUMSTANCE FOR HIM, FOR
FRANK, I MEAN, THAT HE SHOULD HAVE ATTACHED HIMSELF TO A GIRL OF SUCH
STEADINESS OF CHARACTER AND GOOD JUDGMENT AS I HAVE ALWAYS GIVEN HER
CREDIT FOR--AND STILL AM DISPOSED TO GIVE HER CREDIT FOR, IN SPITE OF
THIS ONE GREAT DEVIATION FROM THE STRICT RULE OF RIGHT. AND HOW MUCH MAY
BE SAID IN HER SITUATION FOR EVEN THAT ERROR!"

"MUCH, INDEED!" CRIED EMMA FEELINGLY. "IF A WOMAN CAN EVER BE
EXCUSED FOR THINKING ONLY OF HERSELF, IT IS IN A SITUATION LIKE JANE
FAIRFAX'S.--OF SUCH, ONE MAY ALMOST SAY, THAT 'THE WORLD IS NOT THEIR'S,
NOR THE WORLD'S LAW.'"

SHE MET MR. WESTON ON HIS ENTRANCE, WITH A SMILING COUNTENANCE,
EXCLAIMING,

"A VERY PRETTY TRICK YOU HAVE BEEN PLAYING ME, UPON MY WORD! THIS WAS A
DEVICE, I SUPPOSE, TO SPORT WITH MY CURIOSITY, AND EXERCISE MY TALENT OF
GUESSING. BUT YOU REALLY FRIGHTENED ME. I THOUGHT YOU HAD LOST HALF
YOUR PROPERTY, AT LEAST. AND HERE, INSTEAD OF ITS BEING A MATTER OF
CONDOLENCE, IT TURNS OUT TO BE ONE OF CONGRATULATION.--I CONGRATULATE
YOU, MR. WESTON, WITH ALL MY HEART, ON THE PROSPECT OF HAVING ONE OF THE
MOST LOVELY AND ACCOMPLISHED YOUNG WOMEN IN ENGLAND FOR YOUR DAUGHTER."

A GLANCE OR TWO BETWEEN HIM AND HIS WIFE, CONVINCED HIM THAT ALL WAS AS
RIGHT AS THIS SPEECH PROCLAIMED; AND ITS HAPPY EFFECT ON HIS SPIRITS WAS
IMMEDIATE. HIS AIR AND VOICE RECOVERED THEIR USUAL BRISKNESS: HE SHOOK
HER HEARTILY AND GRATEFULLY BY THE HAND, AND ENTERED ON THE SUBJECT IN
A MANNER TO PROVE, THAT HE NOW ONLY WANTED TIME AND PERSUASION TO THINK
THE ENGAGEMENT NO VERY BAD THING. HIS COMPANIONS SUGGESTED ONLY WHAT
COULD PALLIATE IMPRUDENCE, OR SMOOTH OBJECTIONS; AND BY THE TIME THEY
HAD TALKED IT ALL OVER TOGETHER, AND HE HAD TALKED IT ALL OVER AGAIN
WITH EMMA, IN THEIR WALK BACK TO HARTFIELD, HE WAS BECOME PERFECTLY
RECONCILED, AND NOT FAR FROM THINKING IT THE VERY BEST THING THAT FRANK
COULD POSSIBLY HAVE DONE.



CHAPTER XI


"HARRIET, POOR HARRIET!"--THOSE WERE THE WORDS; IN THEM LAY THE
TORMENTING IDEAS WHICH EMMA COULD NOT GET RID OF, AND WHICH CONSTITUTED
THE REAL MISERY OF THE BUSINESS TO HER. FRANK CHURCHILL HAD BEHAVED VERY
ILL BY HERSELF--VERY ILL IN MANY WAYS,--BUT IT WAS NOT SO MUCH HIS
BEHAVIOUR AS HER OWN, WHICH MADE HER SO ANGRY WITH HIM. IT WAS THE
SCRAPE WHICH HE HAD DRAWN HER INTO ON HARRIET'S ACCOUNT, THAT GAVE THE
DEEPEST HUE TO HIS OFFENCE.--POOR HARRIET! TO BE A SECOND TIME THE
DUPE OF HER MISCONCEPTIONS AND FLATTERY. MR. KNIGHTLEY HAD SPOKEN
PROPHETICALLY, WHEN HE ONCE SAID, "EMMA, YOU HAVE BEEN NO FRIEND
TO HARRIET SMITH."--SHE WAS AFRAID SHE HAD DONE HER NOTHING BUT
DISSERVICE.--IT WAS TRUE THAT SHE HAD NOT TO CHARGE HERSELF, IN THIS
INSTANCE AS IN THE FORMER, WITH BEING THE SOLE AND ORIGINAL AUTHOR OF
THE MISCHIEF; WITH HAVING SUGGESTED SUCH FEELINGS AS MIGHT OTHERWISE
NEVER HAVE ENTERED HARRIET'S IMAGINATION; FOR HARRIET HAD ACKNOWLEDGED
HER ADMIRATION AND PREFERENCE OF FRANK CHURCHILL BEFORE SHE HAD EVER
GIVEN HER A HINT ON THE SUBJECT; BUT SHE FELT COMPLETELY GUILTY
OF HAVING ENCOURAGED WHAT SHE MIGHT HAVE REPRESSED. SHE MIGHT HAVE
PREVENTED THE INDULGENCE AND INCREASE OF SUCH SENTIMENTS. HER INFLUENCE
WOULD HAVE BEEN ENOUGH. AND NOW SHE WAS VERY CONSCIOUS THAT SHE OUGHT
TO HAVE PREVENTED THEM.--SHE FELT THAT SHE HAD BEEN RISKING HER FRIEND'S
HAPPINESS ON MOST INSUFFICIENT GROUNDS. COMMON SENSE WOULD HAVE DIRECTED
HER TO TELL HARRIET, THAT SHE MUST NOT ALLOW HERSELF TO THINK OF HIM,
AND THAT THERE WERE FIVE HUNDRED CHANCES TO ONE AGAINST HIS EVER CARING
FOR HER.--"BUT, WITH COMMON SENSE," SHE ADDED, "I AM AFRAID I HAVE HAD
LITTLE TO DO."

SHE WAS EXTREMELY ANGRY WITH HERSELF. IF SHE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN ANGRY
WITH FRANK CHURCHILL TOO, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DREADFUL.--AS FOR JANE
FAIRFAX, SHE MIGHT AT LEAST RELIEVE HER FEELINGS FROM ANY PRESENT
SOLICITUDE ON HER ACCOUNT. HARRIET WOULD BE ANXIETY ENOUGH; SHE NEED
NO LONGER BE UNHAPPY ABOUT JANE, WHOSE TROUBLES AND WHOSE ILL-HEALTH
HAVING, OF COURSE, THE SAME ORIGIN, MUST BE EQUALLY UNDER CURE.--HER
DAYS OF INSIGNIFICANCE AND EVIL WERE OVER.--SHE WOULD SOON BE WELL, AND
HAPPY, AND PROSPEROUS.--EMMA COULD NOW IMAGINE WHY HER OWN ATTENTIONS
HAD BEEN SLIGHTED. THIS DISCOVERY LAID MANY SMALLER MATTERS OPEN. NO
DOUBT IT HAD BEEN FROM JEALOUSY.--IN JANE'S EYES SHE HAD BEEN A RIVAL;
AND WELL MIGHT ANY THING SHE COULD OFFER OF ASSISTANCE OR REGARD BE
REPULSED. AN AIRING IN THE HARTFIELD CARRIAGE WOULD HAVE BEEN THE RACK,
AND ARROWROOT FROM THE HARTFIELD STOREROOM MUST HAVE BEEN POISON. SHE
UNDERSTOOD IT ALL; AND AS FAR AS HER MIND COULD DISENGAGE ITSELF FROM
THE INJUSTICE AND SELFISHNESS OF ANGRY FEELINGS, SHE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT
JANE FAIRFAX WOULD HAVE NEITHER ELEVATION NOR HAPPINESS BEYOND HER
DESERT. BUT POOR HARRIET WAS SUCH AN ENGROSSING CHARGE! THERE WAS LITTLE
SYMPATHY TO BE SPARED FOR ANY BODY ELSE. EMMA WAS SADLY FEARFUL
THAT THIS SECOND DISAPPOINTMENT WOULD BE MORE SEVERE THAN THE FIRST.
CONSIDERING THE VERY SUPERIOR CLAIMS OF THE OBJECT, IT OUGHT; AND
JUDGING BY ITS APPARENTLY STRONGER EFFECT ON HARRIET'S MIND, PRODUCING
RESERVE AND SELF-COMMAND, IT WOULD.--SHE MUST COMMUNICATE THE PAINFUL
TRUTH, HOWEVER, AND AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. AN INJUNCTION OF SECRESY HAD
BEEN AMONG MR. WESTON'S PARTING WORDS. "FOR THE PRESENT, THE WHOLE
AFFAIR WAS TO BE COMPLETELY A SECRET. MR. CHURCHILL HAD MADE A POINT OF
IT, AS A TOKEN OF RESPECT TO THE WIFE HE HAD SO VERY RECENTLY LOST;
AND EVERY BODY ADMITTED IT TO BE NO MORE THAN DUE DECORUM."--EMMA HAD
PROMISED; BUT STILL HARRIET MUST BE EXCEPTED. IT WAS HER SUPERIOR DUTY.

IN SPITE OF HER VEXATION, SHE COULD NOT HELP FEELING IT ALMOST
RIDICULOUS, THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE THE VERY SAME DISTRESSING AND DELICATE
OFFICE TO PERFORM BY HARRIET, WHICH MRS. WESTON HAD JUST GONE THROUGH BY
HERSELF. THE INTELLIGENCE, WHICH HAD BEEN SO ANXIOUSLY ANNOUNCED TO HER,
SHE WAS NOW TO BE ANXIOUSLY ANNOUNCING TO ANOTHER. HER HEART BEAT QUICK
ON HEARING HARRIET'S FOOTSTEP AND VOICE; SO, SHE SUPPOSED, HAD POOR MRS.
WESTON FELT WHEN SHE WAS APPROACHING RANDALLS. COULD THE EVENT OF
THE DISCLOSURE BEAR AN EQUAL RESEMBLANCE!--BUT OF THAT, UNFORTUNATELY,
THERE COULD BE NO CHANCE.

"WELL, MISS WOODHOUSE!" CRIED HARRIET, COMING EAGERLY INTO THE ROOM--"IS
NOT THIS THE ODDEST NEWS THAT EVER WAS?"

"WHAT NEWS DO YOU MEAN?" REPLIED EMMA, UNABLE TO GUESS, BY LOOK OR
VOICE, WHETHER HARRIET COULD INDEED HAVE RECEIVED ANY HINT.

"ABOUT JANE FAIRFAX. DID YOU EVER HEAR ANY THING SO STRANGE? OH!--YOU
NEED NOT BE AFRAID OF OWNING IT TO ME, FOR MR. WESTON HAS TOLD ME
HIMSELF. I MET HIM JUST NOW. HE TOLD ME IT WAS TO BE A GREAT SECRET;
AND, THEREFORE, I SHOULD NOT THINK OF MENTIONING IT TO ANY BODY BUT YOU,
BUT HE SAID YOU KNEW IT."

"WHAT DID MR. WESTON TELL YOU?"--SAID EMMA, STILL PERPLEXED.

"OH! HE TOLD ME ALL ABOUT IT; THAT JANE FAIRFAX AND MR. FRANK CHURCHILL
ARE TO BE MARRIED, AND THAT THEY HAVE BEEN PRIVATELY ENGAGED TO ONE
ANOTHER THIS LONG WHILE. HOW VERY ODD!"

IT WAS, INDEED, SO ODD; HARRIET'S BEHAVIOUR WAS SO EXTREMELY ODD,
THAT EMMA DID NOT KNOW HOW TO UNDERSTAND IT. HER CHARACTER APPEARED
ABSOLUTELY CHANGED. SHE SEEMED TO PROPOSE SHEWING NO AGITATION, OR
DISAPPOINTMENT, OR PECULIAR CONCERN IN THE DISCOVERY. EMMA LOOKED AT
HER, QUITE UNABLE TO SPEAK.

"HAD YOU ANY IDEA," CRIED HARRIET, "OF HIS BEING IN LOVE WITH HER?--YOU,
PERHAPS, MIGHT.--YOU (BLUSHING AS SHE SPOKE) WHO CAN SEE INTO EVERY
BODY'S HEART; BUT NOBODY ELSE--"

"UPON MY WORD," SAID EMMA, "I BEGIN TO DOUBT MY HAVING ANY SUCH TALENT.
CAN YOU SERIOUSLY ASK ME, HARRIET, WHETHER I IMAGINED HIM ATTACHED
TO ANOTHER WOMAN AT THE VERY TIME THAT I WAS--TACITLY, IF NOT
OPENLY--ENCOURAGING YOU TO GIVE WAY TO YOUR OWN FEELINGS?--I NEVER
HAD THE SLIGHTEST SUSPICION, TILL WITHIN THE LAST HOUR, OF MR. FRANK
CHURCHILL'S HAVING THE LEAST REGARD FOR JANE FAIRFAX. YOU MAY BE VERY
SURE THAT IF I HAD, I SHOULD HAVE CAUTIONED YOU ACCORDINGLY."

"ME!" CRIED HARRIET, COLOURING, AND ASTONISHED. "WHY SHOULD YOU CAUTION
ME?--YOU DO NOT THINK I CARE ABOUT MR. FRANK CHURCHILL."

"I AM DELIGHTED TO HEAR YOU SPEAK SO STOUTLY ON THE SUBJECT," REPLIED
EMMA, SMILING; "BUT YOU DO NOT MEAN TO DENY THAT THERE WAS A TIME--AND
NOT VERY DISTANT EITHER--WHEN YOU GAVE ME REASON TO UNDERSTAND THAT YOU
DID CARE ABOUT HIM?"

"HIM!--NEVER, NEVER. DEAR MISS WOODHOUSE, HOW COULD YOU SO MISTAKE ME?"
TURNING AWAY DISTRESSED.

"HARRIET!" CRIED EMMA, AFTER A MOMENT'S PAUSE--"WHAT DO YOU MEAN?--GOOD
HEAVEN! WHAT DO YOU MEAN?--MISTAKE YOU!--AM I TO SUPPOSE THEN?--"

SHE COULD NOT SPEAK ANOTHER WORD.--HER VOICE WAS LOST; AND SHE SAT DOWN,
WAITING IN GREAT TERROR TILL HARRIET SHOULD ANSWER.

HARRIET, WHO WAS STANDING AT SOME DISTANCE, AND WITH FACE TURNED FROM
HER, DID NOT IMMEDIATELY SAY ANY THING; AND WHEN SHE DID SPEAK, IT WAS
IN A VOICE NEARLY AS AGITATED AS EMMA'S.

"I SHOULD NOT HAVE THOUGHT IT POSSIBLE," SHE BEGAN, "THAT YOU COULD HAVE
MISUNDERSTOOD ME! I KNOW WE AGREED NEVER TO NAME HIM--BUT CONSIDERING
HOW INFINITELY SUPERIOR HE IS TO EVERY BODY ELSE, I SHOULD NOT HAVE
THOUGHT IT POSSIBLE THAT I COULD BE SUPPOSED TO MEAN ANY OTHER PERSON.
MR. FRANK CHURCHILL, INDEED! I DO NOT KNOW WHO WOULD EVER LOOK AT HIM IN
THE COMPANY OF THE OTHER. I HOPE I HAVE A BETTER TASTE THAN TO THINK OF
MR. FRANK CHURCHILL, WHO IS LIKE NOBODY BY HIS SIDE. AND THAT YOU SHOULD
HAVE BEEN SO MISTAKEN, IS AMAZING!--I AM SURE, BUT FOR BELIEVING THAT
YOU ENTIRELY APPROVED AND MEANT TO ENCOURAGE ME IN MY ATTACHMENT, I
SHOULD HAVE CONSIDERED IT AT FIRST TOO GREAT A PRESUMPTION ALMOST,
TO DARE TO THINK OF HIM. AT FIRST, IF YOU HAD NOT TOLD ME THAT MORE
WONDERFUL THINGS HAD HAPPENED; THAT THERE HAD BEEN MATCHES OF GREATER
DISPARITY (THOSE WERE YOUR VERY WORDS);--I SHOULD NOT HAVE DARED TO
GIVE WAY TO--I SHOULD NOT HAVE THOUGHT IT POSSIBLE--BUT IF YOU, WHO
HAD BEEN ALWAYS ACQUAINTED WITH HIM--"

"HARRIET!" CRIED EMMA, COLLECTING HERSELF RESOLUTELY--"LET US UNDERSTAND
EACH OTHER NOW, WITHOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF FARTHER MISTAKE. ARE YOU
SPEAKING OF--MR. KNIGHTLEY?"

"TO BE SURE I AM. I NEVER COULD HAVE AN IDEA OF ANY BODY ELSE--AND SO
I THOUGHT YOU KNEW. WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT HIM, IT WAS AS CLEAR AS
POSSIBLE."

"NOT QUITE," RETURNED EMMA, WITH FORCED CALMNESS, "FOR ALL THAT YOU THEN
SAID, APPEARED TO ME TO RELATE TO A DIFFERENT PERSON. I COULD ALMOST
ASSERT THAT YOU HAD NAMED MR. FRANK CHURCHILL. I AM SURE THE SERVICE
MR. FRANK CHURCHILL HAD RENDERED YOU, IN PROTECTING YOU FROM THE
GIPSIES, WAS SPOKEN OF."

"OH! MISS WOODHOUSE, HOW YOU DO FORGET!"

"MY DEAR HARRIET, I PERFECTLY REMEMBER THE SUBSTANCE OF WHAT I SAID ON
THE OCCASION. I TOLD YOU THAT I DID NOT WONDER AT YOUR ATTACHMENT;
THAT CONSIDERING THE SERVICE HE HAD RENDERED YOU, IT WAS EXTREMELY
NATURAL:--AND YOU AGREED TO IT, EXPRESSING YOURSELF VERY WARMLY AS TO
YOUR SENSE OF THAT SERVICE, AND MENTIONING EVEN WHAT YOUR SENSATIONS HAD
BEEN IN SEEING HIM COME FORWARD TO YOUR RESCUE.--THE IMPRESSION OF IT IS
STRONG ON MY MEMORY."

"OH, DEAR," CRIED HARRIET, "NOW I RECOLLECT WHAT YOU MEAN; BUT I
WAS THINKING OF SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT AT THE TIME. IT WAS NOT THE
GIPSIES--IT WAS NOT MR. FRANK CHURCHILL THAT I MEANT. NO! (WITH SOME
ELEVATION) I WAS THINKING OF A MUCH MORE PRECIOUS CIRCUMSTANCE--OF MR.
KNIGHTLEY'S COMING AND ASKING ME TO DANCE, WHEN MR. ELTON WOULD NOT
STAND UP WITH ME; AND WHEN THERE WAS NO OTHER PARTNER IN THE ROOM. THAT
WAS THE KIND ACTION; THAT WAS THE NOBLE BENEVOLENCE AND GENEROSITY; THAT
WAS THE SERVICE WHICH MADE ME BEGIN TO FEEL HOW SUPERIOR HE WAS TO EVERY
OTHER BEING UPON EARTH."

"GOOD GOD!" CRIED EMMA, "THIS HAS BEEN A MOST UNFORTUNATE--MOST
DEPLORABLE MISTAKE!--WHAT IS TO BE DONE?"

"YOU WOULD NOT HAVE ENCOURAGED ME, THEN, IF YOU HAD UNDERSTOOD ME? AT
LEAST, HOWEVER, I CANNOT BE WORSE OFF THAN I SHOULD HAVE BEEN, IF THE
OTHER HAD BEEN THE PERSON; AND NOW--IT IS POSSIBLE--"

SHE PAUSED A FEW MOMENTS. EMMA COULD NOT SPEAK.

"I DO NOT WONDER, MISS WOODHOUSE," SHE RESUMED, "THAT YOU SHOULD FEEL A
GREAT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO, AS TO ME OR AS TO ANY BODY. YOU MUST
THINK ONE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION TIMES MORE ABOVE ME THAN THE OTHER. BUT
I HOPE, MISS WOODHOUSE, THAT SUPPOSING--THAT IF--STRANGE AS IT MAY
APPEAR--. BUT YOU KNOW THEY WERE YOUR OWN WORDS, THAT MORE WONDERFUL
THINGS HAD HAPPENED, MATCHES OF GREATER DISPARITY HAD TAKEN PLACE THAN
BETWEEN MR. FRANK CHURCHILL AND ME; AND, THEREFORE, IT SEEMS AS IF SUCH
A THING EVEN AS THIS, MAY HAVE OCCURRED BEFORE--AND IF I SHOULD BE SO
FORTUNATE, BEYOND EXPRESSION, AS TO--IF MR. KNIGHTLEY SHOULD REALLY--IF
HE DOES NOT MIND THE DISPARITY, I HOPE, DEAR MISS WOODHOUSE, YOU WILL
NOT SET YOURSELF AGAINST IT, AND TRY TO PUT DIFFICULTIES IN THE WAY. BUT
YOU ARE TOO GOOD FOR THAT, I AM SURE."

HARRIET WAS STANDING AT ONE OF THE WINDOWS. EMMA TURNED ROUND TO LOOK AT
HER IN CONSTERNATION, AND HASTILY SAID,

"HAVE YOU ANY IDEA OF MR. KNIGHTLEY'S RETURNING YOUR AFFECTION?"

"YES," REPLIED HARRIET MODESTLY, BUT NOT FEARFULLY--"I MUST SAY THAT I
HAVE."

EMMA'S EYES WERE INSTANTLY WITHDRAWN; AND SHE SAT SILENTLY MEDITATING,
IN A FIXED ATTITUDE, FOR A FEW MINUTES. A FEW MINUTES WERE SUFFICIENT
FOR MAKING HER ACQUAINTED WITH HER OWN HEART. A MIND LIKE HERS,
ONCE OPENING TO SUSPICION, MADE RAPID PROGRESS. SHE TOUCHED--SHE
ADMITTED--SHE ACKNOWLEDGED THE WHOLE TRUTH. WHY WAS IT SO MUCH WORSE
THAT HARRIET SHOULD BE IN LOVE WITH MR. KNIGHTLEY, THAN WITH FRANK
CHURCHILL? WHY WAS THE EVIL SO DREADFULLY INCREASED BY HARRIET'S HAVING
SOME HOPE OF A RETURN? IT DARTED THROUGH HER, WITH THE SPEED OF AN
ARROW, THAT MR. KNIGHTLEY MUST MARRY NO ONE BUT HERSELF!

HER OWN CONDUCT, AS WELL AS HER OWN HEART, WAS BEFORE HER IN THE SAME
FEW MINUTES. SHE SAW IT ALL WITH A CLEARNESS WHICH HAD NEVER BLESSED
HER BEFORE. HOW IMPROPERLY HAD SHE BEEN ACTING BY HARRIET! HOW
INCONSIDERATE, HOW INDELICATE, HOW IRRATIONAL, HOW UNFEELING HAD BEEN
HER CONDUCT! WHAT BLINDNESS, WHAT MADNESS, HAD LED HER ON! IT STRUCK HER
WITH DREADFUL FORCE, AND SHE WAS READY TO GIVE IT EVERY BAD NAME IN THE
WORLD. SOME PORTION OF RESPECT FOR HERSELF, HOWEVER, IN SPITE OF ALL
THESE DEMERITS--SOME CONCERN FOR HER OWN APPEARANCE, AND A STRONG SENSE
OF JUSTICE BY HARRIET--(THERE WOULD BE NO NEED OF COMPASSION TO THE
GIRL WHO BELIEVED HERSELF LOVED BY MR. KNIGHTLEY--BUT JUSTICE REQUIRED
THAT SHE SHOULD NOT BE MADE UNHAPPY BY ANY COLDNESS NOW,) GAVE EMMA THE
RESOLUTION TO SIT AND ENDURE FARTHER WITH CALMNESS, WITH EVEN APPARENT
KINDNESS.--FOR HER OWN ADVANTAGE INDEED, IT WAS FIT THAT THE UTMOST
EXTENT OF HARRIET'S HOPES SHOULD BE ENQUIRED INTO; AND HARRIET HAD DONE
NOTHING TO FORFEIT THE REGARD AND INTEREST WHICH HAD BEEN SO VOLUNTARILY
FORMED AND MAINTAINED--OR TO DESERVE TO BE SLIGHTED BY THE PERSON, WHOSE
COUNSELS HAD NEVER LED HER RIGHT.--ROUSING FROM REFLECTION, THEREFORE,
AND SUBDUING HER EMOTION, SHE TURNED TO HARRIET AGAIN, AND, IN A MORE
INVITING ACCENT, RENEWED THE CONVERSATION; FOR AS TO THE SUBJECT WHICH
HAD FIRST INTRODUCED IT, THE WONDERFUL STORY OF JANE FAIRFAX, THAT WAS
QUITE SUNK AND LOST.--NEITHER OF THEM THOUGHT BUT OF MR. KNIGHTLEY AND
THEMSELVES.

HARRIET, WHO HAD BEEN STANDING IN NO UNHAPPY REVERIE, WAS YET VERY GLAD
TO BE CALLED FROM IT, BY THE NOW ENCOURAGING MANNER OF SUCH A JUDGE, AND
SUCH A FRIEND AS MISS WOODHOUSE, AND ONLY WANTED INVITATION, TO GIVE
THE HISTORY OF HER HOPES WITH GREAT, THOUGH TREMBLING DELIGHT.--EMMA'S
TREMBLINGS AS SHE ASKED, AND AS SHE LISTENED, WERE BETTER CONCEALED THAN
HARRIET'S, BUT THEY WERE NOT LESS. HER VOICE WAS NOT UNSTEADY; BUT HER
MIND WAS IN ALL THE PERTURBATION THAT SUCH A DEVELOPMENT OF SELF, SUCH
A BURST OF THREATENING EVIL, SUCH A CONFUSION OF SUDDEN AND PERPLEXING
EMOTIONS, MUST CREATE.--SHE LISTENED WITH MUCH INWARD SUFFERING, BUT
WITH GREAT OUTWARD PATIENCE, TO HARRIET'S DETAIL.--METHODICAL, OR WELL
ARRANGED, OR VERY WELL DELIVERED, IT COULD NOT BE EXPECTED TO BE; BUT IT
CONTAINED, WHEN SEPARATED FROM ALL THE FEEBLENESS AND TAUTOLOGY OF
THE NARRATION, A SUBSTANCE TO SINK HER SPIRIT--ESPECIALLY WITH THE
CORROBORATING CIRCUMSTANCES, WHICH HER OWN MEMORY BROUGHT IN FAVOUR OF
MR. KNIGHTLEY'S MOST IMPROVED OPINION OF HARRIET.

HARRIET HAD BEEN CONSCIOUS OF A DIFFERENCE IN HIS BEHAVIOUR EVER SINCE
THOSE TWO DECISIVE DANCES.--EMMA KNEW THAT HE HAD, ON THAT OCCASION,
FOUND HER MUCH SUPERIOR TO HIS EXPECTATION. FROM THAT EVENING, OR AT
LEAST FROM THE TIME OF MISS WOODHOUSE'S ENCOURAGING HER TO THINK OF HIM,
HARRIET HAD BEGUN TO BE SENSIBLE OF HIS TALKING TO HER MUCH MORE THAN HE
HAD BEEN USED TO DO, AND OF HIS HAVING INDEED QUITE A DIFFERENT MANNER
TOWARDS HER; A MANNER OF KINDNESS AND SWEETNESS!--LATTERLY SHE HAD BEEN
MORE AND MORE AWARE OF IT. WHEN THEY HAD BEEN ALL WALKING TOGETHER,
HE HAD SO OFTEN COME AND WALKED BY HER, AND TALKED SO VERY
DELIGHTFULLY!--HE SEEMED TO WANT TO BE ACQUAINTED WITH HER. EMMA KNEW IT
TO HAVE BEEN VERY MUCH THE CASE. SHE HAD OFTEN OBSERVED THE CHANGE, TO
ALMOST THE SAME EXTENT.--HARRIET REPEATED EXPRESSIONS OF APPROBATION
AND PRAISE FROM HIM--AND EMMA FELT THEM TO BE IN THE CLOSEST AGREEMENT
WITH WHAT SHE HAD KNOWN OF HIS OPINION OF HARRIET. HE PRAISED HER FOR
BEING WITHOUT ART OR AFFECTATION, FOR HAVING SIMPLE, HONEST, GENEROUS,
FEELINGS.--SHE KNEW THAT HE SAW SUCH RECOMMENDATIONS IN HARRIET; HE
HAD DWELT ON THEM TO HER MORE THAN ONCE.--MUCH THAT LIVED IN HARRIET'S
MEMORY, MANY LITTLE PARTICULARS OF THE NOTICE SHE HAD RECEIVED FROM
HIM, A LOOK, A SPEECH, A REMOVAL FROM ONE CHAIR TO ANOTHER, A COMPLIMENT
IMPLIED, A PREFERENCE INFERRED, HAD BEEN UNNOTICED, BECAUSE UNSUSPECTED,
BY EMMA. CIRCUMSTANCES THAT MIGHT SWELL TO HALF AN HOUR'S RELATION,
AND CONTAINED MULTIPLIED PROOFS TO HER WHO HAD SEEN THEM, HAD PASSED
UNDISCERNED BY HER WHO NOW HEARD THEM; BUT THE TWO LATEST OCCURRENCES TO
BE MENTIONED, THE TWO OF STRONGEST PROMISE TO HARRIET, WERE NOT WITHOUT
SOME DEGREE OF WITNESS FROM EMMA HERSELF.--THE FIRST, WAS HIS WALKING
WITH HER APART FROM THE OTHERS, IN THE LIME-WALK AT DONWELL, WHERE THEY
HAD BEEN WALKING SOME TIME BEFORE EMMA CAME, AND HE HAD TAKEN PAINS (AS
SHE WAS CONVINCED) TO DRAW HER FROM THE REST TO HIMSELF--AND AT FIRST,
HE HAD TALKED TO HER IN A MORE PARTICULAR WAY THAN HE HAD EVER DONE
BEFORE, IN A VERY PARTICULAR WAY INDEED!--(HARRIET COULD NOT RECALL
IT WITHOUT A BLUSH.) HE SEEMED TO BE ALMOST ASKING HER, WHETHER HER
AFFECTIONS WERE ENGAGED.--BUT AS SOON AS SHE (MISS WOODHOUSE) APPEARED
LIKELY TO JOIN THEM, HE CHANGED THE SUBJECT, AND BEGAN TALKING ABOUT
FARMING:--THE SECOND, WAS HIS HAVING SAT TALKING WITH HER NEARLY HALF
AN HOUR BEFORE EMMA CAME BACK FROM HER VISIT, THE VERY LAST MORNING OF
HIS BEING AT HARTFIELD--THOUGH, WHEN HE FIRST CAME IN, HE HAD SAID THAT
HE COULD NOT STAY FIVE MINUTES--AND HIS HAVING TOLD HER, DURING THEIR
CONVERSATION, THAT THOUGH HE MUST GO TO LONDON, IT WAS VERY MUCH AGAINST
HIS INCLINATION THAT HE LEFT HOME AT ALL, WHICH WAS MUCH MORE (AS
EMMA FELT) THAN HE HAD ACKNOWLEDGED TO HER. THE SUPERIOR DEGREE OF
CONFIDENCE TOWARDS HARRIET, WHICH THIS ONE ARTICLE MARKED, GAVE HER
SEVERE PAIN.

ON THE SUBJECT OF THE FIRST OF THE TWO CIRCUMSTANCES, SHE DID, AFTER A
LITTLE REFLECTION, VENTURE THE FOLLOWING QUESTION. "MIGHT HE NOT?--IS
NOT IT POSSIBLE, THAT WHEN ENQUIRING, AS YOU THOUGHT, INTO THE STATE OF
YOUR AFFECTIONS, HE MIGHT BE ALLUDING TO MR. MARTIN--HE MIGHT HAVE
MR. MARTIN'S INTEREST IN VIEW? BUT HARRIET REJECTED THE SUSPICION WITH
SPIRIT.

"MR. MARTIN! NO INDEED!--THERE WAS NOT A HINT OF MR. MARTIN. I HOPE I
KNOW BETTER NOW, THAN TO CARE FOR MR. MARTIN, OR TO BE SUSPECTED OF IT."

WHEN HARRIET HAD CLOSED HER EVIDENCE, SHE APPEALED TO HER DEAR MISS
WOODHOUSE, TO SAY WHETHER SHE HAD NOT GOOD GROUND FOR HOPE.

"I NEVER SHOULD HAVE PRESUMED TO THINK OF IT AT FIRST," SAID SHE, "BUT
FOR YOU. YOU TOLD ME TO OBSERVE HIM CAREFULLY, AND LET HIS BEHAVIOUR
BE THE RULE OF MINE--AND SO I HAVE. BUT NOW I SEEM TO FEEL THAT I MAY
DESERVE HIM; AND THAT IF HE DOES CHUSE ME, IT WILL NOT BE ANY THING SO
VERY WONDERFUL."

THE BITTER FEELINGS OCCASIONED BY THIS SPEECH, THE MANY BITTER FEELINGS,
MADE THE UTMOST EXERTION NECESSARY ON EMMA'S SIDE, TO ENABLE HER TO SAY
ON REPLY,

"HARRIET, I WILL ONLY VENTURE TO DECLARE, THAT MR. KNIGHTLEY IS THE LAST
MAN IN THE WORLD, WHO WOULD INTENTIONALLY GIVE ANY WOMAN THE IDEA OF HIS
FEELING FOR HER MORE THAN HE REALLY DOES."

HARRIET SEEMED READY TO WORSHIP HER FRIEND FOR A SENTENCE SO
SATISFACTORY; AND EMMA WAS ONLY SAVED FROM RAPTURES AND FONDNESS, WHICH
AT THAT MOMENT WOULD HAVE BEEN DREADFUL PENANCE, BY THE SOUND OF HER
FATHER'S FOOTSTEPS. HE WAS COMING THROUGH THE HALL. HARRIET WAS TOO
MUCH AGITATED TO ENCOUNTER HIM. "SHE COULD NOT COMPOSE HERSELF--
MR. WOODHOUSE WOULD BE ALARMED--SHE HAD BETTER GO;"--WITH MOST READY
ENCOURAGEMENT FROM HER FRIEND, THEREFORE, SHE PASSED OFF THROUGH ANOTHER
DOOR--AND THE MOMENT SHE WAS GONE, THIS WAS THE SPONTANEOUS BURST OF
EMMA'S FEELINGS: "OH GOD! THAT I HAD NEVER SEEN HER!"

THE REST OF THE DAY, THE FOLLOWING NIGHT, WERE HARDLY ENOUGH FOR HER
THOUGHTS.--SHE WAS BEWILDERED AMIDST THE CONFUSION OF ALL THAT HAD
RUSHED ON HER WITHIN THE LAST FEW HOURS. EVERY MOMENT HAD BROUGHT A
FRESH SURPRIZE; AND EVERY SURPRIZE MUST BE MATTER OF HUMILIATION TO
HER.--HOW TO UNDERSTAND IT ALL! HOW TO UNDERSTAND THE DECEPTIONS SHE HAD
BEEN THUS PRACTISING ON HERSELF, AND LIVING UNDER!--THE BLUNDERS, THE
BLINDNESS OF HER OWN HEAD AND HEART!--SHE SAT STILL, SHE WALKED ABOUT,
SHE TRIED HER OWN ROOM, SHE TRIED THE SHRUBBERY--IN EVERY PLACE, EVERY
POSTURE, SHE PERCEIVED THAT SHE HAD ACTED MOST WEAKLY; THAT SHE HAD
BEEN IMPOSED ON BY OTHERS IN A MOST MORTIFYING DEGREE; THAT SHE HAD
BEEN IMPOSING ON HERSELF IN A DEGREE YET MORE MORTIFYING; THAT SHE
WAS WRETCHED, AND SHOULD PROBABLY FIND THIS DAY BUT THE BEGINNING OF
WRETCHEDNESS.

TO UNDERSTAND, THOROUGHLY UNDERSTAND HER OWN HEART, WAS THE FIRST
ENDEAVOUR. TO THAT POINT WENT EVERY LEISURE MOMENT WHICH HER FATHER'S
CLAIMS ON HER ALLOWED, AND EVERY MOMENT OF INVOLUNTARY ABSENCE OF MIND.

HOW LONG HAD MR. KNIGHTLEY BEEN SO DEAR TO HER, AS EVERY FEELING
DECLARED HIM NOW TO BE? WHEN HAD HIS INFLUENCE, SUCH INFLUENCE BEGUN?--
WHEN HAD HE SUCCEEDED TO THAT PLACE IN HER AFFECTION, WHICH FRANK
CHURCHILL HAD ONCE, FOR A SHORT PERIOD, OCCUPIED?--SHE LOOKED BACK;
SHE COMPARED THE TWO--COMPARED THEM, AS THEY HAD ALWAYS STOOD IN HER
ESTIMATION, FROM THE TIME OF THE LATTER'S BECOMING KNOWN TO HER--AND AS
THEY MUST AT ANY TIME HAVE BEEN COMPARED BY HER, HAD IT--OH! HAD IT, BY
ANY BLESSED FELICITY, OCCURRED TO HER, TO INSTITUTE THE COMPARISON.--SHE
SAW THAT THERE NEVER HAD BEEN A TIME WHEN SHE DID NOT CONSIDER MR.
KNIGHTLEY AS INFINITELY THE SUPERIOR, OR WHEN HIS REGARD FOR HER HAD NOT
BEEN INFINITELY THE MOST DEAR. SHE SAW, THAT IN PERSUADING HERSELF,
IN FANCYING, IN ACTING TO THE CONTRARY, SHE HAD BEEN ENTIRELY UNDER A
DELUSION, TOTALLY IGNORANT OF HER OWN HEART--AND, IN SHORT, THAT SHE HAD
NEVER REALLY CARED FOR FRANK CHURCHILL AT ALL!

THIS WAS THE CONCLUSION OF THE FIRST SERIES OF REFLECTION. THIS WAS
THE KNOWLEDGE OF HERSELF, ON THE FIRST QUESTION OF INQUIRY, WHICH
SHE REACHED; AND WITHOUT BEING LONG IN REACHING IT.--SHE WAS MOST
SORROWFULLY INDIGNANT; ASHAMED OF EVERY SENSATION BUT THE ONE REVEALED
TO HER--HER AFFECTION FOR MR. KNIGHTLEY.--EVERY OTHER PART OF HER MIND
WAS DISGUSTING.

WITH INSUFFERABLE VANITY HAD SHE BELIEVED HERSELF IN THE SECRET OF EVERY
BODY'S FEELINGS; WITH UNPARDONABLE ARROGANCE PROPOSED TO ARRANGE EVERY
BODY'S DESTINY. SHE WAS PROVED TO HAVE BEEN UNIVERSALLY MISTAKEN; AND
SHE HAD NOT QUITE DONE NOTHING--FOR SHE HAD DONE MISCHIEF. SHE HAD
BROUGHT EVIL ON HARRIET, ON HERSELF, AND SHE TOO MUCH FEARED, ON MR.
KNIGHTLEY.--WERE THIS MOST UNEQUAL OF ALL CONNEXIONS TO TAKE PLACE, ON
HER MUST REST ALL THE REPROACH OF HAVING GIVEN IT A BEGINNING; FOR HIS
ATTACHMENT, SHE MUST BELIEVE TO BE PRODUCED ONLY BY A CONSCIOUSNESS OF
HARRIET'S;--AND EVEN WERE THIS NOT THE CASE, HE WOULD NEVER HAVE KNOWN
HARRIET AT ALL BUT FOR HER FOLLY.

MR. KNIGHTLEY AND HARRIET SMITH!--IT WAS A UNION TO DISTANCE EVERY
WONDER OF THE KIND.--THE ATTACHMENT OF FRANK CHURCHILL AND JANE FAIRFAX
BECAME COMMONPLACE, THREADBARE, STALE IN THE COMPARISON, EXCITING NO
SURPRIZE, PRESENTING NO DISPARITY, AFFORDING NOTHING TO BE SAID OR
THOUGHT.--MR. KNIGHTLEY AND HARRIET SMITH!--SUCH AN ELEVATION ON HER
SIDE! SUCH A DEBASEMENT ON HIS! IT WAS HORRIBLE TO EMMA TO THINK HOW IT
MUST SINK HIM IN THE GENERAL OPINION, TO FORESEE THE SMILES, THE SNEERS,
THE MERRIMENT IT WOULD PROMPT AT HIS EXPENSE; THE MORTIFICATION AND
DISDAIN OF HIS BROTHER, THE THOUSAND INCONVENIENCES TO HIMSELF.--COULD
IT BE?--NO; IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE. AND YET IT WAS FAR, VERY FAR, FROM
IMPOSSIBLE.--WAS IT A NEW CIRCUMSTANCE FOR A MAN OF FIRST-RATE ABILITIES
TO BE CAPTIVATED BY VERY INFERIOR POWERS? WAS IT NEW FOR ONE, PERHAPS
TOO BUSY TO SEEK, TO BE THE PRIZE OF A GIRL WHO WOULD SEEK HIM?--WAS
IT NEW FOR ANY THING IN THIS WORLD TO BE UNEQUAL, INCONSISTENT,
INCONGRUOUS--OR FOR CHANCE AND CIRCUMSTANCE (AS SECOND CAUSES) TO DIRECT
THE HUMAN FATE?

OH! HAD SHE NEVER BROUGHT HARRIET FORWARD! HAD SHE LEFT HER WHERE SHE
OUGHT, AND WHERE HE HAD TOLD HER SHE OUGHT!--HAD SHE NOT, WITH A
FOLLY WHICH NO TONGUE COULD EXPRESS, PREVENTED HER MARRYING THE
UNEXCEPTIONABLE YOUNG MAN WHO WOULD HAVE MADE HER HAPPY AND RESPECTABLE
IN THE LINE OF LIFE TO WHICH SHE OUGHT TO BELONG--ALL WOULD HAVE BEEN
SAFE; NONE OF THIS DREADFUL SEQUEL WOULD HAVE BEEN.

HOW HARRIET COULD EVER HAVE HAD THE PRESUMPTION TO RAISE HER THOUGHTS TO
MR. KNIGHTLEY!--HOW SHE COULD DARE TO FANCY HERSELF THE CHOSEN OF SUCH
A MAN TILL ACTUALLY ASSURED OF IT!--BUT HARRIET WAS LESS HUMBLE, HAD
FEWER SCRUPLES THAN FORMERLY.--HER INFERIORITY, WHETHER OF MIND OR
SITUATION, SEEMED LITTLE FELT.--SHE HAD SEEMED MORE SENSIBLE OF MR.
ELTON'S BEING TO STOOP IN MARRYING HER, THAN SHE NOW SEEMED OF MR.
KNIGHTLEY'S.--ALAS! WAS NOT THAT HER OWN DOING TOO? WHO HAD BEEN AT
PAINS TO GIVE HARRIET NOTIONS OF SELF-CONSEQUENCE BUT HERSELF?--WHO BUT
HERSELF HAD TAUGHT HER, THAT SHE WAS TO ELEVATE HERSELF IF POSSIBLE,
AND THAT HER CLAIMS WERE GREAT TO A HIGH WORLDLY ESTABLISHMENT?--IF
HARRIET, FROM BEING HUMBLE, WERE GROWN VAIN, IT WAS HER DOING TOO.



CHAPTER XII


TILL NOW THAT SHE WAS THREATENED WITH ITS LOSS, EMMA HAD NEVER KNOWN
HOW MUCH OF HER HAPPINESS DEPENDED ON BEING FIRST WITH MR. KNIGHTLEY,
FIRST IN INTEREST AND AFFECTION.--SATISFIED THAT IT WAS SO, AND FEELING
IT HER DUE, SHE HAD ENJOYED IT WITHOUT REFLECTION; AND ONLY IN THE
DREAD OF BEING SUPPLANTED, FOUND HOW INEXPRESSIBLY IMPORTANT IT HAD
BEEN.--LONG, VERY LONG, SHE FELT SHE HAD BEEN FIRST; FOR, HAVING NO
FEMALE CONNEXIONS OF HIS OWN, THERE HAD BEEN ONLY ISABELLA WHOSE CLAIMS
COULD BE COMPARED WITH HERS, AND SHE HAD ALWAYS KNOWN EXACTLY HOW FAR
HE LOVED AND ESTEEMED ISABELLA. SHE HAD HERSELF BEEN FIRST WITH HIM FOR
MANY YEARS PAST. SHE HAD NOT DESERVED IT; SHE HAD OFTEN BEEN NEGLIGENT
OR PERVERSE, SLIGHTING HIS ADVICE, OR EVEN WILFULLY OPPOSING HIM,
INSENSIBLE OF HALF HIS MERITS, AND QUARRELLING WITH HIM BECAUSE HE WOULD
NOT ACKNOWLEDGE HER FALSE AND INSOLENT ESTIMATE OF HER OWN--BUT STILL,
FROM FAMILY ATTACHMENT AND HABIT, AND THOROUGH EXCELLENCE OF MIND, HE
HAD LOVED HER, AND WATCHED OVER HER FROM A GIRL, WITH AN ENDEAVOUR TO
IMPROVE HER, AND AN ANXIETY FOR HER DOING RIGHT, WHICH NO OTHER CREATURE
HAD AT ALL SHARED. IN SPITE OF ALL HER FAULTS, SHE KNEW SHE WAS DEAR
TO HIM; MIGHT SHE NOT SAY, VERY DEAR?--WHEN THE SUGGESTIONS OF HOPE,
HOWEVER, WHICH MUST FOLLOW HERE, PRESENTED THEMSELVES, SHE COULD NOT
PRESUME TO INDULGE THEM. HARRIET SMITH MIGHT THINK HERSELF NOT UNWORTHY
OF BEING PECULIARLY, EXCLUSIVELY, PASSIONATELY LOVED BY MR. KNIGHTLEY.
SHE COULD NOT. SHE COULD NOT FLATTER HERSELF WITH ANY IDEA OF
BLINDNESS IN HIS ATTACHMENT TO HER. SHE HAD RECEIVED A VERY RECENT
PROOF OF ITS IMPARTIALITY.--HOW SHOCKED HAD HE BEEN BY HER BEHAVIOUR TO
MISS BATES! HOW DIRECTLY, HOW STRONGLY HAD HE EXPRESSED HIMSELF TO HER
ON THE SUBJECT!--NOT TOO STRONGLY FOR THE OFFENCE--BUT FAR, FAR TOO
STRONGLY TO ISSUE FROM ANY FEELING SOFTER THAN UPRIGHT JUSTICE AND
CLEAR-SIGHTED GOODWILL.--SHE HAD NO HOPE, NOTHING TO DESERVE THE NAME
OF HOPE, THAT HE COULD HAVE THAT SORT OF AFFECTION FOR HERSELF WHICH WAS
NOW IN QUESTION; BUT THERE WAS A HOPE (AT TIMES A SLIGHT ONE, AT
TIMES MUCH STRONGER,) THAT HARRIET MIGHT HAVE DECEIVED HERSELF, AND BE
OVERRATING HIS REGARD FOR HER.--WISH IT SHE MUST, FOR HIS SAKE--BE THE
CONSEQUENCE NOTHING TO HERSELF, BUT HIS REMAINING SINGLE ALL HIS LIFE.
COULD SHE BE SECURE OF THAT, INDEED, OF HIS NEVER MARRYING AT ALL, SHE
BELIEVED SHE SHOULD BE PERFECTLY SATISFIED.--LET HIM BUT CONTINUE THE
SAME MR. KNIGHTLEY TO HER AND HER FATHER, THE SAME MR. KNIGHTLEY TO
ALL THE WORLD; LET DONWELL AND HARTFIELD LOSE NONE OF THEIR PRECIOUS
INTERCOURSE OF FRIENDSHIP AND CONFIDENCE, AND HER PEACE WOULD BE
FULLY SECURED.--MARRIAGE, IN FACT, WOULD NOT DO FOR HER. IT WOULD BE
INCOMPATIBLE WITH WHAT SHE OWED TO HER FATHER, AND WITH WHAT SHE FELT
FOR HIM. NOTHING SHOULD SEPARATE HER FROM HER FATHER. SHE WOULD NOT
MARRY, EVEN IF SHE WERE ASKED BY MR. KNIGHTLEY.

IT MUST BE HER ARDENT WISH THAT HARRIET MIGHT BE DISAPPOINTED; AND SHE
HOPED, THAT WHEN ABLE TO SEE THEM TOGETHER AGAIN, SHE MIGHT AT LEAST
BE ABLE TO ASCERTAIN WHAT THE CHANCES FOR IT WERE.--SHE SHOULD SEE THEM
HENCEFORWARD WITH THE CLOSEST OBSERVANCE; AND WRETCHEDLY AS SHE HAD
HITHERTO MISUNDERSTOOD EVEN THOSE SHE WAS WATCHING, SHE DID NOT KNOW HOW
TO ADMIT THAT SHE COULD BE BLINDED HERE.--HE WAS EXPECTED BACK EVERY
DAY. THE POWER OF OBSERVATION WOULD BE SOON GIVEN--FRIGHTFULLY SOON IT
APPEARED WHEN HER THOUGHTS WERE IN ONE COURSE. IN THE MEANWHILE, SHE
RESOLVED AGAINST SEEING HARRIET.--IT WOULD DO NEITHER OF THEM GOOD,
IT WOULD DO THE SUBJECT NO GOOD, TO BE TALKING OF IT FARTHER.--SHE WAS
RESOLVED NOT TO BE CONVINCED, AS LONG AS SHE COULD DOUBT, AND YET HAD
NO AUTHORITY FOR OPPOSING HARRIET'S CONFIDENCE. TO TALK WOULD BE ONLY TO
IRRITATE.--SHE WROTE TO HER, THEREFORE, KINDLY, BUT DECISIVELY, TO BEG
THAT SHE WOULD NOT, AT PRESENT, COME TO HARTFIELD; ACKNOWLEDGING IT TO
BE HER CONVICTION, THAT ALL FARTHER CONFIDENTIAL DISCUSSION OF ONE
TOPIC HAD BETTER BE AVOIDED; AND HOPING, THAT IF A FEW DAYS WERE ALLOWED
TO PASS BEFORE THEY MET AGAIN, EXCEPT IN THE COMPANY OF OTHERS--SHE
OBJECTED ONLY TO A TETE-A-TETE--THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO ACT AS IF THEY
HAD FORGOTTEN THE CONVERSATION OF YESTERDAY.--HARRIET SUBMITTED, AND
APPROVED, AND WAS GRATEFUL.

THIS POINT WAS JUST ARRANGED, WHEN A VISITOR ARRIVED TO TEAR EMMA'S
THOUGHTS A LITTLE FROM THE ONE SUBJECT WHICH HAD ENGROSSED THEM,
SLEEPING OR WAKING, THE LAST TWENTY-FOUR HOURS--MRS. WESTON, WHO HAD
BEEN CALLING ON HER DAUGHTER-IN-LAW ELECT, AND TOOK HARTFIELD IN HER
WAY HOME, ALMOST AS MUCH IN DUTY TO EMMA AS IN PLEASURE TO HERSELF, TO
RELATE ALL THE PARTICULARS OF SO INTERESTING AN INTERVIEW.

MR. WESTON HAD ACCOMPANIED HER TO MRS. BATES'S, AND GONE THROUGH HIS
SHARE OF THIS ESSENTIAL ATTENTION MOST HANDSOMELY; BUT SHE HAVING THEN
INDUCED MISS FAIRFAX TO JOIN HER IN AN AIRING, WAS NOW RETURNED WITH
MUCH MORE TO SAY, AND MUCH MORE TO SAY WITH SATISFACTION, THAN A QUARTER
OF AN HOUR SPENT IN MRS. BATES'S PARLOUR, WITH ALL THE ENCUMBRANCE OF
AWKWARD FEELINGS, COULD HAVE AFFORDED.

A LITTLE CURIOSITY EMMA HAD; AND SHE MADE THE MOST OF IT WHILE HER
FRIEND RELATED. MRS. WESTON HAD SET OFF TO PAY THE VISIT IN A GOOD DEAL
OF AGITATION HERSELF; AND IN THE FIRST PLACE HAD WISHED NOT TO GO AT ALL
AT PRESENT, TO BE ALLOWED MERELY TO WRITE TO MISS FAIRFAX INSTEAD, AND
TO DEFER THIS CEREMONIOUS CALL TILL A LITTLE TIME HAD PASSED, AND MR.
CHURCHILL COULD BE RECONCILED TO THE ENGAGEMENT'S BECOMING KNOWN; AS,
CONSIDERING EVERY THING, SHE THOUGHT SUCH A VISIT COULD NOT BE PAID
WITHOUT LEADING TO REPORTS:--BUT MR. WESTON HAD THOUGHT DIFFERENTLY; HE
WAS EXTREMELY ANXIOUS TO SHEW HIS APPROBATION TO MISS FAIRFAX AND HER
FAMILY, AND DID NOT CONCEIVE THAT ANY SUSPICION COULD BE EXCITED BY IT;
OR IF IT WERE, THAT IT WOULD BE OF ANY CONSEQUENCE; FOR "SUCH THINGS,"
HE OBSERVED, "ALWAYS GOT ABOUT." EMMA SMILED, AND FELT THAT MR. WESTON
HAD VERY GOOD REASON FOR SAYING SO. THEY HAD GONE, IN SHORT--AND VERY
GREAT HAD BEEN THE EVIDENT DISTRESS AND CONFUSION OF THE LADY. SHE HAD
HARDLY BEEN ABLE TO SPEAK A WORD, AND EVERY LOOK AND ACTION HAD SHEWN
HOW DEEPLY SHE WAS SUFFERING FROM CONSCIOUSNESS. THE QUIET, HEART-FELT
SATISFACTION OF THE OLD LADY, AND THE RAPTUROUS DELIGHT OF HER
DAUGHTER--WHO PROVED EVEN TOO JOYOUS TO TALK AS USUAL, HAD BEEN A
GRATIFYING, YET ALMOST AN AFFECTING, SCENE. THEY WERE BOTH SO TRULY
RESPECTABLE IN THEIR HAPPINESS, SO DISINTERESTED IN EVERY SENSATION;
THOUGHT SO MUCH OF JANE; SO MUCH OF EVERY BODY, AND SO LITTLE OF
THEMSELVES, THAT EVERY KINDLY FEELING WAS AT WORK FOR THEM. MISS
FAIRFAX'S RECENT ILLNESS HAD OFFERED A FAIR PLEA FOR MRS. WESTON TO
INVITE HER TO AN AIRING; SHE HAD DRAWN BACK AND DECLINED AT FIRST, BUT,
ON BEING PRESSED HAD YIELDED; AND, IN THE COURSE OF THEIR DRIVE,
MRS. WESTON HAD, BY GENTLE ENCOURAGEMENT, OVERCOME SO MUCH OF HER
EMBARRASSMENT, AS TO BRING HER TO CONVERSE ON THE IMPORTANT SUBJECT.
APOLOGIES FOR HER SEEMINGLY UNGRACIOUS SILENCE IN THEIR FIRST RECEPTION,
AND THE WARMEST EXPRESSIONS OF THE GRATITUDE SHE WAS ALWAYS FEELING
TOWARDS HERSELF AND MR. WESTON, MUST NECESSARILY OPEN THE CAUSE; BUT
WHEN THESE EFFUSIONS WERE PUT BY, THEY HAD TALKED A GOOD DEAL OF THE
PRESENT AND OF THE FUTURE STATE OF THE ENGAGEMENT. MRS. WESTON WAS
CONVINCED THAT SUCH CONVERSATION MUST BE THE GREATEST RELIEF TO HER
COMPANION, PENT UP WITHIN HER OWN MIND AS EVERY THING HAD SO LONG BEEN,
AND WAS VERY MUCH PLEASED WITH ALL THAT SHE HAD SAID ON THE SUBJECT.

"ON THE MISERY OF WHAT SHE HAD SUFFERED, DURING THE CONCEALMENT OF SO
MANY MONTHS," CONTINUED MRS. WESTON, "SHE WAS ENERGETIC. THIS WAS ONE
OF HER EXPRESSIONS. 'I WILL NOT SAY, THAT SINCE I ENTERED INTO THE
ENGAGEMENT I HAVE NOT HAD SOME HAPPY MOMENTS; BUT I CAN SAY, THAT I HAVE
NEVER KNOWN THE BLESSING OF ONE TRANQUIL HOUR:'--AND THE QUIVERING LIP,
EMMA, WHICH UTTERED IT, WAS AN ATTESTATION THAT I FELT AT MY HEART."

"POOR GIRL!" SAID EMMA. "SHE THINKS HERSELF WRONG, THEN, FOR HAVING
CONSENTED TO A PRIVATE ENGAGEMENT?"

"WRONG! NO ONE, I BELIEVE, CAN BLAME HER MORE THAN SHE IS DISPOSED
TO BLAME HERSELF. 'THE CONSEQUENCE,' SAID SHE, 'HAS BEEN A STATE OF
PERPETUAL SUFFERING TO ME; AND SO IT OUGHT. BUT AFTER ALL THE PUNISHMENT
THAT MISCONDUCT CAN BRING, IT IS STILL NOT LESS MISCONDUCT. PAIN IS NO
EXPIATION. I NEVER CAN BE BLAMELESS. I HAVE BEEN ACTING CONTRARY TO ALL
MY SENSE OF RIGHT; AND THE FORTUNATE TURN THAT EVERY THING HAS TAKEN,
AND THE KINDNESS I AM NOW RECEIVING, IS WHAT MY CONSCIENCE TELLS ME
OUGHT NOT TO BE.' 'DO NOT IMAGINE, MADAM,' SHE CONTINUED, 'THAT I WAS
TAUGHT WRONG. DO NOT LET ANY REFLECTION FALL ON THE PRINCIPLES OR THE
CARE OF THE FRIENDS WHO BROUGHT ME UP. THE ERROR HAS BEEN ALL MY OWN;
AND I DO ASSURE YOU THAT, WITH ALL THE EXCUSE THAT PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES
MAY APPEAR TO GIVE, I SHALL YET DREAD MAKING THE STORY KNOWN TO COLONEL
CAMPBELL.'"

"POOR GIRL!" SAID EMMA AGAIN. "SHE LOVES HIM THEN EXCESSIVELY, I
SUPPOSE. IT MUST HAVE BEEN FROM ATTACHMENT ONLY, THAT SHE COULD BE
LED TO FORM THE ENGAGEMENT. HER AFFECTION MUST HAVE OVERPOWERED HER
JUDGMENT."

"YES, I HAVE NO DOUBT OF HER BEING EXTREMELY ATTACHED TO HIM."

"I AM AFRAID," RETURNED EMMA, SIGHING, "THAT I MUST OFTEN HAVE
CONTRIBUTED TO MAKE HER UNHAPPY."

"ON YOUR SIDE, MY LOVE, IT WAS VERY INNOCENTLY DONE. BUT SHE
PROBABLY HAD SOMETHING OF THAT IN HER THOUGHTS, WHEN ALLUDING TO THE
MISUNDERSTANDINGS WHICH HE HAD GIVEN US HINTS OF BEFORE. ONE NATURAL
CONSEQUENCE OF THE EVIL SHE HAD INVOLVED HERSELF IN," SHE SAID, "WAS
THAT OF MAKING HER UNREASONABLE. THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF HAVING DONE
AMISS, HAD EXPOSED HER TO A THOUSAND INQUIETUDES, AND MADE HER CAPTIOUS
AND IRRITABLE TO A DEGREE THAT MUST HAVE BEEN--THAT HAD BEEN--HARD FOR
HIM TO BEAR. 'I DID NOT MAKE THE ALLOWANCES,' SAID SHE, 'WHICH I OUGHT
TO HAVE DONE, FOR HIS TEMPER AND SPIRITS--HIS DELIGHTFUL SPIRITS, AND
THAT GAIETY, THAT PLAYFULNESS OF DISPOSITION, WHICH, UNDER ANY OTHER
CIRCUMSTANCES, WOULD, I AM SURE, HAVE BEEN AS CONSTANTLY BEWITCHING TO
ME, AS THEY WERE AT FIRST.' SHE THEN BEGAN TO SPEAK OF YOU, AND OF THE
GREAT KINDNESS YOU HAD SHEWN HER DURING HER ILLNESS; AND WITH A BLUSH
WHICH SHEWED ME HOW IT WAS ALL CONNECTED, DESIRED ME, WHENEVER I HAD
AN OPPORTUNITY, TO THANK YOU--I COULD NOT THANK YOU TOO MUCH--FOR EVERY
WISH AND EVERY ENDEAVOUR TO DO HER GOOD. SHE WAS SENSIBLE THAT YOU HAD
NEVER RECEIVED ANY PROPER ACKNOWLEDGMENT FROM HERSELF."

"IF I DID NOT KNOW HER TO BE HAPPY NOW," SAID EMMA, SERIOUSLY, "WHICH,
IN SPITE OF EVERY LITTLE DRAWBACK FROM HER SCRUPULOUS CONSCIENCE, SHE
MUST BE, I COULD NOT BEAR THESE THANKS;--FOR, OH! MRS. WESTON, IF THERE
WERE AN ACCOUNT DRAWN UP OF THE EVIL AND THE GOOD I HAVE DONE MISS
FAIRFAX!--WELL (CHECKING HERSELF, AND TRYING TO BE MORE LIVELY), THIS
IS ALL TO BE FORGOTTEN. YOU ARE VERY KIND TO BRING ME THESE INTERESTING
PARTICULARS. THEY SHEW HER TO THE GREATEST ADVANTAGE. I AM SURE SHE IS
VERY GOOD--I HOPE SHE WILL BE VERY HAPPY. IT IS FIT THAT THE FORTUNE
SHOULD BE ON HIS SIDE, FOR I THINK THE MERIT WILL BE ALL ON HERS."

SUCH A CONCLUSION COULD NOT PASS UNANSWERED BY MRS. WESTON. SHE THOUGHT
WELL OF FRANK IN ALMOST EVERY RESPECT; AND, WHAT WAS MORE, SHE LOVED HIM
VERY MUCH, AND HER DEFENCE WAS, THEREFORE, EARNEST. SHE TALKED WITH A
GREAT DEAL OF REASON, AND AT LEAST EQUAL AFFECTION--BUT SHE HAD TOO MUCH
TO URGE FOR EMMA'S ATTENTION; IT WAS SOON GONE TO BRUNSWICK SQUARE OR
TO DONWELL; SHE FORGOT TO ATTEMPT TO LISTEN; AND WHEN MRS. WESTON ENDED
WITH, "WE HAVE NOT YET HAD THE LETTER WE ARE SO ANXIOUS FOR, YOU KNOW,
BUT I HOPE IT WILL SOON COME," SHE WAS OBLIGED TO PAUSE BEFORE SHE
ANSWERED, AND AT LAST OBLIGED TO ANSWER AT RANDOM, BEFORE SHE COULD AT
ALL RECOLLECT WHAT LETTER IT WAS WHICH THEY WERE SO ANXIOUS FOR.

"ARE YOU WELL, MY EMMA?" WAS MRS. WESTON'S PARTING QUESTION.

"OH! PERFECTLY. I AM ALWAYS WELL, YOU KNOW. BE SURE TO GIVE ME
INTELLIGENCE OF THE LETTER AS SOON AS POSSIBLE."

MRS. WESTON'S COMMUNICATIONS FURNISHED EMMA WITH MORE FOOD FOR
UNPLEASANT REFLECTION, BY INCREASING HER ESTEEM AND COMPASSION, AND HER
SENSE OF PAST INJUSTICE TOWARDS MISS FAIRFAX. SHE BITTERLY REGRETTED
NOT HAVING SOUGHT A CLOSER ACQUAINTANCE WITH HER, AND BLUSHED FOR THE
ENVIOUS FEELINGS WHICH HAD CERTAINLY BEEN, IN SOME MEASURE, THE CAUSE.
HAD SHE FOLLOWED MR. KNIGHTLEY'S KNOWN WISHES, IN PAYING THAT ATTENTION
TO MISS FAIRFAX, WHICH WAS EVERY WAY HER DUE; HAD SHE TRIED TO KNOW HER
BETTER; HAD SHE DONE HER PART TOWARDS INTIMACY; HAD SHE ENDEAVOURED
TO FIND A FRIEND THERE INSTEAD OF IN HARRIET SMITH; SHE MUST, IN ALL
PROBABILITY, HAVE BEEN SPARED FROM EVERY PAIN WHICH PRESSED ON HER
NOW.--BIRTH, ABILITIES, AND EDUCATION, HAD BEEN EQUALLY MARKING ONE AS
AN ASSOCIATE FOR HER, TO BE RECEIVED WITH GRATITUDE; AND THE OTHER--WHAT
WAS SHE?--SUPPOSING EVEN THAT THEY HAD NEVER BECOME INTIMATE FRIENDS;
THAT SHE HAD NEVER BEEN ADMITTED INTO MISS FAIRFAX'S CONFIDENCE ON THIS
IMPORTANT MATTER--WHICH WAS MOST PROBABLE--STILL, IN KNOWING HER AS
SHE OUGHT, AND AS SHE MIGHT, SHE MUST HAVE BEEN PRESERVED FROM THE
ABOMINABLE SUSPICIONS OF AN IMPROPER ATTACHMENT TO MR. DIXON, WHICH SHE
HAD NOT ONLY SO FOOLISHLY FASHIONED AND HARBOURED HERSELF, BUT HAD SO
UNPARDONABLY IMPARTED; AN IDEA WHICH SHE GREATLY FEARED HAD BEEN MADE A
SUBJECT OF MATERIAL DISTRESS TO THE DELICACY OF JANE'S FEELINGS, BY THE
LEVITY OR CARELESSNESS OF FRANK CHURCHILL'S. OF ALL THE SOURCES OF EVIL
SURROUNDING THE FORMER, SINCE HER COMING TO HIGHBURY, SHE WAS PERSUADED
THAT SHE MUST HERSELF HAVE BEEN THE WORST. SHE MUST HAVE BEEN A
PERPETUAL ENEMY. THEY NEVER COULD HAVE BEEN ALL THREE TOGETHER, WITHOUT
HER HAVING STABBED JANE FAIRFAX'S PEACE IN A THOUSAND INSTANCES; AND ON
BOX HILL, PERHAPS, IT HAD BEEN THE AGONY OF A MIND THAT WOULD BEAR NO
MORE.

THE EVENING OF THIS DAY WAS VERY LONG, AND MELANCHOLY, AT HARTFIELD.
THE WEATHER ADDED WHAT IT COULD OF GLOOM. A COLD STORMY RAIN SET IN, AND
NOTHING OF JULY APPEARED BUT IN THE TREES AND SHRUBS, WHICH THE WIND WAS
DESPOILING, AND THE LENGTH OF THE DAY, WHICH ONLY MADE SUCH CRUEL SIGHTS
THE LONGER VISIBLE.

THE WEATHER AFFECTED MR. WOODHOUSE, AND HE COULD ONLY BE KEPT TOLERABLY
COMFORTABLE BY ALMOST CEASELESS ATTENTION ON HIS DAUGHTER'S SIDE, AND BY
EXERTIONS WHICH HAD NEVER COST HER HALF SO MUCH BEFORE. IT REMINDED
HER OF THEIR FIRST FORLORN TETE-A-TETE, ON THE EVENING OF MRS. WESTON'S
WEDDING-DAY; BUT MR. KNIGHTLEY HAD WALKED IN THEN, SOON AFTER TEA,
AND DISSIPATED EVERY MELANCHOLY FANCY. ALAS! SUCH DELIGHTFUL PROOFS OF
HARTFIELD'S ATTRACTION, AS THOSE SORT OF VISITS CONVEYED, MIGHT SHORTLY
BE OVER. THE PICTURE WHICH SHE HAD THEN DRAWN OF THE PRIVATIONS OF THE
APPROACHING WINTER, HAD PROVED ERRONEOUS; NO FRIENDS HAD DESERTED THEM,
NO PLEASURES HAD BEEN LOST.--BUT HER PRESENT FOREBODINGS SHE FEARED
WOULD EXPERIENCE NO SIMILAR CONTRADICTION. THE PROSPECT BEFORE HER NOW,
WAS THREATENING TO A DEGREE THAT COULD NOT BE ENTIRELY DISPELLED--THAT
MIGHT NOT BE EVEN PARTIALLY BRIGHTENED. IF ALL TOOK PLACE THAT
MIGHT TAKE PLACE AMONG THE CIRCLE OF HER FRIENDS, HARTFIELD MUST BE
COMPARATIVELY DESERTED; AND SHE LEFT TO CHEER HER FATHER WITH THE
SPIRITS ONLY OF RUINED HAPPINESS.

THE CHILD TO BE BORN AT RANDALLS MUST BE A TIE THERE EVEN DEARER THAN
HERSELF; AND MRS. WESTON'S HEART AND TIME WOULD BE OCCUPIED BY IT.
THEY SHOULD LOSE HER; AND, PROBABLY, IN GREAT MEASURE, HER HUSBAND
ALSO.--FRANK CHURCHILL WOULD RETURN AMONG THEM NO MORE; AND MISS
FAIRFAX, IT WAS REASONABLE TO SUPPOSE, WOULD SOON CEASE TO BELONG TO
HIGHBURY. THEY WOULD BE MARRIED, AND SETTLED EITHER AT OR NEAR ENSCOMBE.
ALL THAT WERE GOOD WOULD BE WITHDRAWN; AND IF TO THESE LOSSES, THE
LOSS OF DONWELL WERE TO BE ADDED, WHAT WOULD REMAIN OF CHEERFUL OR
OF RATIONAL SOCIETY WITHIN THEIR REACH? MR. KNIGHTLEY TO BE NO LONGER
COMING THERE FOR HIS EVENING COMFORT!--NO LONGER WALKING IN AT ALL
HOURS, AS IF EVER WILLING TO CHANGE HIS OWN HOME FOR THEIR'S!--HOW WAS
IT TO BE ENDURED? AND IF HE WERE TO BE LOST TO THEM FOR HARRIET'S SAKE;
IF HE WERE TO BE THOUGHT OF HEREAFTER, AS FINDING IN HARRIET'S SOCIETY
ALL THAT HE WANTED; IF HARRIET WERE TO BE THE CHOSEN, THE FIRST,
THE DEAREST, THE FRIEND, THE WIFE TO WHOM HE LOOKED FOR ALL THE BEST
BLESSINGS OF EXISTENCE; WHAT COULD BE INCREASING EMMA'S WRETCHEDNESS BUT
THE REFLECTION NEVER FAR DISTANT FROM HER MIND, THAT IT HAD BEEN ALL HER
OWN WORK?

WHEN IT CAME TO SUCH A PITCH AS THIS, SHE WAS NOT ABLE TO REFRAIN FROM
A START, OR A HEAVY SIGH, OR EVEN FROM WALKING ABOUT THE ROOM FOR A
FEW SECONDS--AND THE ONLY SOURCE WHENCE ANY THING LIKE CONSOLATION
OR COMPOSURE COULD BE DRAWN, WAS IN THE RESOLUTION OF HER OWN BETTER
CONDUCT, AND THE HOPE THAT, HOWEVER INFERIOR IN SPIRIT AND GAIETY MIGHT
BE THE FOLLOWING AND EVERY FUTURE WINTER OF HER LIFE TO THE PAST, IT
WOULD YET FIND HER MORE RATIONAL, MORE ACQUAINTED WITH HERSELF, AND
LEAVE HER LESS TO REGRET WHEN IT WERE GONE.



CHAPTER XIII


THE WEATHER CONTINUED MUCH THE SAME ALL THE FOLLOWING MORNING; AND
THE SAME LONELINESS, AND THE SAME MELANCHOLY, SEEMED TO REIGN AT
HARTFIELD--BUT IN THE AFTERNOON IT CLEARED; THE WIND CHANGED INTO A
SOFTER QUARTER; THE CLOUDS WERE CARRIED OFF; THE SUN APPEARED; IT WAS
SUMMER AGAIN. WITH ALL THE EAGERNESS WHICH SUCH A TRANSITION GIVES, EMMA
RESOLVED TO BE OUT OF DOORS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. NEVER HAD THE EXQUISITE
SIGHT, SMELL, SENSATION OF NATURE, TRANQUIL, WARM, AND BRILLIANT AFTER
A STORM, BEEN MORE ATTRACTIVE TO HER. SHE LONGED FOR THE SERENITY THEY
MIGHT GRADUALLY INTRODUCE; AND ON MR. PERRY'S COMING IN SOON AFTER
DINNER, WITH A DISENGAGED HOUR TO GIVE HER FATHER, SHE LOST NO TIME
ILL HURRYING INTO THE SHRUBBERY.--THERE, WITH SPIRITS FRESHENED, AND
THOUGHTS A LITTLE RELIEVED, SHE HAD TAKEN A FEW TURNS, WHEN SHE SAW MR.
KNIGHTLEY PASSING THROUGH THE GARDEN DOOR, AND COMING TOWARDS HER.--IT
WAS THE FIRST INTIMATION OF HIS BEING RETURNED FROM LONDON. SHE HAD
BEEN THINKING OF HIM THE MOMENT BEFORE, AS UNQUESTIONABLY SIXTEEN MILES
DISTANT.--THERE WAS TIME ONLY FOR THE QUICKEST ARRANGEMENT OF MIND. SHE
MUST BE COLLECTED AND CALM. IN HALF A MINUTE THEY WERE TOGETHER. THE
"HOW D'YE DO'S" WERE QUIET AND CONSTRAINED ON EACH SIDE. SHE ASKED AFTER
THEIR MUTUAL FRIENDS; THEY WERE ALL WELL.--WHEN HAD HE LEFT THEM?--ONLY
THAT MORNING. HE MUST HAVE HAD A WET RIDE.--YES.--HE MEANT TO WALK WITH
HER, SHE FOUND. "HE HAD JUST LOOKED INTO THE DINING-ROOM, AND AS HE WAS
NOT WANTED THERE, PREFERRED BEING OUT OF DOORS."--SHE THOUGHT HE NEITHER
LOOKED NOR SPOKE CHEERFULLY; AND THE FIRST POSSIBLE CAUSE FOR IT,
SUGGESTED BY HER FEARS, WAS, THAT HE HAD PERHAPS BEEN COMMUNICATING HIS
PLANS TO HIS BROTHER, AND WAS PAINED BY THE MANNER IN WHICH THEY HAD
BEEN RECEIVED.

THEY WALKED TOGETHER. HE WAS SILENT. SHE THOUGHT HE WAS OFTEN LOOKING
AT HER, AND TRYING FOR A FULLER VIEW OF HER FACE THAN IT SUITED HER TO
GIVE. AND THIS BELIEF PRODUCED ANOTHER DREAD. PERHAPS HE WANTED TO
SPEAK TO HER, OF HIS ATTACHMENT TO HARRIET; HE MIGHT BE WATCHING FOR
ENCOURAGEMENT TO BEGIN.--SHE DID NOT, COULD NOT, FEEL EQUAL TO LEAD THE
WAY TO ANY SUCH SUBJECT. HE MUST DO IT ALL HIMSELF. YET SHE COULD
NOT BEAR THIS SILENCE. WITH HIM IT WAS MOST UNNATURAL. SHE
CONSIDERED--RESOLVED--AND, TRYING TO SMILE, BEGAN--

"YOU HAVE SOME NEWS TO HEAR, NOW YOU ARE COME BACK, THAT WILL RATHER
SURPRIZE YOU."

"HAVE I?" SAID HE QUIETLY, AND LOOKING AT HER; "OF WHAT NATURE?"

"OH! THE BEST NATURE IN THE WORLD--A WEDDING."

AFTER WAITING A MOMENT, AS IF TO BE SURE SHE INTENDED TO SAY NO MORE, HE
REPLIED,

"IF YOU MEAN MISS FAIRFAX AND FRANK CHURCHILL, I HAVE HEARD THAT
ALREADY."

"HOW IS IT POSSIBLE?" CRIED EMMA, TURNING HER GLOWING CHEEKS TOWARDS
HIM; FOR, WHILE SHE SPOKE, IT OCCURRED TO HER THAT HE MIGHT HAVE CALLED
AT MRS. GODDARD'S IN HIS WAY.

"I HAD A FEW LINES ON PARISH BUSINESS FROM MR. WESTON THIS MORNING, AND
AT THE END OF THEM HE GAVE ME A BRIEF ACCOUNT OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED."

EMMA WAS QUITE RELIEVED, AND COULD PRESENTLY SAY, WITH A LITTLE MORE
COMPOSURE,

"YOU PROBABLY HAVE BEEN LESS SURPRIZED THAN ANY OF US, FOR YOU HAVE
HAD YOUR SUSPICIONS.--I HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN THAT YOU ONCE TRIED TO GIVE
ME A CAUTION.--I WISH I HAD ATTENDED TO IT--BUT--(WITH A SINKING VOICE
AND A HEAVY SIGH) I SEEM TO HAVE BEEN DOOMED TO BLINDNESS."

FOR A MOMENT OR TWO NOTHING WAS SAID, AND SHE WAS UNSUSPICIOUS OF HAVING
EXCITED ANY PARTICULAR INTEREST, TILL SHE FOUND HER ARM DRAWN WITHIN
HIS, AND PRESSED AGAINST HIS HEART, AND HEARD HIM THUS SAYING, IN A TONE
OF GREAT SENSIBILITY, SPEAKING LOW,

"TIME, MY DEAREST EMMA, TIME WILL HEAL THE WOUND.--YOUR OWN EXCELLENT
SENSE--YOUR EXERTIONS FOR YOUR FATHER'S SAKE--I KNOW YOU WILL NOT ALLOW
YOURSELF--." HER ARM WAS PRESSED AGAIN, AS HE ADDED, IN A MORE
BROKEN AND SUBDUED ACCENT, "THE FEELINGS OF THE WARMEST
FRIENDSHIP--INDIGNATION--ABOMINABLE SCOUNDREL!"--AND IN A LOUDER,
STEADIER TONE, HE CONCLUDED WITH, "HE WILL SOON BE GONE. THEY WILL SOON
BE IN YORKSHIRE. I AM SORRY FOR HER. SHE DESERVES A BETTER FATE."

EMMA UNDERSTOOD HIM; AND AS SOON AS SHE COULD RECOVER FROM THE FLUTTER
OF PLEASURE, EXCITED BY SUCH TENDER CONSIDERATION, REPLIED,

"YOU ARE VERY KIND--BUT YOU ARE MISTAKEN--AND I MUST SET YOU RIGHT.--
I AM NOT IN WANT OF THAT SORT OF COMPASSION. MY BLINDNESS TO WHAT WAS
GOING ON, LED ME TO ACT BY THEM IN A WAY THAT I MUST ALWAYS BE ASHAMED
OF, AND I WAS VERY FOOLISHLY TEMPTED TO SAY AND DO MANY THINGS WHICH MAY
WELL LAY ME OPEN TO UNPLEASANT CONJECTURES, BUT I HAVE NO OTHER REASON
TO REGRET THAT I WAS NOT IN THE SECRET EARLIER."

"EMMA!" CRIED HE, LOOKING EAGERLY AT HER, "ARE YOU, INDEED?"--BUT
CHECKING HIMSELF--"NO, NO, I UNDERSTAND YOU--FORGIVE ME--I AM PLEASED
THAT YOU CAN SAY EVEN SO MUCH.--HE IS NO OBJECT OF REGRET, INDEED! AND
IT WILL NOT BE VERY LONG, I HOPE, BEFORE THAT BECOMES THE ACKNOWLEDGMENT
OF MORE THAN YOUR REASON.--FORTUNATE THAT YOUR AFFECTIONS WERE NOT
FARTHER ENTANGLED!--I COULD NEVER, I CONFESS, FROM YOUR MANNERS, ASSURE
MYSELF AS TO THE DEGREE OF WHAT YOU FELT--I COULD ONLY BE CERTAIN THAT
THERE WAS A PREFERENCE--AND A PREFERENCE WHICH I NEVER BELIEVED HIM TO
DESERVE.--HE IS A DISGRACE TO THE NAME OF MAN.--AND IS HE TO BE REWARDED
WITH THAT SWEET YOUNG WOMAN?--JANE, JANE, YOU WILL BE A MISERABLE
CREATURE."

"MR. KNIGHTLEY," SAID EMMA, TRYING TO BE LIVELY, BUT REALLY CONFUSED--"I
AM IN A VERY EXTRAORDINARY SITUATION. I CANNOT LET YOU CONTINUE IN YOUR
ERROR; AND YET, PERHAPS, SINCE MY MANNERS GAVE SUCH AN IMPRESSION, I
HAVE AS MUCH REASON TO BE ASHAMED OF CONFESSING THAT I NEVER HAVE BEEN
AT ALL ATTACHED TO THE PERSON WE ARE SPEAKING OF, AS IT MIGHT BE NATURAL
FOR A WOMAN TO FEEL IN CONFESSING EXACTLY THE REVERSE.--BUT I NEVER
HAVE."

HE LISTENED IN PERFECT SILENCE. SHE WISHED HIM TO SPEAK, BUT HE WOULD
NOT. SHE SUPPOSED SHE MUST SAY MORE BEFORE SHE WERE ENTITLED TO HIS
CLEMENCY; BUT IT WAS A HARD CASE TO BE OBLIGED STILL TO LOWER HERSELF IN
HIS OPINION. SHE WENT ON, HOWEVER.

"I HAVE VERY LITTLE TO SAY FOR MY OWN CONDUCT.--I WAS TEMPTED BY HIS
ATTENTIONS, AND ALLOWED MYSELF TO APPEAR PLEASED.--AN OLD STORY,
PROBABLY--A COMMON CASE--AND NO MORE THAN HAS HAPPENED TO HUNDREDS OF MY
SEX BEFORE; AND YET IT MAY NOT BE THE MORE EXCUSABLE IN ONE WHO SETS UP
AS I DO FOR UNDERSTANDING. MANY CIRCUMSTANCES ASSISTED THE TEMPTATION.
HE WAS THE SON OF MR. WESTON--HE WAS CONTINUALLY HERE--I ALWAYS FOUND
HIM VERY PLEASANT--AND, IN SHORT, FOR (WITH A SIGH) LET ME SWELL OUT THE
CAUSES EVER SO INGENIOUSLY, THEY ALL CENTRE IN THIS AT LAST--MY VANITY
WAS FLATTERED, AND I ALLOWED HIS ATTENTIONS. LATTERLY, HOWEVER--FOR SOME
TIME, INDEED--I HAVE HAD NO IDEA OF THEIR MEANING ANY THING.--I THOUGHT
THEM A HABIT, A TRICK, NOTHING THAT CALLED FOR SERIOUSNESS ON MY SIDE.
HE HAS IMPOSED ON ME, BUT HE HAS NOT INJURED ME. I HAVE NEVER BEEN
ATTACHED TO HIM. AND NOW I CAN TOLERABLY COMPREHEND HIS BEHAVIOUR. HE
NEVER WISHED TO ATTACH ME. IT WAS MERELY A BLIND TO CONCEAL HIS REAL
SITUATION WITH ANOTHER.--IT WAS HIS OBJECT TO BLIND ALL ABOUT HIM; AND
NO ONE, I AM SURE, COULD BE MORE EFFECTUALLY BLINDED THAN MYSELF--EXCEPT
THAT I WAS NOT BLINDED--THAT IT WAS MY GOOD FORTUNE--THAT, IN SHORT, I
WAS SOMEHOW OR OTHER SAFE FROM HIM."

SHE HAD HOPED FOR AN ANSWER HERE--FOR A FEW WORDS TO SAY THAT HER
CONDUCT WAS AT LEAST INTELLIGIBLE; BUT HE WAS SILENT; AND, AS FAR AS SHE
COULD JUDGE, DEEP IN THOUGHT. AT LAST, AND TOLERABLY IN HIS USUAL TONE,
HE SAID,

"I HAVE NEVER HAD A HIGH OPINION OF FRANK CHURCHILL.--I CAN SUPPOSE,
HOWEVER, THAT I MAY HAVE UNDERRATED HIM. MY ACQUAINTANCE WITH HIM HAS
BEEN BUT TRIFLING.--AND EVEN IF I HAVE NOT UNDERRATED HIM HITHERTO, HE
MAY YET TURN OUT WELL.--WITH SUCH A WOMAN HE HAS A CHANCE.--I HAVE NO
MOTIVE FOR WISHING HIM ILL--AND FOR HER SAKE, WHOSE HAPPINESS WILL BE
INVOLVED IN HIS GOOD CHARACTER AND CONDUCT, I SHALL CERTAINLY WISH HIM
WELL."

"I HAVE NO DOUBT OF THEIR BEING HAPPY TOGETHER," SAID EMMA; "I BELIEVE
THEM TO BE VERY MUTUALLY AND VERY SINCERELY ATTACHED."

"HE IS A MOST FORTUNATE MAN!" RETURNED MR. KNIGHTLEY, WITH ENERGY. "SO
EARLY IN LIFE--AT THREE-AND-TWENTY--A PERIOD WHEN, IF A MAN CHUSES A
WIFE, HE GENERALLY CHUSES ILL. AT THREE-AND-TWENTY TO HAVE DRAWN SUCH
A PRIZE! WHAT YEARS OF FELICITY THAT MAN, IN ALL HUMAN CALCULATION,
HAS BEFORE HIM!--ASSURED OF THE LOVE OF SUCH A WOMAN--THE DISINTERESTED
LOVE, FOR JANE FAIRFAX'S CHARACTER VOUCHES FOR HER DISINTERESTEDNESS;
EVERY THING IN HIS FAVOUR,--EQUALITY OF SITUATION--I MEAN, AS FAR AS
REGARDS SOCIETY, AND ALL THE HABITS AND MANNERS THAT ARE IMPORTANT;
EQUALITY IN EVERY POINT BUT ONE--AND THAT ONE, SINCE THE PURITY OF HER
HEART IS NOT TO BE DOUBTED, SUCH AS MUST INCREASE HIS FELICITY, FOR IT
WILL BE HIS TO BESTOW THE ONLY ADVANTAGES SHE WANTS.--A MAN WOULD ALWAYS
WISH TO GIVE A WOMAN A BETTER HOME THAN THE ONE HE TAKES HER FROM;
AND HE WHO CAN DO IT, WHERE THERE IS NO DOUBT OF HER REGARD, MUST,
I THINK, BE THE HAPPIEST OF MORTALS.--FRANK CHURCHILL IS, INDEED, THE
FAVOURITE OF FORTUNE. EVERY THING TURNS OUT FOR HIS GOOD.--HE MEETS
WITH A YOUNG WOMAN AT A WATERING-PLACE, GAINS HER AFFECTION, CANNOT EVEN
WEARY HER BY NEGLIGENT TREATMENT--AND HAD HE AND ALL HIS FAMILY SOUGHT
ROUND THE WORLD FOR A PERFECT WIFE FOR HIM, THEY COULD NOT HAVE FOUND
HER SUPERIOR.--HIS AUNT IS IN THE WAY.--HIS AUNT DIES.--HE HAS ONLY TO
SPEAK.--HIS FRIENDS ARE EAGER TO PROMOTE HIS HAPPINESS.--HE HAD USED
EVERY BODY ILL--AND THEY ARE ALL DELIGHTED TO FORGIVE HIM.--HE IS A
FORTUNATE MAN INDEED!"

"YOU SPEAK AS IF YOU ENVIED HIM."

"AND I DO ENVY HIM, EMMA. IN ONE RESPECT HE IS THE OBJECT OF MY ENVY."

EMMA COULD SAY NO MORE. THEY SEEMED TO BE WITHIN HALF A SENTENCE
OF HARRIET, AND HER IMMEDIATE FEELING WAS TO AVERT THE SUBJECT, IF
POSSIBLE. SHE MADE HER PLAN; SHE WOULD SPEAK OF SOMETHING TOTALLY
DIFFERENT--THE CHILDREN IN BRUNSWICK SQUARE; AND SHE ONLY WAITED FOR
BREATH TO BEGIN, WHEN MR. KNIGHTLEY STARTLED HER, BY SAYING,

"YOU WILL NOT ASK ME WHAT IS THE POINT OF ENVY.--YOU ARE DETERMINED, I
SEE, TO HAVE NO CURIOSITY.--YOU ARE WISE--BUT I CANNOT BE WISE. EMMA,
I MUST TELL YOU WHAT YOU WILL NOT ASK, THOUGH I MAY WISH IT UNSAID THE
NEXT MOMENT."

"OH! THEN, DON'T SPEAK IT, DON'T SPEAK IT," SHE EAGERLY CRIED. "TAKE A
LITTLE TIME, CONSIDER, DO NOT COMMIT YOURSELF."

"THANK YOU," SAID HE, IN AN ACCENT OF DEEP MORTIFICATION, AND NOT
ANOTHER SYLLABLE FOLLOWED.

EMMA COULD NOT BEAR TO GIVE HIM PAIN. HE WAS WISHING TO CONFIDE IN
HER--PERHAPS TO CONSULT HER;--COST HER WHAT IT WOULD, SHE WOULD LISTEN.
SHE MIGHT ASSIST HIS RESOLUTION, OR RECONCILE HIM TO IT; SHE MIGHT GIVE
JUST PRAISE TO HARRIET, OR, BY REPRESENTING TO HIM HIS OWN INDEPENDENCE,
RELIEVE HIM FROM THAT STATE OF INDECISION, WHICH MUST BE MORE
INTOLERABLE THAN ANY ALTERNATIVE TO SUCH A MIND AS HIS.--THEY HAD
REACHED THE HOUSE.

"YOU ARE GOING IN, I SUPPOSE?" SAID HE.

"NO,"--REPLIED EMMA--QUITE CONFIRMED BY THE DEPRESSED MANNER IN WHICH
HE STILL SPOKE--"I SHOULD LIKE TO TAKE ANOTHER TURN. MR. PERRY IS NOT
GONE." AND, AFTER PROCEEDING A FEW STEPS, SHE ADDED--"I STOPPED YOU
UNGRACIOUSLY, JUST NOW, MR. KNIGHTLEY, AND, I AM AFRAID, GAVE YOU
PAIN.--BUT IF YOU HAVE ANY WISH TO SPEAK OPENLY TO ME AS A FRIEND, OR
TO ASK MY OPINION OF ANY THING THAT YOU MAY HAVE IN CONTEMPLATION--AS
A FRIEND, INDEED, YOU MAY COMMAND ME.--I WILL HEAR WHATEVER YOU LIKE. I
WILL TELL YOU EXACTLY WHAT I THINK."

"AS A FRIEND!"--REPEATED MR. KNIGHTLEY.--"EMMA, THAT I FEAR IS A
WORD--NO, I HAVE NO WISH--STAY, YES, WHY SHOULD I HESITATE?--I
HAVE GONE TOO FAR ALREADY FOR CONCEALMENT.--EMMA, I ACCEPT YOUR
OFFER--EXTRAORDINARY AS IT MAY SEEM, I ACCEPT IT, AND REFER MYSELF TO
YOU AS A FRIEND.--TELL ME, THEN, HAVE I NO CHANCE OF EVER SUCCEEDING?"

HE STOPPED IN HIS EARNESTNESS TO LOOK THE QUESTION, AND THE EXPRESSION
OF HIS EYES OVERPOWERED HER.

"MY DEAREST EMMA," SAID HE, "FOR DEAREST YOU WILL ALWAYS BE, WHATEVER
THE EVENT OF THIS HOUR'S CONVERSATION, MY DEAREST, MOST BELOVED
EMMA--TELL ME AT ONCE. SAY 'NO,' IF IT IS TO BE SAID."--SHE COULD
REALLY SAY NOTHING.--"YOU ARE SILENT," HE CRIED, WITH GREAT ANIMATION;
"ABSOLUTELY SILENT! AT PRESENT I ASK NO MORE."

EMMA WAS ALMOST READY TO SINK UNDER THE AGITATION OF THIS MOMENT. THE
DREAD OF BEING AWAKENED FROM THE HAPPIEST DREAM, WAS PERHAPS THE MOST
PROMINENT FEELING.

"I CANNOT MAKE SPEECHES, EMMA:" HE SOON RESUMED; AND IN A TONE OF
SUCH SINCERE, DECIDED, INTELLIGIBLE TENDERNESS AS WAS TOLERABLY
CONVINCING.--"IF I LOVED YOU LESS, I MIGHT BE ABLE TO TALK ABOUT IT
MORE. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I AM.--YOU HEAR NOTHING BUT TRUTH FROM ME.--I
HAVE BLAMED YOU, AND LECTURED YOU, AND YOU HAVE BORNE IT AS NO OTHER
WOMAN IN ENGLAND WOULD HAVE BORNE IT.--BEAR WITH THE TRUTHS I WOULD
TELL YOU NOW, DEAREST EMMA, AS WELL AS YOU HAVE BORNE WITH THEM. THE
MANNER, PERHAPS, MAY HAVE AS LITTLE TO RECOMMEND THEM. GOD KNOWS, I HAVE
BEEN A VERY INDIFFERENT LOVER.--BUT YOU UNDERSTAND ME.--YES, YOU SEE,
YOU UNDERSTAND MY FEELINGS--AND WILL RETURN THEM IF YOU CAN. AT PRESENT,
I ASK ONLY TO HEAR, ONCE TO HEAR YOUR VOICE."

WHILE HE SPOKE, EMMA'S MIND WAS MOST BUSY, AND, WITH ALL THE WONDERFUL
VELOCITY OF THOUGHT, HAD BEEN ABLE--AND YET WITHOUT LOSING A WORD--TO
CATCH AND COMPREHEND THE EXACT TRUTH OF THE WHOLE; TO SEE THAT HARRIET'S
HOPES HAD BEEN ENTIRELY GROUNDLESS, A MISTAKE, A DELUSION, AS COMPLETE A
DELUSION AS ANY OF HER OWN--THAT HARRIET WAS NOTHING; THAT SHE WAS EVERY
THING HERSELF; THAT WHAT SHE HAD BEEN SAYING RELATIVE TO HARRIET
HAD BEEN ALL TAKEN AS THE LANGUAGE OF HER OWN FEELINGS; AND THAT HER
AGITATION, HER DOUBTS, HER RELUCTANCE, HER DISCOURAGEMENT, HAD BEEN ALL
RECEIVED AS DISCOURAGEMENT FROM HERSELF.--AND NOT ONLY WAS THERE TIME
FOR THESE CONVICTIONS, WITH ALL THEIR GLOW OF ATTENDANT HAPPINESS; THERE
WAS TIME ALSO TO REJOICE THAT HARRIET'S SECRET HAD NOT ESCAPED HER, AND
TO RESOLVE THAT IT NEED NOT, AND SHOULD NOT.--IT WAS ALL THE SERVICE
SHE COULD NOW RENDER HER POOR FRIEND; FOR AS TO ANY OF THAT HEROISM OF
SENTIMENT WHICH MIGHT HAVE PROMPTED HER TO ENTREAT HIM TO TRANSFER HIS
AFFECTION FROM HERSELF TO HARRIET, AS INFINITELY THE MOST WORTHY OF THE
TWO--OR EVEN THE MORE SIMPLE SUBLIMITY OF RESOLVING TO REFUSE HIM AT
ONCE AND FOR EVER, WITHOUT VOUCHSAFING ANY MOTIVE, BECAUSE HE COULD NOT
MARRY THEM BOTH, EMMA HAD IT NOT. SHE FELT FOR HARRIET, WITH PAIN AND
WITH CONTRITION; BUT NO FLIGHT OF GENEROSITY RUN MAD, OPPOSING ALL THAT
COULD BE PROBABLE OR REASONABLE, ENTERED HER BRAIN. SHE HAD LED HER
FRIEND ASTRAY, AND IT WOULD BE A REPROACH TO HER FOR EVER; BUT HER
JUDGMENT WAS AS STRONG AS HER FEELINGS, AND AS STRONG AS IT HAD EVER
BEEN BEFORE, IN REPROBATING ANY SUCH ALLIANCE FOR HIM, AS MOST UNEQUAL
AND DEGRADING. HER WAY WAS CLEAR, THOUGH NOT QUITE SMOOTH.--SHE SPOKE
THEN, ON BEING SO ENTREATED.--WHAT DID SHE SAY?--JUST WHAT SHE OUGHT,
OF COURSE. A LADY ALWAYS DOES.--SHE SAID ENOUGH TO SHEW THERE NEED NOT
BE DESPAIR--AND TO INVITE HIM TO SAY MORE HIMSELF. HE HAD DESPAIRED AT
ONE PERIOD; HE HAD RECEIVED SUCH AN INJUNCTION TO CAUTION AND SILENCE,
AS FOR THE TIME CRUSHED EVERY HOPE;--SHE HAD BEGUN BY REFUSING TO HEAR
HIM.--THE CHANGE HAD PERHAPS BEEN SOMEWHAT SUDDEN;--HER PROPOSAL OF
TAKING ANOTHER TURN, HER RENEWING THE CONVERSATION WHICH SHE HAD
JUST PUT AN END TO, MIGHT BE A LITTLE EXTRAORDINARY!--SHE FELT ITS
INCONSISTENCY; BUT MR. KNIGHTLEY WAS SO OBLIGING AS TO PUT UP WITH IT,
AND SEEK NO FARTHER EXPLANATION.

SELDOM, VERY SELDOM, DOES COMPLETE TRUTH BELONG TO ANY HUMAN DISCLOSURE;
SELDOM CAN IT HAPPEN THAT SOMETHING IS NOT A LITTLE DISGUISED, OR A
LITTLE MISTAKEN; BUT WHERE, AS IN THIS CASE, THOUGH THE CONDUCT IS
MISTAKEN, THE FEELINGS ARE NOT, IT MAY NOT BE VERY MATERIAL.--MR.
KNIGHTLEY COULD NOT IMPUTE TO EMMA A MORE RELENTING HEART THAN SHE
POSSESSED, OR A HEART MORE DISPOSED TO ACCEPT OF HIS.

HE HAD, IN FACT, BEEN WHOLLY UNSUSPICIOUS OF HIS OWN INFLUENCE. HE HAD
FOLLOWED HER INTO THE SHRUBBERY WITH NO IDEA OF TRYING IT. HE HAD COME,
IN HIS ANXIETY TO SEE HOW SHE BORE FRANK CHURCHILL'S ENGAGEMENT, WITH NO
SELFISH VIEW, NO VIEW AT ALL, BUT OF ENDEAVOURING, IF SHE ALLOWED HIM AN
OPENING, TO SOOTHE OR TO COUNSEL HER.--THE REST HAD BEEN THE WORK OF
THE MOMENT, THE IMMEDIATE EFFECT OF WHAT HE HEARD, ON HIS FEELINGS. THE
DELIGHTFUL ASSURANCE OF HER TOTAL INDIFFERENCE TOWARDS FRANK CHURCHILL,
OF HER HAVING A HEART COMPLETELY DISENGAGED FROM HIM, HAD GIVEN BIRTH
TO THE HOPE, THAT, IN TIME, HE MIGHT GAIN HER AFFECTION HIMSELF;--BUT
IT HAD BEEN NO PRESENT HOPE--HE HAD ONLY, IN THE MOMENTARY CONQUEST OF
EAGERNESS OVER JUDGMENT, ASPIRED TO BE TOLD THAT SHE DID NOT FORBID HIS
ATTEMPT TO ATTACH HER.--THE SUPERIOR HOPES WHICH GRADUALLY OPENED WERE
SO MUCH THE MORE ENCHANTING.--THE AFFECTION, WHICH HE HAD BEEN ASKING
TO BE ALLOWED TO CREATE, IF HE COULD, WAS ALREADY HIS!--WITHIN HALF
AN HOUR, HE HAD PASSED FROM A THOROUGHLY DISTRESSED STATE OF MIND, TO
SOMETHING SO LIKE PERFECT HAPPINESS, THAT IT COULD BEAR NO OTHER NAME.

HER CHANGE WAS EQUAL.--THIS ONE HALF-HOUR HAD GIVEN TO EACH THE SAME
PRECIOUS CERTAINTY OF BEING BELOVED, HAD CLEARED FROM EACH THE SAME
DEGREE OF IGNORANCE, JEALOUSY, OR DISTRUST.--ON HIS SIDE, THERE HAD BEEN
A LONG-STANDING JEALOUSY, OLD AS THE ARRIVAL, OR EVEN THE EXPECTATION,
OF FRANK CHURCHILL.--HE HAD BEEN IN LOVE WITH EMMA, AND JEALOUS OF FRANK
CHURCHILL, FROM ABOUT THE SAME PERIOD, ONE SENTIMENT HAVING PROBABLY
ENLIGHTENED HIM AS TO THE OTHER. IT WAS HIS JEALOUSY OF FRANK CHURCHILL
THAT HAD TAKEN HIM FROM THE COUNTRY.--THE BOX HILL PARTY HAD DECIDED
HIM ON GOING AWAY. HE WOULD SAVE HIMSELF FROM WITNESSING AGAIN
SUCH PERMITTED, ENCOURAGED ATTENTIONS.--HE HAD GONE TO LEARN TO BE
INDIFFERENT.--BUT HE HAD GONE TO A WRONG PLACE. THERE WAS TOO MUCH
DOMESTIC HAPPINESS IN HIS BROTHER'S HOUSE; WOMAN WORE TOO AMIABLE A FORM
IN IT; ISABELLA WAS TOO MUCH LIKE EMMA--DIFFERING ONLY IN THOSE STRIKING
INFERIORITIES, WHICH ALWAYS BROUGHT THE OTHER IN BRILLIANCY BEFORE
HIM, FOR MUCH TO HAVE BEEN DONE, EVEN HAD HIS TIME BEEN LONGER.--HE HAD
STAYED ON, HOWEVER, VIGOROUSLY, DAY AFTER DAY--TILL THIS VERY MORNING'S
POST HAD CONVEYED THE HISTORY OF JANE FAIRFAX.--THEN, WITH THE GLADNESS
WHICH MUST BE FELT, NAY, WHICH HE DID NOT SCRUPLE TO FEEL, HAVING NEVER
BELIEVED FRANK CHURCHILL TO BE AT ALL DESERVING EMMA, WAS THERE SO MUCH
FOND SOLICITUDE, SO MUCH KEEN ANXIETY FOR HER, THAT HE COULD STAY NO
LONGER. HE HAD RIDDEN HOME THROUGH THE RAIN; AND HAD WALKED UP DIRECTLY
AFTER DINNER, TO SEE HOW THIS SWEETEST AND BEST OF ALL CREATURES,
FAULTLESS IN SPITE OF ALL HER FAULTS, BORE THE DISCOVERY.

HE HAD FOUND HER AGITATED AND LOW.--FRANK CHURCHILL WAS A VILLAIN.--
HE HEARD HER DECLARE THAT SHE HAD NEVER LOVED HIM. FRANK CHURCHILL'S
CHARACTER WAS NOT DESPERATE.--SHE WAS HIS OWN EMMA, BY HAND AND WORD,
WHEN THEY RETURNED INTO THE HOUSE; AND IF HE COULD HAVE THOUGHT OF FRANK
CHURCHILL THEN, HE MIGHT HAVE DEEMED HIM A VERY GOOD SORT OF FELLOW.



CHAPTER XIV


WHAT TOTALLY DIFFERENT FEELINGS DID EMMA TAKE BACK INTO THE HOUSE FROM
WHAT SHE HAD BROUGHT OUT!--SHE HAD THEN BEEN ONLY DARING TO HOPE FOR
A LITTLE RESPITE OF SUFFERING;--SHE WAS NOW IN AN EXQUISITE FLUTTER OF
HAPPINESS, AND SUCH HAPPINESS MOREOVER AS SHE BELIEVED MUST STILL BE
GREATER WHEN THE FLUTTER SHOULD HAVE PASSED AWAY.

THEY SAT DOWN TO TEA--THE SAME PARTY ROUND THE SAME TABLE--HOW OFTEN
IT HAD BEEN COLLECTED!--AND HOW OFTEN HAD HER EYES FALLEN ON THE SAME
SHRUBS IN THE LAWN, AND OBSERVED THE SAME BEAUTIFUL EFFECT OF THE
WESTERN SUN!--BUT NEVER IN SUCH A STATE OF SPIRITS, NEVER IN ANY THING
LIKE IT; AND IT WAS WITH DIFFICULTY THAT SHE COULD SUMMON ENOUGH OF HER
USUAL SELF TO BE THE ATTENTIVE LADY OF THE HOUSE, OR EVEN THE ATTENTIVE
DAUGHTER.

POOR MR. WOODHOUSE LITTLE SUSPECTED WHAT WAS PLOTTING AGAINST HIM IN THE
BREAST OF THAT MAN WHOM HE WAS SO CORDIALLY WELCOMING, AND SO ANXIOUSLY
HOPING MIGHT NOT HAVE TAKEN COLD FROM HIS RIDE.--COULD HE HAVE SEEN THE
HEART, HE WOULD HAVE CARED VERY LITTLE FOR THE LUNGS; BUT WITHOUT THE
MOST DISTANT IMAGINATION OF THE IMPENDING EVIL, WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST
PERCEPTION OF ANY THING EXTRAORDINARY IN THE LOOKS OR WAYS OF EITHER,
HE REPEATED TO THEM VERY COMFORTABLY ALL THE ARTICLES OF NEWS HE HAD
RECEIVED FROM MR. PERRY, AND TALKED ON WITH MUCH SELF-CONTENTMENT,
TOTALLY UNSUSPICIOUS OF WHAT THEY COULD HAVE TOLD HIM IN RETURN.

AS LONG AS MR. KNIGHTLEY REMAINED WITH THEM, EMMA'S FEVER CONTINUED;
BUT WHEN HE WAS GONE, SHE BEGAN TO BE A LITTLE TRANQUILLISED AND
SUBDUED--AND IN THE COURSE OF THE SLEEPLESS NIGHT, WHICH WAS THE TAX
FOR SUCH AN EVENING, SHE FOUND ONE OR TWO SUCH VERY SERIOUS POINTS
TO CONSIDER, AS MADE HER FEEL, THAT EVEN HER HAPPINESS MUST HAVE SOME
ALLOY. HER FATHER--AND HARRIET. SHE COULD NOT BE ALONE WITHOUT FEELING
THE FULL WEIGHT OF THEIR SEPARATE CLAIMS; AND HOW TO GUARD THE COMFORT
OF BOTH TO THE UTMOST, WAS THE QUESTION. WITH RESPECT TO HER FATHER,
IT WAS A QUESTION SOON ANSWERED. SHE HARDLY KNEW YET WHAT MR. KNIGHTLEY
WOULD ASK; BUT A VERY SHORT PARLEY WITH HER OWN HEART PRODUCED THE MOST
SOLEMN RESOLUTION OF NEVER QUITTING HER FATHER.--SHE EVEN WEPT OVER
THE IDEA OF IT, AS A SIN OF THOUGHT. WHILE HE LIVED, IT MUST BE ONLY AN
ENGAGEMENT; BUT SHE FLATTERED HERSELF, THAT IF DIVESTED OF THE DANGER OF
DRAWING HER AWAY, IT MIGHT BECOME AN INCREASE OF COMFORT TO HIM.--HOW
TO DO HER BEST BY HARRIET, WAS OF MORE DIFFICULT DECISION;--HOW TO SPARE
HER FROM ANY UNNECESSARY PAIN; HOW TO MAKE HER ANY POSSIBLE ATONEMENT;
HOW TO APPEAR LEAST HER ENEMY?--ON THESE SUBJECTS, HER PERPLEXITY
AND DISTRESS WERE VERY GREAT--AND HER MIND HAD TO PASS AGAIN AND
AGAIN THROUGH EVERY BITTER REPROACH AND SORROWFUL REGRET THAT HAD EVER
SURROUNDED IT.--SHE COULD ONLY RESOLVE AT LAST, THAT SHE WOULD STILL
AVOID A MEETING WITH HER, AND COMMUNICATE ALL THAT NEED BE TOLD BY
LETTER; THAT IT WOULD BE INEXPRESSIBLY DESIRABLE TO HAVE HER REMOVED
JUST NOW FOR A TIME FROM HIGHBURY, AND--INDULGING IN ONE SCHEME
MORE--NEARLY RESOLVE, THAT IT MIGHT BE PRACTICABLE TO GET AN INVITATION
FOR HER TO BRUNSWICK SQUARE.--ISABELLA HAD BEEN PLEASED WITH HARRIET;
AND A FEW WEEKS SPENT IN LONDON MUST GIVE HER SOME AMUSEMENT.--SHE DID
NOT THINK IT IN HARRIET'S NATURE TO ESCAPE BEING BENEFITED BY NOVELTY
AND VARIETY, BY THE STREETS, THE SHOPS, AND THE CHILDREN.--AT ANY RATE,
IT WOULD BE A PROOF OF ATTENTION AND KINDNESS IN HERSELF, FROM WHOM
EVERY THING WAS DUE; A SEPARATION FOR THE PRESENT; AN AVERTING OF THE
EVIL DAY, WHEN THEY MUST ALL BE TOGETHER AGAIN.

SHE ROSE EARLY, AND WROTE HER LETTER TO HARRIET; AN EMPLOYMENT WHICH
LEFT HER SO VERY SERIOUS, SO NEARLY SAD, THAT MR. KNIGHTLEY, IN WALKING
UP TO HARTFIELD TO BREAKFAST, DID NOT ARRIVE AT ALL TOO SOON; AND HALF
AN HOUR STOLEN AFTERWARDS TO GO OVER THE SAME GROUND AGAIN WITH HIM,
LITERALLY AND FIGURATIVELY, WAS QUITE NECESSARY TO REINSTATE HER IN A
PROPER SHARE OF THE HAPPINESS OF THE EVENING BEFORE.

HE HAD NOT LEFT HER LONG, BY NO MEANS LONG ENOUGH FOR HER TO HAVE THE
SLIGHTEST INCLINATION FOR THINKING OF ANY BODY ELSE, WHEN A LETTER WAS
BROUGHT HER FROM RANDALLS--A VERY THICK LETTER;--SHE GUESSED WHAT IT
MUST CONTAIN, AND DEPRECATED THE NECESSITY OF READING IT.--SHE WAS NOW
IN PERFECT CHARITY WITH FRANK CHURCHILL; SHE WANTED NO EXPLANATIONS, SHE
WANTED ONLY TO HAVE HER THOUGHTS TO HERSELF--AND AS FOR UNDERSTANDING
ANY THING HE WROTE, SHE WAS SURE SHE WAS INCAPABLE OF IT.--IT MUST BE
WADED THROUGH, HOWEVER. SHE OPENED THE PACKET; IT WAS TOO SURELY SO;--A
NOTE FROM MRS. WESTON TO HERSELF, USHERED IN THE LETTER FROM FRANK TO
MRS. WESTON.

"I HAVE THE GREATEST PLEASURE, MY DEAR EMMA, IN FORWARDING TO YOU THE
ENCLOSED. I KNOW WHAT THOROUGH JUSTICE YOU WILL DO IT, AND HAVE SCARCELY
A DOUBT OF ITS HAPPY EFFECT.--I THINK WE SHALL NEVER MATERIALLY DISAGREE
ABOUT THE WRITER AGAIN; BUT I WILL NOT DELAY YOU BY A LONG PREFACE.--WE
ARE QUITE WELL.--THIS LETTER HAS BEEN THE CURE OF ALL THE LITTLE
NERVOUSNESS I HAVE BEEN FEELING LATELY.--I DID NOT QUITE LIKE YOUR LOOKS
ON TUESDAY, BUT IT WAS AN UNGENIAL MORNING; AND THOUGH YOU WILL NEVER
OWN BEING AFFECTED BY WEATHER, I THINK EVERY BODY FEELS A NORTH-EAST
WIND.--I FELT FOR YOUR DEAR FATHER VERY MUCH IN THE STORM OF TUESDAY
AFTERNOON AND YESTERDAY MORNING, BUT HAD THE COMFORT OF HEARING LAST
NIGHT, BY MR. PERRY, THAT IT HAD NOT MADE HIM ILL.

                              "YOURS EVER,
                                                       "A. W."


                                                       WINDSOR-JULY.
MY DEAR MADAM,

"IF I MADE MYSELF INTELLIGIBLE YESTERDAY, THIS LETTER WILL BE
EXPECTED; BUT EXPECTED OR NOT, I KNOW IT WILL BE READ WITH CANDOUR AND
INDULGENCE.--YOU ARE ALL GOODNESS, AND I BELIEVE THERE WILL BE NEED OF
EVEN ALL YOUR GOODNESS TO ALLOW FOR SOME PARTS OF MY PAST CONDUCT.--BUT
I HAVE BEEN FORGIVEN BY ONE WHO HAD STILL MORE TO RESENT. MY COURAGE
RISES WHILE I WRITE. IT IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR THE PROSPEROUS TO BE
HUMBLE. I HAVE ALREADY MET WITH SUCH SUCCESS IN TWO APPLICATIONS FOR
PARDON, THAT I MAY BE IN DANGER OF THINKING MYSELF TOO SURE OF YOURS,
AND OF THOSE AMONG YOUR FRIENDS WHO HAVE HAD ANY GROUND OF OFFENCE.--YOU
MUST ALL ENDEAVOUR TO COMPREHEND THE EXACT NATURE OF MY SITUATION WHEN I
FIRST ARRIVED AT RANDALLS; YOU MUST CONSIDER ME AS HAVING A SECRET WHICH
WAS TO BE KEPT AT ALL HAZARDS. THIS WAS THE FACT. MY RIGHT TO PLACE
MYSELF IN A SITUATION REQUIRING SUCH CONCEALMENT, IS ANOTHER QUESTION.
I SHALL NOT DISCUSS IT HERE. FOR MY TEMPTATION TO THINK IT A RIGHT,
I REFER EVERY CAVILLER TO A BRICK HOUSE, SASHED WINDOWS BELOW, AND
CASEMENTS ABOVE, IN HIGHBURY. I DARED NOT ADDRESS HER OPENLY; MY
DIFFICULTIES IN THE THEN STATE OF ENSCOMBE MUST BE TOO WELL KNOWN TO
REQUIRE DEFINITION; AND I WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO PREVAIL, BEFORE WE
PARTED AT WEYMOUTH, AND TO INDUCE THE MOST UPRIGHT FEMALE MIND IN THE
CREATION TO STOOP IN CHARITY TO A SECRET ENGAGEMENT.--HAD SHE REFUSED, I
SHOULD HAVE GONE MAD.--BUT YOU WILL BE READY TO SAY, WHAT WAS YOUR
HOPE IN DOING THIS?--WHAT DID YOU LOOK FORWARD TO?--TO ANY THING, EVERY
THING--TO TIME, CHANCE, CIRCUMSTANCE, SLOW EFFECTS, SUDDEN BURSTS,
PERSEVERANCE AND WEARINESS, HEALTH AND SICKNESS. EVERY POSSIBILITY OF
GOOD WAS BEFORE ME, AND THE FIRST OF BLESSINGS SECURED, IN OBTAINING HER
PROMISES OF FAITH AND CORRESPONDENCE. IF YOU NEED FARTHER EXPLANATION,
I HAVE THE HONOUR, MY DEAR MADAM, OF BEING YOUR HUSBAND'S SON, AND
THE ADVANTAGE OF INHERITING A DISPOSITION TO HOPE FOR GOOD, WHICH NO
INHERITANCE OF HOUSES OR LANDS CAN EVER EQUAL THE VALUE OF.--SEE
ME, THEN, UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, ARRIVING ON MY FIRST VISIT TO
RANDALLS;--AND HERE I AM CONSCIOUS OF WRONG, FOR THAT VISIT MIGHT HAVE
BEEN SOONER PAID. YOU WILL LOOK BACK AND SEE THAT I DID NOT COME TILL
MISS FAIRFAX WAS IN HIGHBURY; AND AS YOU WERE THE PERSON SLIGHTED, YOU
WILL FORGIVE ME INSTANTLY; BUT I MUST WORK ON MY FATHER'S COMPASSION, BY
REMINDING HIM, THAT SO LONG AS I ABSENTED MYSELF FROM HIS HOUSE, SO LONG
I LOST THE BLESSING OF KNOWING YOU. MY BEHAVIOUR, DURING THE VERY
HAPPY FORTNIGHT WHICH I SPENT WITH YOU, DID NOT, I HOPE, LAY ME OPEN TO
REPREHENSION, EXCEPTING ON ONE POINT. AND NOW I COME TO THE PRINCIPAL,
THE ONLY IMPORTANT PART OF MY CONDUCT WHILE BELONGING TO YOU, WHICH
EXCITES MY OWN ANXIETY, OR REQUIRES VERY SOLICITOUS EXPLANATION. WITH
THE GREATEST RESPECT, AND THE WARMEST FRIENDSHIP, DO I MENTION MISS
WOODHOUSE; MY FATHER PERHAPS WILL THINK I OUGHT TO ADD, WITH THE DEEPEST
HUMILIATION.--A FEW WORDS WHICH DROPPED FROM HIM YESTERDAY SPOKE HIS
OPINION, AND SOME CENSURE I ACKNOWLEDGE MYSELF LIABLE TO.--MY BEHAVIOUR
TO MISS WOODHOUSE INDICATED, I BELIEVE, MORE THAN IT OUGHT.--IN ORDER TO
ASSIST A CONCEALMENT SO ESSENTIAL TO ME, I WAS LED ON TO MAKE MORE THAN
AN ALLOWABLE USE OF THE SORT OF INTIMACY INTO WHICH WE WERE IMMEDIATELY
THROWN.--I CANNOT DENY THAT MISS WOODHOUSE WAS MY OSTENSIBLE OBJECT--BUT
I AM SURE YOU WILL BELIEVE THE DECLARATION, THAT HAD I NOT BEEN
CONVINCED OF HER INDIFFERENCE, I WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN INDUCED BY ANY
SELFISH VIEWS TO GO ON.--AMIABLE AND DELIGHTFUL AS MISS WOODHOUSE IS,
SHE NEVER GAVE ME THE IDEA OF A YOUNG WOMAN LIKELY TO BE ATTACHED; AND
THAT SHE WAS PERFECTLY FREE FROM ANY TENDENCY TO BEING ATTACHED TO ME,
WAS AS MUCH MY CONVICTION AS MY WISH.--SHE RECEIVED MY ATTENTIONS WITH
AN EASY, FRIENDLY, GOODHUMOURED PLAYFULNESS, WHICH EXACTLY SUITED ME.
WE SEEMED TO UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER. FROM OUR RELATIVE SITUATION, THOSE
ATTENTIONS WERE HER DUE, AND WERE FELT TO BE SO.--WHETHER MISS WOODHOUSE
BEGAN REALLY TO UNDERSTAND ME BEFORE THE EXPIRATION OF THAT FORTNIGHT,
I CANNOT SAY;--WHEN I CALLED TO TAKE LEAVE OF HER, I REMEMBER THAT I WAS
WITHIN A MOMENT OF CONFESSING THE TRUTH, AND I THEN FANCIED SHE WAS NOT
WITHOUT SUSPICION; BUT I HAVE NO DOUBT OF HER HAVING SINCE DETECTED ME,
AT LEAST IN SOME DEGREE.--SHE MAY NOT HAVE SURMISED THE WHOLE, BUT HER
QUICKNESS MUST HAVE PENETRATED A PART. I CANNOT DOUBT IT. YOU WILL FIND,
WHENEVER THE SUBJECT BECOMES FREED FROM ITS PRESENT RESTRAINTS, THAT IT
DID NOT TAKE HER WHOLLY BY SURPRIZE. SHE FREQUENTLY GAVE ME HINTS OF IT.
I REMEMBER HER TELLING ME AT THE BALL, THAT I OWED MRS. ELTON GRATITUDE
FOR HER ATTENTIONS TO MISS FAIRFAX.--I HOPE THIS HISTORY OF MY CONDUCT
TOWARDS HER WILL BE ADMITTED BY YOU AND MY FATHER AS GREAT EXTENUATION
OF WHAT YOU SAW AMISS. WHILE YOU CONSIDERED ME AS HAVING SINNED AGAINST
EMMA WOODHOUSE, I COULD DESERVE NOTHING FROM EITHER. ACQUIT ME HERE, AND
PROCURE FOR ME, WHEN IT IS ALLOWABLE, THE ACQUITTAL AND GOOD WISHES
OF THAT SAID EMMA WOODHOUSE, WHOM I REGARD WITH SO MUCH BROTHERLY
AFFECTION, AS TO LONG TO HAVE HER AS DEEPLY AND AS HAPPILY IN LOVE AS
MYSELF.--WHATEVER STRANGE THINGS I SAID OR DID DURING THAT FORTNIGHT,
YOU HAVE NOW A KEY TO. MY HEART WAS IN HIGHBURY, AND MY BUSINESS WAS TO
GET MY BODY THITHER AS OFTEN AS MIGHT BE, AND WITH THE LEAST SUSPICION.
IF YOU REMEMBER ANY QUEERNESSES, SET THEM ALL TO THE RIGHT ACCOUNT.--OF
THE PIANOFORTE SO MUCH TALKED OF, I FEEL IT ONLY NECESSARY TO SAY, THAT
ITS BEING ORDERED WAS ABSOLUTELY UNKNOWN TO MISS F--, WHO WOULD NEVER
HAVE ALLOWED ME TO SEND IT, HAD ANY CHOICE BEEN GIVEN HER.--THE
DELICACY OF HER MIND THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE ENGAGEMENT, MY DEAR MADAM,
IS MUCH BEYOND MY POWER OF DOING JUSTICE TO. YOU WILL SOON, I EARNESTLY
HOPE, KNOW HER THOROUGHLY YOURSELF.--NO DESCRIPTION CAN DESCRIBE HER.
SHE MUST TELL YOU HERSELF WHAT SHE IS--YET NOT BY WORD, FOR NEVER
WAS THERE A HUMAN CREATURE WHO WOULD SO DESIGNEDLY SUPPRESS HER OWN
MERIT.--SINCE I BEGAN THIS LETTER, WHICH WILL BE LONGER THAN I FORESAW,
I HAVE HEARD FROM HER.--SHE GIVES A GOOD ACCOUNT OF HER OWN HEALTH; BUT
AS SHE NEVER COMPLAINS, I DARE NOT DEPEND. I WANT TO HAVE YOUR OPINION
OF HER LOOKS. I KNOW YOU WILL SOON CALL ON HER; SHE IS LIVING IN DREAD
OF THE VISIT. PERHAPS IT IS PAID ALREADY. LET ME HEAR FROM YOU WITHOUT
DELAY; I AM IMPATIENT FOR A THOUSAND PARTICULARS. REMEMBER HOW FEW
MINUTES I WAS AT RANDALLS, AND IN HOW BEWILDERED, HOW MAD A STATE: AND
I AM NOT MUCH BETTER YET; STILL INSANE EITHER FROM HAPPINESS OR
MISERY. WHEN I THINK OF THE KINDNESS AND FAVOUR I HAVE MET WITH, OF HER
EXCELLENCE AND PATIENCE, AND MY UNCLE'S GENEROSITY, I AM MAD WITH JOY:
BUT WHEN I RECOLLECT ALL THE UNEASINESS I OCCASIONED HER, AND HOW LITTLE
I DESERVE TO BE FORGIVEN, I AM MAD WITH ANGER. IF I COULD BUT SEE HER
AGAIN!--BUT I MUST NOT PROPOSE IT YET. MY UNCLE HAS BEEN TOO GOOD FOR ME
TO ENCROACH.--I MUST STILL ADD TO THIS LONG LETTER. YOU HAVE NOT HEARD
ALL THAT YOU OUGHT TO HEAR. I COULD NOT GIVE ANY CONNECTED DETAIL
YESTERDAY; BUT THE SUDDENNESS, AND, IN ONE LIGHT, THE UNSEASONABLENESS
WITH WHICH THE AFFAIR BURST OUT, NEEDS EXPLANATION; FOR THOUGH THE EVENT
OF THE 26TH ULT., AS YOU WILL CONCLUDE, IMMEDIATELY OPENED TO ME THE
HAPPIEST PROSPECTS, I SHOULD NOT HAVE PRESUMED ON SUCH EARLY MEASURES,
BUT FROM THE VERY PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES, WHICH LEFT ME NOT AN HOUR TO
LOSE. I SHOULD MYSELF HAVE SHRUNK FROM ANY THING SO HASTY, AND SHE
WOULD HAVE FELT EVERY SCRUPLE OF MINE WITH MULTIPLIED STRENGTH AND
REFINEMENT.--BUT I HAD NO CHOICE. THE HASTY ENGAGEMENT SHE HAD ENTERED
INTO WITH THAT WOMAN--HERE, MY DEAR MADAM, I WAS OBLIGED TO LEAVE OFF
ABRUPTLY, TO RECOLLECT AND COMPOSE MYSELF.--I HAVE BEEN WALKING OVER
THE COUNTRY, AND AM NOW, I HOPE, RATIONAL ENOUGH TO MAKE THE REST OF
MY LETTER WHAT IT OUGHT TO BE.--IT IS, IN FACT, A MOST MORTIFYING
RETROSPECT FOR ME. I BEHAVED SHAMEFULLY. AND HERE I CAN ADMIT, THAT
MY MANNERS TO MISS W., IN BEING UNPLEASANT TO MISS F., WERE HIGHLY
BLAMEABLE. SHE DISAPPROVED THEM, WHICH OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN ENOUGH.--MY
PLEA OF CONCEALING THE TRUTH SHE DID NOT THINK SUFFICIENT.--SHE WAS
DISPLEASED; I THOUGHT UNREASONABLY SO: I THOUGHT HER, ON A THOUSAND
OCCASIONS, UNNECESSARILY SCRUPULOUS AND CAUTIOUS: I THOUGHT HER EVEN
COLD. BUT SHE WAS ALWAYS RIGHT. IF I HAD FOLLOWED HER JUDGMENT, AND
SUBDUED MY SPIRITS TO THE LEVEL OF WHAT SHE DEEMED PROPER, I SHOULD HAVE
ESCAPED THE GREATEST UNHAPPINESS I HAVE EVER KNOWN.--WE QUARRELLED.--
DO YOU REMEMBER THE MORNING SPENT AT DONWELL?--THERE EVERY LITTLE
DISSATISFACTION THAT HAD OCCURRED BEFORE CAME TO A CRISIS. I WAS LATE;
I MET HER WALKING HOME BY HERSELF, AND WANTED TO WALK WITH HER, BUT SHE
WOULD NOT SUFFER IT. SHE ABSOLUTELY REFUSED TO ALLOW ME, WHICH I THEN
THOUGHT MOST UNREASONABLE. NOW, HOWEVER, I SEE NOTHING IN IT BUT A VERY
NATURAL AND CONSISTENT DEGREE OF DISCRETION. WHILE I, TO BLIND THE
WORLD TO OUR ENGAGEMENT, WAS BEHAVING ONE HOUR WITH OBJECTIONABLE
PARTICULARITY TO ANOTHER WOMAN, WAS SHE TO BE CONSENTING THE NEXT TO A
PROPOSAL WHICH MIGHT HAVE MADE EVERY PREVIOUS CAUTION USELESS?--HAD WE
BEEN MET WALKING TOGETHER BETWEEN DONWELL AND HIGHBURY, THE TRUTH MUST
HAVE BEEN SUSPECTED.--I WAS MAD ENOUGH, HOWEVER, TO RESENT.--I DOUBTED
HER AFFECTION. I DOUBTED IT MORE THE NEXT DAY ON BOX HILL; WHEN,
PROVOKED BY SUCH CONDUCT ON MY SIDE, SUCH SHAMEFUL, INSOLENT NEGLECT
OF HER, AND SUCH APPARENT DEVOTION TO MISS W., AS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN
IMPOSSIBLE FOR ANY WOMAN OF SENSE TO ENDURE, SHE SPOKE HER RESENTMENT IN
A FORM OF WORDS PERFECTLY INTELLIGIBLE TO ME.--IN SHORT, MY DEAR
MADAM, IT WAS A QUARREL BLAMELESS ON HER SIDE, ABOMINABLE ON MINE; AND
I RETURNED THE SAME EVENING TO RICHMOND, THOUGH I MIGHT HAVE STAID WITH
YOU TILL THE NEXT MORNING, MERELY BECAUSE I WOULD BE AS ANGRY WITH
HER AS POSSIBLE. EVEN THEN, I WAS NOT SUCH A FOOL AS NOT TO MEAN TO
BE RECONCILED IN TIME; BUT I WAS THE INJURED PERSON, INJURED BY HER
COLDNESS, AND I WENT AWAY DETERMINED THAT SHE SHOULD MAKE THE FIRST
ADVANCES.--I SHALL ALWAYS CONGRATULATE MYSELF THAT YOU WERE NOT OF
THE BOX HILL PARTY. HAD YOU WITNESSED MY BEHAVIOUR THERE, I CAN HARDLY
SUPPOSE YOU WOULD EVER HAVE THOUGHT WELL OF ME AGAIN. ITS EFFECT UPON
HER APPEARS IN THE IMMEDIATE RESOLUTION IT PRODUCED: AS SOON AS SHE
FOUND I WAS REALLY GONE FROM RANDALLS, SHE CLOSED WITH THE OFFER OF THAT
OFFICIOUS MRS. ELTON; THE WHOLE SYSTEM OF WHOSE TREATMENT OF HER, BY THE
BYE, HAS EVER FILLED ME WITH INDIGNATION AND HATRED. I MUST NOT QUARREL
WITH A SPIRIT OF FORBEARANCE WHICH HAS BEEN SO RICHLY EXTENDED TOWARDS
MYSELF; BUT, OTHERWISE, I SHOULD LOUDLY PROTEST AGAINST THE SHARE OF IT
WHICH THAT WOMAN HAS KNOWN.--'JANE,' INDEED!--YOU WILL OBSERVE THAT I
HAVE NOT YET INDULGED MYSELF IN CALLING HER BY THAT NAME, EVEN TO YOU.
THINK, THEN, WHAT I MUST HAVE ENDURED IN HEARING IT BANDIED BETWEEN
THE ELTONS WITH ALL THE VULGARITY OF NEEDLESS REPETITION, AND ALL THE
INSOLENCE OF IMAGINARY SUPERIORITY. HAVE PATIENCE WITH ME, I SHALL SOON
HAVE DONE.--SHE CLOSED WITH THIS OFFER, RESOLVING TO BREAK WITH ME
ENTIRELY, AND WROTE THE NEXT DAY TO TELL ME THAT WE NEVER WERE TO MEET
AGAIN.--SHE FELT THE ENGAGEMENT TO BE A SOURCE OF
REPENTANCE AND MISERY TO EACH: SHE DISSOLVED IT.--THIS
LETTER REACHED ME ON THE VERY MORNING OF MY POOR AUNT'S DEATH. I
ANSWERED IT WITHIN AN HOUR; BUT FROM THE CONFUSION OF MY MIND, AND THE
MULTIPLICITY OF BUSINESS FALLING ON ME AT ONCE, MY ANSWER, INSTEAD OF
BEING SENT WITH ALL THE MANY OTHER LETTERS OF THAT DAY, WAS LOCKED UP IN
MY WRITING-DESK; AND I, TRUSTING THAT I HAD WRITTEN ENOUGH, THOUGH BUT
A FEW LINES, TO SATISFY HER, REMAINED WITHOUT ANY UNEASINESS.--I WAS
RATHER DISAPPOINTED THAT I DID NOT HEAR FROM HER AGAIN SPEEDILY; BUT I
MADE EXCUSES FOR HER, AND WAS TOO BUSY, AND--MAY I ADD?--TOO CHEERFUL
IN MY VIEWS TO BE CAPTIOUS.--WE REMOVED TO WINDSOR; AND TWO
DAYS AFTERWARDS I RECEIVED A PARCEL FROM HER, MY OWN LETTERS ALL
RETURNED!--AND A FEW LINES AT THE SAME TIME BY THE POST, STATING HER
EXTREME SURPRIZE AT NOT HAVING HAD THE SMALLEST REPLY TO HER LAST; AND
ADDING, THAT AS SILENCE ON SUCH A POINT COULD NOT BE MISCONSTRUED,
AND AS IT MUST BE EQUALLY DESIRABLE TO BOTH TO HAVE EVERY SUBORDINATE
ARRANGEMENT CONCLUDED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, SHE NOW SENT ME, BY A SAFE
CONVEYANCE, ALL MY LETTERS, AND REQUESTED, THAT IF I COULD NOT DIRECTLY
COMMAND HERS, SO AS TO SEND THEM TO HIGHBURY WITHIN A WEEK, I WOULD
FORWARD THEM AFTER THAT PERIOD TO HER AT--: IN SHORT, THE FULL DIRECTION
TO MR. SMALLRIDGE'S, NEAR BRISTOL, STARED ME IN THE FACE. I KNEW THE
NAME, THE PLACE, I KNEW ALL ABOUT IT, AND INSTANTLY SAW WHAT SHE HAD
BEEN DOING. IT WAS PERFECTLY ACCORDANT WITH THAT RESOLUTION OF CHARACTER
WHICH I KNEW HER TO POSSESS; AND THE SECRECY SHE HAD MAINTAINED, AS TO
ANY SUCH DESIGN IN HER FORMER LETTER, WAS EQUALLY DESCRIPTIVE OF ITS
ANXIOUS DELICACY. FOR THE WORLD WOULD NOT SHE HAVE SEEMED TO THREATEN
ME.--IMAGINE THE SHOCK; IMAGINE HOW, TILL I HAD ACTUALLY DETECTED MY
OWN BLUNDER, I RAVED AT THE BLUNDERS OF THE POST.--WHAT WAS TO BE
DONE?--ONE THING ONLY.--I MUST SPEAK TO MY UNCLE. WITHOUT HIS SANCTION I
COULD NOT HOPE TO BE LISTENED TO AGAIN.--I SPOKE; CIRCUMSTANCES WERE
IN MY FAVOUR; THE LATE EVENT HAD SOFTENED AWAY HIS PRIDE, AND HE WAS,
EARLIER THAN I COULD HAVE ANTICIPATED, WHOLLY RECONCILED AND COMPLYING;
AND COULD SAY AT LAST, POOR MAN! WITH A DEEP SIGH, THAT HE WISHED I
MIGHT FIND AS MUCH HAPPINESS IN THE MARRIAGE STATE AS HE HAD DONE.--I
FELT THAT IT WOULD BE OF A DIFFERENT SORT.--ARE YOU DISPOSED TO PITY
ME FOR WHAT I MUST HAVE SUFFERED IN OPENING THE CAUSE TO HIM, FOR MY
SUSPENSE WHILE ALL WAS AT STAKE?--NO; DO NOT PITY ME TILL I REACHED
HIGHBURY, AND SAW HOW ILL I HAD MADE HER. DO NOT PITY ME TILL I SAW HER
WAN, SICK LOOKS.--I REACHED HIGHBURY AT THE TIME OF DAY WHEN, FROM MY
KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR LATE BREAKFAST HOUR, I WAS CERTAIN OF A GOOD CHANCE
OF FINDING HER ALONE.--I WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED; AND AT LAST I WAS NOT
DISAPPOINTED EITHER IN THE OBJECT OF MY JOURNEY. A GREAT DEAL OF VERY
REASONABLE, VERY JUST DISPLEASURE I HAD TO PERSUADE AWAY. BUT IT IS
DONE; WE ARE RECONCILED, DEARER, MUCH DEARER, THAN EVER, AND NO MOMENT'S
UNEASINESS CAN EVER OCCUR BETWEEN US AGAIN. NOW, MY DEAR MADAM, I WILL
RELEASE YOU; BUT I COULD NOT CONCLUDE BEFORE. A THOUSAND AND A THOUSAND
THANKS FOR ALL THE KINDNESS YOU HAVE EVER SHEWN ME, AND TEN THOUSAND FOR
THE ATTENTIONS YOUR HEART WILL DICTATE TOWARDS HER.--IF YOU THINK ME IN
A WAY TO BE HAPPIER THAN I DESERVE, I AM QUITE OF YOUR OPINION.--MISS
W. CALLS ME THE CHILD OF GOOD FORTUNE. I HOPE SHE IS RIGHT.--IN ONE
RESPECT, MY GOOD FORTUNE IS UNDOUBTED, THAT OF BEING ABLE TO SUBSCRIBE
MYSELF,

                    YOUR OBLIGED AND AFFECTIONATE SON,

                                          F. C. WESTON CHURCHILL.



CHAPTER XV


THIS LETTER MUST MAKE ITS WAY TO EMMA'S FEELINGS. SHE WAS OBLIGED, IN
SPITE OF HER PREVIOUS DETERMINATION TO THE CONTRARY, TO DO IT ALL THE
JUSTICE THAT MRS. WESTON FORETOLD. AS SOON AS SHE CAME TO HER OWN NAME,
IT WAS IRRESISTIBLE; EVERY LINE RELATING TO HERSELF WAS INTERESTING,
AND ALMOST EVERY LINE AGREEABLE; AND WHEN THIS CHARM CEASED, THE SUBJECT
COULD STILL MAINTAIN ITSELF, BY THE NATURAL RETURN OF HER FORMER REGARD
FOR THE WRITER, AND THE VERY STRONG ATTRACTION WHICH ANY PICTURE OF
LOVE MUST HAVE FOR HER AT THAT MOMENT. SHE NEVER STOPT TILL SHE HAD GONE
THROUGH THE WHOLE; AND THOUGH IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO FEEL THAT HE HAD
BEEN WRONG, YET HE HAD BEEN LESS WRONG THAN SHE HAD SUPPOSED--AND HE HAD
SUFFERED, AND WAS VERY SORRY--AND HE WAS SO GRATEFUL TO MRS. WESTON, AND
SO MUCH IN LOVE WITH MISS FAIRFAX, AND SHE WAS SO HAPPY HERSELF, THAT
THERE WAS NO BEING SEVERE; AND COULD HE HAVE ENTERED THE ROOM, SHE MUST
HAVE SHAKEN HANDS WITH HIM AS HEARTILY AS EVER.

SHE THOUGHT SO WELL OF THE LETTER, THAT WHEN MR. KNIGHTLEY CAME AGAIN,
SHE DESIRED HIM TO READ IT. SHE WAS SURE OF MRS. WESTON'S WISHING IT TO
BE COMMUNICATED; ESPECIALLY TO ONE, WHO, LIKE MR. KNIGHTLEY, HAD SEEN SO
MUCH TO BLAME IN HIS CONDUCT.

"I SHALL BE VERY GLAD TO LOOK IT OVER," SAID HE; "BUT IT SEEMS LONG. I
WILL TAKE IT HOME WITH ME AT NIGHT."

BUT THAT WOULD NOT DO. MR. WESTON WAS TO CALL IN THE EVENING, AND SHE
MUST RETURN IT BY HIM.

"I WOULD RATHER BE TALKING TO YOU," HE REPLIED; "BUT AS IT SEEMS A
MATTER OF JUSTICE, IT SHALL BE DONE."

HE BEGAN--STOPPING, HOWEVER, ALMOST DIRECTLY TO SAY, "HAD I BEEN OFFERED
THE SIGHT OF ONE OF THIS GENTLEMAN'S LETTERS TO HIS MOTHER-IN-LAW A FEW
MONTHS AGO, EMMA, IT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN TAKEN WITH SUCH INDIFFERENCE."

HE PROCEEDED A LITTLE FARTHER, READING TO HIMSELF; AND THEN, WITH A
SMILE, OBSERVED, "HUMPH! A FINE COMPLIMENTARY OPENING: BUT IT IS HIS
WAY. ONE MAN'S STYLE MUST NOT BE THE RULE OF ANOTHER'S. WE WILL NOT BE
SEVERE."

"IT WILL BE NATURAL FOR ME," HE ADDED SHORTLY AFTERWARDS, "TO SPEAK MY
OPINION ALOUD AS I READ. BY DOING IT, I SHALL FEEL THAT I AM NEAR YOU.
IT WILL NOT BE SO GREAT A LOSS OF TIME: BUT IF YOU DISLIKE IT--"

"NOT AT ALL. I SHOULD WISH IT."

MR. KNIGHTLEY RETURNED TO HIS READING WITH GREATER ALACRITY.

"HE TRIFLES HERE," SAID HE, "AS TO THE TEMPTATION. HE KNOWS HE IS WRONG,
AND HAS NOTHING RATIONAL TO URGE.--BAD.--HE OUGHT NOT TO HAVE FORMED THE
ENGAGEMENT.--'HIS FATHER'S DISPOSITION:'--HE IS UNJUST, HOWEVER, TO HIS
FATHER. MR. WESTON'S SANGUINE TEMPER WAS A BLESSING ON ALL HIS UPRIGHT
AND HONOURABLE EXERTIONS; BUT MR. WESTON EARNED EVERY PRESENT COMFORT
BEFORE HE ENDEAVOURED TO GAIN IT.--VERY TRUE; HE DID NOT COME TILL MISS
FAIRFAX WAS HERE."

"AND I HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN," SAID EMMA, "HOW SURE YOU WERE THAT HE MIGHT
HAVE COME SOONER IF HE WOULD. YOU PASS IT OVER VERY HANDSOMELY--BUT YOU
WERE PERFECTLY RIGHT."

"I WAS NOT QUITE IMPARTIAL IN MY JUDGMENT, EMMA:--BUT YET, I THINK--HAD
YOU NOT BEEN IN THE CASE--I SHOULD STILL HAVE DISTRUSTED HIM."

WHEN HE CAME TO MISS WOODHOUSE, HE WAS OBLIGED TO READ THE WHOLE OF IT
ALOUD--ALL THAT RELATED TO HER, WITH A SMILE; A LOOK; A SHAKE OF THE
HEAD; A WORD OR TWO OF ASSENT, OR DISAPPROBATION; OR MERELY OF LOVE, AS
THE SUBJECT REQUIRED; CONCLUDING, HOWEVER, SERIOUSLY, AND, AFTER STEADY
REFLECTION, THUS--

"VERY BAD--THOUGH IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN WORSE.--PLAYING A MOST DANGEROUS
GAME. TOO MUCH INDEBTED TO THE EVENT FOR HIS ACQUITTAL.--NO JUDGE OF
HIS OWN MANNERS BY YOU.--ALWAYS DECEIVED IN FACT BY HIS OWN WISHES, AND
REGARDLESS OF LITTLE BESIDES HIS OWN CONVENIENCE.--FANCYING YOU TO HAVE
FATHOMED HIS SECRET. NATURAL ENOUGH!--HIS OWN MIND FULL OF INTRIGUE,
THAT HE SHOULD SUSPECT IT IN OTHERS.--MYSTERY; FINESSE--HOW THEY PERVERT
THE UNDERSTANDING! MY EMMA, DOES NOT EVERY THING SERVE TO PROVE MORE
AND MORE THE BEAUTY OF TRUTH AND SINCERITY IN ALL OUR DEALINGS WITH EACH
OTHER?"

EMMA AGREED TO IT, AND WITH A BLUSH OF SENSIBILITY ON HARRIET'S ACCOUNT,
WHICH SHE COULD NOT GIVE ANY SINCERE EXPLANATION OF.

"YOU HAD BETTER GO ON," SAID SHE.

HE DID SO, BUT VERY SOON STOPT AGAIN TO SAY, "THE PIANOFORTE! AH! THAT
WAS THE ACT OF A VERY, VERY YOUNG MAN, ONE TOO YOUNG TO CONSIDER WHETHER
THE INCONVENIENCE OF IT MIGHT NOT VERY MUCH EXCEED THE PLEASURE. A
BOYISH SCHEME, INDEED!--I CANNOT COMPREHEND A MAN'S WISHING TO GIVE A
WOMAN ANY PROOF OF AFFECTION WHICH HE KNOWS SHE WOULD RATHER DISPENSE
WITH; AND HE DID KNOW THAT SHE WOULD HAVE PREVENTED THE INSTRUMENT'S
COMING IF SHE COULD."

AFTER THIS, HE MADE SOME PROGRESS WITHOUT ANY PAUSE. FRANK CHURCHILL'S
CONFESSION OF HAVING BEHAVED SHAMEFULLY WAS THE FIRST THING TO CALL FOR
MORE THAN A WORD IN PASSING.

"I PERFECTLY AGREE WITH YOU, SIR,"--WAS THEN HIS REMARK. "YOU DID BEHAVE
VERY SHAMEFULLY. YOU NEVER WROTE A TRUER LINE." AND HAVING GONE THROUGH
WHAT IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED OF THE BASIS OF THEIR DISAGREEMENT, AND HIS
PERSISTING TO ACT IN DIRECT OPPOSITION TO JANE FAIRFAX'S SENSE OF RIGHT,
HE MADE A FULLER PAUSE TO SAY, "THIS IS VERY BAD.--HE HAD INDUCED HER
TO PLACE HERSELF, FOR HIS SAKE, IN A SITUATION OF EXTREME DIFFICULTY AND
UNEASINESS, AND IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN HIS FIRST OBJECT TO PREVENT HER FROM
SUFFERING UNNECESSARILY.--SHE MUST HAVE HAD MUCH MORE TO CONTEND
WITH, IN CARRYING ON THE CORRESPONDENCE, THAN HE COULD. HE SHOULD HAVE
RESPECTED EVEN UNREASONABLE SCRUPLES, HAD THERE BEEN SUCH; BUT HERS WERE
ALL REASONABLE. WE MUST LOOK TO HER ONE FAULT, AND REMEMBER THAT SHE
HAD DONE A WRONG THING IN CONSENTING TO THE ENGAGEMENT, TO BEAR THAT SHE
SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN SUCH A STATE OF PUNISHMENT."

EMMA KNEW THAT HE WAS NOW GETTING TO THE BOX HILL PARTY, AND GREW
UNCOMFORTABLE. HER OWN BEHAVIOUR HAD BEEN SO VERY IMPROPER! SHE WAS
DEEPLY ASHAMED, AND A LITTLE AFRAID OF HIS NEXT LOOK. IT WAS ALL READ,
HOWEVER, STEADILY, ATTENTIVELY, AND WITHOUT THE SMALLEST REMARK; AND,
EXCEPTING ONE MOMENTARY GLANCE AT HER, INSTANTLY WITHDRAWN, IN THE FEAR
OF GIVING PAIN--NO REMEMBRANCE OF BOX HILL SEEMED TO EXIST.

"THERE IS NO SAYING MUCH FOR THE DELICACY OF OUR GOOD FRIENDS, THE
ELTONS," WAS HIS NEXT OBSERVATION.--"HIS FEELINGS ARE NATURAL.--WHAT!
ACTUALLY RESOLVE TO BREAK WITH HIM ENTIRELY!--SHE FELT THE ENGAGEMENT TO
BE A SOURCE OF REPENTANCE AND MISERY TO EACH--SHE DISSOLVED IT.--WHAT A
VIEW THIS GIVES OF HER SENSE OF HIS BEHAVIOUR!--WELL, HE MUST BE A MOST
EXTRAORDINARY--"

"NAY, NAY, READ ON.--YOU WILL FIND HOW VERY MUCH HE SUFFERS."

"I HOPE HE DOES," REPLIED MR. KNIGHTLEY COOLLY, AND RESUMING THE LETTER.
"'SMALLRIDGE!'--WHAT DOES THIS MEAN? WHAT IS ALL THIS?"

"SHE HAD ENGAGED TO GO AS GOVERNESS TO MRS. SMALLRIDGE'S CHILDREN--A
DEAR FRIEND OF MRS. ELTON'S--A NEIGHBOUR OF MAPLE GROVE; AND, BY THE
BYE, I WONDER HOW MRS. ELTON BEARS THE DISAPPOINTMENT?"

"SAY NOTHING, MY DEAR EMMA, WHILE YOU OBLIGE ME TO READ--NOT EVEN OF
MRS. ELTON. ONLY ONE PAGE MORE. I SHALL SOON HAVE DONE. WHAT A LETTER
THE MAN WRITES!"

"I WISH YOU WOULD READ IT WITH A KINDER SPIRIT TOWARDS HIM."

"WELL, THERE IS FEELING HERE.--HE DOES SEEM TO HAVE SUFFERED IN
FINDING HER ILL.--CERTAINLY, I CAN HAVE NO DOUBT OF HIS BEING FOND OF
HER. 'DEARER, MUCH DEARER THAN EVER.' I HOPE HE MAY LONG CONTINUE TO
FEEL ALL THE VALUE OF SUCH A RECONCILIATION.--HE IS A VERY LIBERAL
THANKER, WITH HIS THOUSANDS AND TENS OF THOUSANDS.--'HAPPIER THAN I
DESERVE.' COME, HE KNOWS HIMSELF THERE. 'MISS WOODHOUSE CALLS ME THE
CHILD OF GOOD FORTUNE.'--THOSE WERE MISS WOODHOUSE'S WORDS, WERE THEY?--
AND A FINE ENDING--AND THERE IS THE LETTER. THE CHILD OF GOOD FORTUNE!
THAT WAS YOUR NAME FOR HIM, WAS IT?"

"YOU DO NOT APPEAR SO WELL SATISFIED WITH HIS LETTER AS I AM; BUT STILL
YOU MUST, AT LEAST I HOPE YOU MUST, THINK THE BETTER OF HIM FOR IT. I
HOPE IT DOES HIM SOME SERVICE WITH YOU."

"YES, CERTAINLY IT DOES. HE HAS HAD GREAT FAULTS, FAULTS OF
INCONSIDERATION AND THOUGHTLESSNESS; AND I AM VERY MUCH OF HIS OPINION
IN THINKING HIM LIKELY TO BE HAPPIER THAN HE DESERVES: BUT STILL AS HE
IS, BEYOND A DOUBT, REALLY ATTACHED TO MISS FAIRFAX, AND WILL SOON, IT
MAY BE HOPED, HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF BEING CONSTANTLY WITH HER, I AM VERY
READY TO BELIEVE HIS CHARACTER WILL IMPROVE, AND ACQUIRE FROM HERS THE
STEADINESS AND DELICACY OF PRINCIPLE THAT IT WANTS. AND NOW, LET ME TALK
TO YOU OF SOMETHING ELSE. I HAVE ANOTHER PERSON'S INTEREST AT PRESENT
SO MUCH AT HEART, THAT I CANNOT THINK ANY LONGER ABOUT FRANK CHURCHILL.
EVER SINCE I LEFT YOU THIS MORNING, EMMA, MY MIND HAS BEEN HARD AT WORK
ON ONE SUBJECT."

THE SUBJECT FOLLOWED; IT WAS IN PLAIN, UNAFFECTED, GENTLEMANLIKE
ENGLISH, SUCH AS MR. KNIGHTLEY USED EVEN TO THE WOMAN HE WAS IN LOVE
WITH, HOW TO BE ABLE TO ASK HER TO MARRY HIM, WITHOUT ATTACKING THE
HAPPINESS OF HER FATHER. EMMA'S ANSWER WAS READY AT THE FIRST WORD.
"WHILE HER DEAR FATHER LIVED, ANY CHANGE OF CONDITION MUST BE IMPOSSIBLE
FOR HER. SHE COULD NEVER QUIT HIM." PART ONLY OF THIS ANSWER, HOWEVER,
WAS ADMITTED. THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF HER QUITTING HER FATHER, MR.
KNIGHTLEY FELT AS STRONGLY AS HERSELF; BUT THE INADMISSIBILITY OF ANY
OTHER CHANGE, HE COULD NOT AGREE TO. HE HAD BEEN THINKING IT OVER MOST
DEEPLY, MOST INTENTLY; HE HAD AT FIRST HOPED TO INDUCE MR. WOODHOUSE TO
REMOVE WITH HER TO DONWELL; HE HAD WANTED TO BELIEVE IT FEASIBLE, BUT
HIS KNOWLEDGE OF MR. WOODHOUSE WOULD NOT SUFFER HIM TO DECEIVE HIMSELF
LONG; AND NOW HE CONFESSED HIS PERSUASION, THAT SUCH A TRANSPLANTATION
WOULD BE A RISK OF HER FATHER'S COMFORT, PERHAPS EVEN OF HIS LIFE, WHICH
MUST NOT BE HAZARDED. MR. WOODHOUSE TAKEN FROM HARTFIELD!--NO, HE FELT
THAT IT OUGHT NOT TO BE ATTEMPTED. BUT THE PLAN WHICH HAD ARISEN ON THE
SACRIFICE OF THIS, HE TRUSTED HIS DEAREST EMMA WOULD NOT FIND IN ANY
RESPECT OBJECTIONABLE; IT WAS, THAT HE SHOULD BE RECEIVED AT HARTFIELD;
THAT SO LONG AS HER FATHER'S HAPPINESS IN OTHER WORDS HIS LIFE--REQUIRED
HARTFIELD TO CONTINUE HER HOME, IT SHOULD BE HIS LIKEWISE.

OF THEIR ALL REMOVING TO DONWELL, EMMA HAD ALREADY HAD HER OWN PASSING
THOUGHTS. LIKE HIM, SHE HAD TRIED THE SCHEME AND REJECTED IT; BUT SUCH
AN ALTERNATIVE AS THIS HAD NOT OCCURRED TO HER. SHE WAS SENSIBLE OF ALL
THE AFFECTION IT EVINCED. SHE FELT THAT, IN QUITTING DONWELL, HE MUST
BE SACRIFICING A GREAT DEAL OF INDEPENDENCE OF HOURS AND HABITS; THAT
IN LIVING CONSTANTLY WITH HER FATHER, AND IN NO HOUSE OF HIS OWN, THERE
WOULD BE MUCH, VERY MUCH, TO BE BORNE WITH. SHE PROMISED TO THINK OF IT,
AND ADVISED HIM TO THINK OF IT MORE; BUT HE WAS FULLY CONVINCED, THAT NO
REFLECTION COULD ALTER HIS WISHES OR HIS OPINION ON THE SUBJECT. HE HAD
GIVEN IT, HE COULD ASSURE HER, VERY LONG AND CALM CONSIDERATION; HE HAD
BEEN WALKING AWAY FROM WILLIAM LARKINS THE WHOLE MORNING, TO HAVE HIS
THOUGHTS TO HIMSELF.

"AH! THERE IS ONE DIFFICULTY UNPROVIDED FOR," CRIED EMMA. "I AM SURE
WILLIAM LARKINS WILL NOT LIKE IT. YOU MUST GET HIS CONSENT BEFORE YOU
ASK MINE."

SHE PROMISED, HOWEVER, TO THINK OF IT; AND PRETTY NEARLY PROMISED,
MOREOVER, TO THINK OF IT, WITH THE INTENTION OF FINDING IT A VERY GOOD
SCHEME.

IT IS REMARKABLE, THAT EMMA, IN THE MANY, VERY MANY, POINTS OF VIEW IN
WHICH SHE WAS NOW BEGINNING TO CONSIDER DONWELL ABBEY, WAS NEVER
STRUCK WITH ANY SENSE OF INJURY TO HER NEPHEW HENRY, WHOSE RIGHTS AS
HEIR-EXPECTANT HAD FORMERLY BEEN SO TENACIOUSLY REGARDED. THINK SHE MUST
OF THE POSSIBLE DIFFERENCE TO THE POOR LITTLE BOY; AND YET SHE ONLY
GAVE HERSELF A SAUCY CONSCIOUS SMILE ABOUT IT, AND FOUND AMUSEMENT IN
DETECTING THE REAL CAUSE OF THAT VIOLENT DISLIKE OF MR. KNIGHTLEY'S
MARRYING JANE FAIRFAX, OR ANY BODY ELSE, WHICH AT THE TIME SHE HAD
WHOLLY IMPUTED TO THE AMIABLE SOLICITUDE OF THE SISTER AND THE AUNT.

THIS PROPOSAL OF HIS, THIS PLAN OF MARRYING AND CONTINUING AT
HARTFIELD--THE MORE SHE CONTEMPLATED IT, THE MORE PLEASING IT BECAME.
HIS EVILS SEEMED TO LESSEN, HER OWN ADVANTAGES TO INCREASE, THEIR MUTUAL
GOOD TO OUTWEIGH EVERY DRAWBACK. SUCH A COMPANION FOR HERSELF IN THE
PERIODS OF ANXIETY AND CHEERLESSNESS BEFORE HER!--SUCH A PARTNER IN
ALL THOSE DUTIES AND CARES TO WHICH TIME MUST BE GIVING INCREASE OF
MELANCHOLY!

SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN TOO HAPPY BUT FOR POOR HARRIET; BUT EVERY BLESSING
OF HER OWN SEEMED TO INVOLVE AND ADVANCE THE SUFFERINGS OF HER FRIEND,
WHO MUST NOW BE EVEN EXCLUDED FROM HARTFIELD. THE DELIGHTFUL FAMILY
PARTY WHICH EMMA WAS SECURING FOR HERSELF, POOR HARRIET MUST, IN MERE
CHARITABLE CAUTION, BE KEPT AT A DISTANCE FROM. SHE WOULD BE A LOSER IN
EVERY WAY. EMMA COULD NOT DEPLORE HER FUTURE ABSENCE AS ANY DEDUCTION
FROM HER OWN ENJOYMENT. IN SUCH A PARTY, HARRIET WOULD BE RATHER A
DEAD WEIGHT THAN OTHERWISE; BUT FOR THE POOR GIRL HERSELF, IT SEEMED A
PECULIARLY CRUEL NECESSITY THAT WAS TO BE PLACING HER IN SUCH A STATE OF
UNMERITED PUNISHMENT.

IN TIME, OF COURSE, MR. KNIGHTLEY WOULD BE FORGOTTEN, THAT IS,
SUPPLANTED; BUT THIS COULD NOT BE EXPECTED TO HAPPEN VERY EARLY. MR.
KNIGHTLEY HIMSELF WOULD BE DOING NOTHING TO ASSIST THE CURE;--NOT
LIKE MR. ELTON. MR. KNIGHTLEY, ALWAYS SO KIND, SO FEELING, SO TRULY
CONSIDERATE FOR EVERY BODY, WOULD NEVER DESERVE TO BE LESS WORSHIPPED
THAN NOW; AND IT REALLY WAS TOO MUCH TO HOPE EVEN OF HARRIET, THAT SHE
COULD BE IN LOVE WITH MORE THAN THREE MEN IN ONE YEAR.



CHAPTER XVI


IT WAS A VERY GREAT RELIEF TO EMMA TO FIND HARRIET AS DESIROUS AS
HERSELF TO AVOID A MEETING. THEIR INTERCOURSE WAS PAINFUL ENOUGH BY
LETTER. HOW MUCH WORSE, HAD THEY BEEN OBLIGED TO MEET!

HARRIET EXPRESSED HERSELF VERY MUCH AS MIGHT BE SUPPOSED, WITHOUT
REPROACHES, OR APPARENT SENSE OF ILL-USAGE; AND YET EMMA FANCIED THERE
WAS A SOMETHING OF RESENTMENT, A SOMETHING BORDERING ON IT IN HER STYLE,
WHICH INCREASED THE DESIRABLENESS OF THEIR BEING SEPARATE.--IT MIGHT BE
ONLY HER OWN CONSCIOUSNESS; BUT IT SEEMED AS IF AN ANGEL ONLY COULD HAVE
BEEN QUITE WITHOUT RESENTMENT UNDER SUCH A STROKE.

SHE HAD NO DIFFICULTY IN PROCURING ISABELLA'S INVITATION; AND SHE WAS
FORTUNATE IN HAVING A SUFFICIENT REASON FOR ASKING IT, WITHOUT RESORTING
TO INVENTION.--THERE WAS A TOOTH AMISS. HARRIET REALLY WISHED, AND
HAD WISHED SOME TIME, TO CONSULT A DENTIST. MRS. JOHN KNIGHTLEY WAS
DELIGHTED TO BE OF USE; ANY THING OF ILL HEALTH WAS A RECOMMENDATION TO
HER--AND THOUGH NOT SO FOND OF A DENTIST AS OF A MR. WINGFIELD, SHE WAS
QUITE EAGER TO HAVE HARRIET UNDER HER CARE.--WHEN IT WAS THUS SETTLED
ON HER SISTER'S SIDE, EMMA PROPOSED IT TO HER FRIEND, AND FOUND HER
VERY PERSUADABLE.--HARRIET WAS TO GO; SHE WAS INVITED FOR AT LEAST A
FORTNIGHT; SHE WAS TO BE CONVEYED IN MR. WOODHOUSE'S CARRIAGE.--IT WAS
ALL ARRANGED, IT WAS ALL COMPLETED, AND HARRIET WAS SAFE IN BRUNSWICK
SQUARE.

NOW EMMA COULD, INDEED, ENJOY MR. KNIGHTLEY'S VISITS; NOW SHE COULD
TALK, AND SHE COULD LISTEN WITH TRUE HAPPINESS, UNCHECKED BY THAT SENSE
OF INJUSTICE, OF GUILT, OF SOMETHING MOST PAINFUL, WHICH HAD HAUNTED HER
WHEN REMEMBERING HOW DISAPPOINTED A HEART WAS NEAR HER, HOW MUCH MIGHT
AT THAT MOMENT, AND AT A LITTLE DISTANCE, BE ENDURING BY THE FEELINGS
WHICH SHE HAD LED ASTRAY HERSELF.

THE DIFFERENCE OF HARRIET AT MRS. GODDARD'S, OR IN LONDON, MADE PERHAPS
AN UNREASONABLE DIFFERENCE IN EMMA'S SENSATIONS; BUT SHE COULD NOT THINK
OF HER IN LONDON WITHOUT OBJECTS OF CURIOSITY AND EMPLOYMENT, WHICH MUST
BE AVERTING THE PAST, AND CARRYING HER OUT OF HERSELF.

SHE WOULD NOT ALLOW ANY OTHER ANXIETY TO SUCCEED DIRECTLY TO THE PLACE
IN HER MIND WHICH HARRIET HAD OCCUPIED. THERE WAS A COMMUNICATION BEFORE
HER, ONE WHICH SHE ONLY COULD BE COMPETENT TO MAKE--THE CONFESSION OF
HER ENGAGEMENT TO HER FATHER; BUT SHE WOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH IT
AT PRESENT.--SHE HAD RESOLVED TO DEFER THE DISCLOSURE TILL MRS. WESTON
WERE SAFE AND WELL. NO ADDITIONAL AGITATION SHOULD BE THROWN AT THIS
PERIOD AMONG THOSE SHE LOVED--AND THE EVIL SHOULD NOT ACT ON HERSELF
BY ANTICIPATION BEFORE THE APPOINTED TIME.--A FORTNIGHT, AT LEAST, OF
LEISURE AND PEACE OF MIND, TO CROWN EVERY WARMER, BUT MORE AGITATING,
DELIGHT, SHOULD BE HERS.

SHE SOON RESOLVED, EQUALLY AS A DUTY AND A PLEASURE, TO EMPLOY HALF AN
HOUR OF THIS HOLIDAY OF SPIRITS IN CALLING ON MISS FAIRFAX.--SHE OUGHT
TO GO--AND SHE WAS LONGING TO SEE HER; THE RESEMBLANCE OF THEIR PRESENT
SITUATIONS INCREASING EVERY OTHER MOTIVE OF GOODWILL. IT WOULD BE A
SECRET SATISFACTION; BUT THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF A SIMILARITY OF PROSPECT
WOULD CERTAINLY ADD TO THE INTEREST WITH WHICH SHE SHOULD ATTEND TO ANY
THING JANE MIGHT COMMUNICATE.

SHE WENT--SHE HAD DRIVEN ONCE UNSUCCESSFULLY TO THE DOOR, BUT HAD NOT
BEEN INTO THE HOUSE SINCE THE MORNING AFTER BOX HILL, WHEN POOR JANE HAD
BEEN IN SUCH DISTRESS AS HAD FILLED HER WITH COMPASSION, THOUGH ALL THE
WORST OF HER SUFFERINGS HAD BEEN UNSUSPECTED.--THE FEAR OF BEING STILL
UNWELCOME, DETERMINED HER, THOUGH ASSURED OF THEIR BEING AT HOME, TO
WAIT IN THE PASSAGE, AND SEND UP HER NAME.--SHE HEARD PATTY ANNOUNCING
IT; BUT NO SUCH BUSTLE SUCCEEDED AS POOR MISS BATES HAD BEFORE MADE SO
HAPPILY INTELLIGIBLE.--NO; SHE HEARD NOTHING BUT THE INSTANT REPLY OF,
"BEG HER TO WALK UP;"--AND A MOMENT AFTERWARDS SHE WAS MET ON THE STAIRS
BY JANE HERSELF, COMING EAGERLY FORWARD, AS IF NO OTHER RECEPTION OF HER
WERE FELT SUFFICIENT.--EMMA HAD NEVER SEEN HER LOOK SO WELL, SO LOVELY,
SO ENGAGING. THERE WAS CONSCIOUSNESS, ANIMATION, AND WARMTH; THERE WAS
EVERY THING WHICH HER COUNTENANCE OR MANNER COULD EVER HAVE WANTED.--
SHE CAME FORWARD WITH AN OFFERED HAND; AND SAID, IN A LOW, BUT VERY
FEELING TONE,

"THIS IS MOST KIND, INDEED!--MISS WOODHOUSE, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME
TO EXPRESS--I HOPE YOU WILL BELIEVE--EXCUSE ME FOR BEING SO ENTIRELY
WITHOUT WORDS."

EMMA WAS GRATIFIED, AND WOULD SOON HAVE SHEWN NO WANT OF WORDS, IF THE
SOUND OF MRS. ELTON'S VOICE FROM THE SITTING-ROOM HAD NOT CHECKED
HER, AND MADE IT EXPEDIENT TO COMPRESS ALL HER FRIENDLY AND ALL HER
CONGRATULATORY SENSATIONS INTO A VERY, VERY EARNEST SHAKE OF THE HAND.

MRS. BATES AND MRS. ELTON WERE TOGETHER. MISS BATES WAS OUT, WHICH
ACCOUNTED FOR THE PREVIOUS TRANQUILLITY. EMMA COULD HAVE WISHED MRS.
ELTON ELSEWHERE; BUT SHE WAS IN A HUMOUR TO HAVE PATIENCE WITH EVERY
BODY; AND AS MRS. ELTON MET HER WITH UNUSUAL GRACIOUSNESS, SHE HOPED THE
RENCONTRE WOULD DO THEM NO HARM.

SHE SOON BELIEVED HERSELF TO PENETRATE MRS. ELTON'S THOUGHTS, AND
UNDERSTAND WHY SHE WAS, LIKE HERSELF, IN HAPPY SPIRITS; IT WAS BEING IN
MISS FAIRFAX'S CONFIDENCE, AND FANCYING HERSELF ACQUAINTED WITH WHAT WAS
STILL A SECRET TO OTHER PEOPLE. EMMA SAW SYMPTOMS OF IT IMMEDIATELY IN
THE EXPRESSION OF HER FACE; AND WHILE PAYING HER OWN COMPLIMENTS TO MRS.
BATES, AND APPEARING TO ATTEND TO THE GOOD OLD LADY'S REPLIES, SHE SAW
HER WITH A SORT OF ANXIOUS PARADE OF MYSTERY FOLD UP A LETTER WHICH SHE
HAD APPARENTLY BEEN READING ALOUD TO MISS FAIRFAX, AND RETURN IT INTO
THE PURPLE AND GOLD RETICULE BY HER SIDE, SAYING, WITH SIGNIFICANT NODS,

"WE CAN FINISH THIS SOME OTHER TIME, YOU KNOW. YOU AND I SHALL NOT WANT
OPPORTUNITIES. AND, IN FACT, YOU HAVE HEARD ALL THE ESSENTIAL ALREADY. I
ONLY WANTED TO PROVE TO YOU THAT MRS. S. ADMITS OUR APOLOGY, AND IS
NOT OFFENDED. YOU SEE HOW DELIGHTFULLY SHE WRITES. OH! SHE IS A SWEET
CREATURE! YOU WOULD HAVE DOATED ON HER, HAD YOU GONE.--BUT NOT A WORD
MORE. LET US BE DISCREET--QUITE ON OUR GOOD BEHAVIOUR.--HUSH!--YOU
REMEMBER THOSE LINES--I FORGET THE POEM AT THIS MOMENT:

        "FOR WHEN A LADY'S IN THE CASE,
        "YOU KNOW ALL OTHER THINGS GIVE PLACE."

NOW I SAY, MY DEAR, IN OUR CASE, FOR LADY, READ----MUM! A WORD TO
THE WISE.--I AM IN A FINE FLOW OF SPIRITS, AN'T I? BUT I WANT TO SET
YOUR HEART AT EASE AS TO MRS. S.--MY REPRESENTATION, YOU SEE, HAS
QUITE APPEASED HER."

AND AGAIN, ON EMMA'S MERELY TURNING HER HEAD TO LOOK AT MRS. BATES'S
KNITTING, SHE ADDED, IN A HALF WHISPER,

"I MENTIONED NO NAMES, YOU WILL OBSERVE.--OH! NO; CAUTIOUS AS A
MINISTER OF STATE. I MANAGED IT EXTREMELY WELL."

EMMA COULD NOT DOUBT. IT WAS A PALPABLE DISPLAY, REPEATED ON EVERY
POSSIBLE OCCASION. WHEN THEY HAD ALL TALKED A LITTLE WHILE IN HARMONY OF
THE WEATHER AND MRS. WESTON, SHE FOUND HERSELF ABRUPTLY ADDRESSED WITH,

"DO NOT YOU THINK, MISS WOODHOUSE, OUR SAUCY LITTLE FRIEND HERE IS
CHARMINGLY RECOVERED?--DO NOT YOU THINK HER CURE DOES PERRY THE HIGHEST
CREDIT?--(HERE WAS A SIDE-GLANCE OF GREAT MEANING AT JANE.) UPON MY
WORD, PERRY HAS RESTORED HER IN A WONDERFUL SHORT TIME!--OH! IF YOU HAD
SEEN HER, AS I DID, WHEN SHE WAS AT THE WORST!"--AND WHEN MRS. BATES
WAS SAYING SOMETHING TO EMMA, WHISPERED FARTHER, "WE DO NOT SAY A WORD
OF ANY ASSISTANCE THAT PERRY MIGHT HAVE; NOT A WORD OF A CERTAIN YOUNG
PHYSICIAN FROM WINDSOR.--OH! NO; PERRY SHALL HAVE ALL THE CREDIT."

"I HAVE SCARCE HAD THE PLEASURE OF SEEING YOU, MISS WOODHOUSE," SHE
SHORTLY AFTERWARDS BEGAN, "SINCE THE PARTY TO BOX HILL. VERY PLEASANT
PARTY. BUT YET I THINK THERE WAS SOMETHING WANTING. THINGS DID NOT
SEEM--THAT IS, THERE SEEMED A LITTLE CLOUD UPON THE SPIRITS OF SOME.--SO
IT APPEARED TO ME AT LEAST, BUT I MIGHT BE MISTAKEN. HOWEVER, I THINK
IT ANSWERED SO FAR AS TO TEMPT ONE TO GO AGAIN. WHAT SAY YOU BOTH TO OUR
COLLECTING THE SAME PARTY, AND EXPLORING TO BOX HILL AGAIN, WHILE THE
FINE WEATHER LASTS?--IT MUST BE THE SAME PARTY, YOU KNOW, QUITE THE
SAME PARTY, NOT ONE EXCEPTION."

SOON AFTER THIS MISS BATES CAME IN, AND EMMA COULD NOT HELP BEING
DIVERTED BY THE PERPLEXITY OF HER FIRST ANSWER TO HERSELF, RESULTING,
SHE SUPPOSED, FROM DOUBT OF WHAT MIGHT BE SAID, AND IMPATIENCE TO SAY
EVERY THING.

"THANK YOU, DEAR MISS WOODHOUSE, YOU ARE ALL KINDNESS.--IT IS IMPOSSIBLE
TO SAY--YES, INDEED, I QUITE UNDERSTAND--DEAREST JANE'S PROSPECTS--THAT
IS, I DO NOT MEAN.--BUT SHE IS CHARMINGLY RECOVERED.--HOW IS MR.
WOODHOUSE?--I AM SO GLAD.--QUITE OUT OF MY POWER.--SUCH A HAPPY LITTLE
CIRCLE AS YOU FIND US HERE.--YES, INDEED.--CHARMING YOUNG MAN!--THAT
IS--SO VERY FRIENDLY; I MEAN GOOD MR. PERRY!--SUCH ATTENTION TO
JANE!"--AND FROM HER GREAT, HER MORE THAN COMMONLY THANKFUL DELIGHT
TOWARDS MRS. ELTON FOR BEING THERE, EMMA GUESSED THAT THERE HAD BEEN A
LITTLE SHOW OF RESENTMENT TOWARDS JANE, FROM THE VICARAGE QUARTER,
WHICH WAS NOW GRACIOUSLY OVERCOME.--AFTER A FEW WHISPERS, INDEED, WHICH
PLACED IT BEYOND A GUESS, MRS. ELTON, SPEAKING LOUDER, SAID,

"YES, HERE I AM, MY GOOD FRIEND; AND HERE I HAVE BEEN SO LONG, THAT
ANYWHERE ELSE I SHOULD THINK IT NECESSARY TO APOLOGISE; BUT, THE TRUTH
IS, THAT I AM WAITING FOR MY LORD AND MASTER. HE PROMISED TO JOIN ME
HERE, AND PAY HIS RESPECTS TO YOU."

"WHAT! ARE WE TO HAVE THE PLEASURE OF A CALL FROM MR. ELTON?--THAT WILL
BE A FAVOUR INDEED! FOR I KNOW GENTLEMEN DO NOT LIKE MORNING VISITS, AND
MR. ELTON'S TIME IS SO ENGAGED."

"UPON MY WORD IT IS, MISS BATES.--HE REALLY IS ENGAGED FROM MORNING TO
NIGHT.--THERE IS NO END OF PEOPLE'S COMING TO HIM, ON SOME PRETENCE OR
OTHER.--THE MAGISTRATES, AND OVERSEERS, AND CHURCHWARDENS, ARE ALWAYS
WANTING HIS OPINION. THEY SEEM NOT ABLE TO DO ANY THING WITHOUT
HIM.--'UPON MY WORD, MR. E.,' I OFTEN SAY, 'RATHER YOU THAN I.--I DO
NOT KNOW WHAT WOULD BECOME OF MY CRAYONS AND MY INSTRUMENT, IF I HAD
HALF SO MANY APPLICANTS.'--BAD ENOUGH AS IT IS, FOR I ABSOLUTELY NEGLECT
THEM BOTH TO AN UNPARDONABLE DEGREE.--I BELIEVE I HAVE NOT PLAYED A BAR
THIS FORTNIGHT.--HOWEVER, HE IS COMING, I ASSURE YOU: YES, INDEED, ON
PURPOSE TO WAIT ON YOU ALL." AND PUTTING UP HER HAND TO SCREEN HER
WORDS FROM EMMA--"A CONGRATULATORY VISIT, YOU KNOW.--OH! YES, QUITE
INDISPENSABLE."

MISS BATES LOOKED ABOUT HER, SO HAPPILY--!

"HE PROMISED TO COME TO ME AS SOON AS HE COULD DISENGAGE HIMSELF
FROM KNIGHTLEY; BUT HE AND KNIGHTLEY ARE SHUT UP TOGETHER IN DEEP
CONSULTATION.--MR. E. IS KNIGHTLEY'S RIGHT HAND."

EMMA WOULD NOT HAVE SMILED FOR THE WORLD, AND ONLY SAID, "IS MR. ELTON
GONE ON FOOT TO DONWELL?--HE WILL HAVE A HOT WALK."

"OH! NO, IT IS A MEETING AT THE CROWN, A REGULAR MEETING. WESTON AND
COLE WILL BE THERE TOO; BUT ONE IS APT TO SPEAK ONLY OF THOSE WHO
LEAD.--I FANCY MR. E. AND KNIGHTLEY HAVE EVERY THING THEIR OWN WAY."

"HAVE NOT YOU MISTAKEN THE DAY?" SAID EMMA. "I AM ALMOST CERTAIN THAT
THE MEETING AT THE CROWN IS NOT TILL TO-MORROW.--MR. KNIGHTLEY WAS AT
HARTFIELD YESTERDAY, AND SPOKE OF IT AS FOR SATURDAY."

"OH! NO, THE MEETING IS CERTAINLY TO-DAY," WAS THE ABRUPT ANSWER, WHICH
DENOTED THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF ANY BLUNDER ON MRS. ELTON'S SIDE.--"I DO
BELIEVE," SHE CONTINUED, "THIS IS THE MOST TROUBLESOME PARISH THAT EVER
WAS. WE NEVER HEARD OF SUCH THINGS AT MAPLE GROVE."

"YOUR PARISH THERE WAS SMALL," SAID JANE.

"UPON MY WORD, MY DEAR, I DO NOT KNOW, FOR I NEVER HEARD THE SUBJECT
TALKED OF."

"BUT IT IS PROVED BY THE SMALLNESS OF THE SCHOOL, WHICH I HAVE HEARD
YOU SPEAK OF, AS UNDER THE PATRONAGE OF YOUR SISTER AND MRS. BRAGGE; THE
ONLY SCHOOL, AND NOT MORE THAN FIVE-AND-TWENTY CHILDREN."

"AH! YOU CLEVER CREATURE, THAT'S VERY TRUE. WHAT A THINKING BRAIN YOU
HAVE! I SAY, JANE, WHAT A PERFECT CHARACTER YOU AND I SHOULD MAKE, IF WE
COULD BE SHAKEN TOGETHER. MY LIVELINESS AND YOUR SOLIDITY WOULD PRODUCE
PERFECTION.--NOT THAT I PRESUME TO INSINUATE, HOWEVER, THAT SOME
PEOPLE MAY NOT THINK YOU PERFECTION ALREADY.--BUT HUSH!--NOT A WORD,
IF YOU PLEASE."

IT SEEMED AN UNNECESSARY CAUTION; JANE WAS WANTING TO GIVE HER WORDS,
NOT TO MRS. ELTON, BUT TO MISS WOODHOUSE, AS THE LATTER PLAINLY SAW.
THE WISH OF DISTINGUISHING HER, AS FAR AS CIVILITY PERMITTED, WAS VERY
EVIDENT, THOUGH IT COULD NOT OFTEN PROCEED BEYOND A LOOK.

MR. ELTON MADE HIS APPEARANCE. HIS LADY GREETED HIM WITH SOME OF HER
SPARKLING VIVACITY.

"VERY PRETTY, SIR, UPON MY WORD; TO SEND ME ON HERE, TO BE AN
ENCUMBRANCE TO MY FRIENDS, SO LONG BEFORE YOU VOUCHSAFE TO COME!--BUT
YOU KNEW WHAT A DUTIFUL CREATURE YOU HAD TO DEAL WITH. YOU KNEW I SHOULD
NOT STIR TILL MY LORD AND MASTER APPEARED.--HERE HAVE I BEEN SITTING
THIS HOUR, GIVING THESE YOUNG LADIES A SAMPLE OF TRUE CONJUGAL
OBEDIENCE--FOR WHO CAN SAY, YOU KNOW, HOW SOON IT MAY BE WANTED?"

MR. ELTON WAS SO HOT AND TIRED, THAT ALL THIS WIT SEEMED THROWN AWAY.
HIS CIVILITIES TO THE OTHER LADIES MUST BE PAID; BUT HIS SUBSEQUENT
OBJECT WAS TO LAMENT OVER HIMSELF FOR THE HEAT HE WAS SUFFERING, AND THE
WALK HE HAD HAD FOR NOTHING.

"WHEN I GOT TO DONWELL," SAID HE, "KNIGHTLEY COULD NOT BE FOUND. VERY
ODD! VERY UNACCOUNTABLE! AFTER THE NOTE I SENT HIM THIS MORNING, AND THE
MESSAGE HE RETURNED, THAT HE SHOULD CERTAINLY BE AT HOME TILL ONE."

"DONWELL!" CRIED HIS WIFE.--"MY DEAR MR. E., YOU HAVE NOT BEEN TO
DONWELL!--YOU MEAN THE CROWN; YOU COME FROM THE MEETING AT THE CROWN."

"NO, NO, THAT'S TO-MORROW; AND I PARTICULARLY WANTED TO SEE KNIGHTLEY
TO-DAY ON THAT VERY ACCOUNT.--SUCH A DREADFUL BROILING MORNING!--I WENT
OVER THE FIELDS TOO--(SPEAKING IN A TONE OF GREAT ILL-USAGE,) WHICH MADE
IT SO MUCH THE WORSE. AND THEN NOT TO FIND HIM AT HOME! I ASSURE YOU
I AM NOT AT ALL PLEASED. AND NO APOLOGY LEFT, NO MESSAGE FOR ME. THE
HOUSEKEEPER DECLARED SHE KNEW NOTHING OF MY BEING EXPECTED.--VERY
EXTRAORDINARY!--AND NOBODY KNEW AT ALL WHICH WAY HE WAS GONE. PERHAPS
TO HARTFIELD, PERHAPS TO THE ABBEY MILL, PERHAPS INTO HIS WOODS.--MISS
WOODHOUSE, THIS IS NOT LIKE OUR FRIEND KNIGHTLEY!--CAN YOU EXPLAIN IT?"

EMMA AMUSED HERSELF BY PROTESTING THAT IT WAS VERY EXTRAORDINARY,
INDEED, AND THAT SHE HAD NOT A SYLLABLE TO SAY FOR HIM.

"I CANNOT IMAGINE," SAID MRS. ELTON, (FEELING THE INDIGNITY AS A WIFE
OUGHT TO DO,) "I CANNOT IMAGINE HOW HE COULD DO SUCH A THING BY YOU, OF
ALL PEOPLE IN THE WORLD! THE VERY LAST PERSON WHOM ONE SHOULD EXPECT TO
BE FORGOTTEN!--MY DEAR MR. E., HE MUST HAVE LEFT A MESSAGE FOR YOU, I AM
SURE HE MUST.--NOT EVEN KNIGHTLEY COULD BE SO VERY ECCENTRIC;--AND HIS
SERVANTS FORGOT IT. DEPEND UPON IT, THAT WAS THE CASE: AND VERY LIKELY
TO HAPPEN WITH THE DONWELL SERVANTS, WHO ARE ALL, I HAVE OFTEN OBSERVED,
EXTREMELY AWKWARD AND REMISS.--I AM SURE I WOULD NOT HAVE SUCH A
CREATURE AS HIS HARRY STAND AT OUR SIDEBOARD FOR ANY CONSIDERATION. AND
AS FOR MRS. HODGES, WRIGHT HOLDS HER VERY CHEAP INDEED.--SHE PROMISED
WRIGHT A RECEIPT, AND NEVER SENT IT."

"I MET WILLIAM LARKINS," CONTINUED MR. ELTON, "AS I GOT NEAR THE HOUSE,
AND HE TOLD ME I SHOULD NOT FIND HIS MASTER AT HOME, BUT I DID NOT
BELIEVE HIM.--WILLIAM SEEMED RATHER OUT OF HUMOUR. HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT
WAS COME TO HIS MASTER LATELY, HE SAID, BUT HE COULD HARDLY EVER GET THE
SPEECH OF HIM. I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH WILLIAM'S WANTS, BUT IT REALLY
IS OF VERY GREAT IMPORTANCE THAT I SHOULD SEE KNIGHTLEY TO-DAY; AND IT
BECOMES A MATTER, THEREFORE, OF VERY SERIOUS INCONVENIENCE THAT I SHOULD
HAVE HAD THIS HOT WALK TO NO PURPOSE."

EMMA FELT THAT SHE COULD NOT DO BETTER THAN GO HOME DIRECTLY. IN
ALL PROBABILITY SHE WAS AT THIS VERY TIME WAITED FOR THERE; AND MR.
KNIGHTLEY MIGHT BE PRESERVED FROM SINKING DEEPER IN AGGRESSION TOWARDS
MR. ELTON, IF NOT TOWARDS WILLIAM LARKINS.

SHE WAS PLEASED, ON TAKING LEAVE, TO FIND MISS FAIRFAX DETERMINED TO
ATTEND HER OUT OF THE ROOM, TO GO WITH HER EVEN DOWNSTAIRS; IT GAVE HER
AN OPPORTUNITY WHICH SHE IMMEDIATELY MADE USE OF, TO SAY,

"IT IS AS WELL, PERHAPS, THAT I HAVE NOT HAD THE POSSIBILITY. HAD YOU
NOT BEEN SURROUNDED BY OTHER FRIENDS, I MIGHT HAVE BEEN TEMPTED TO
INTRODUCE A SUBJECT, TO ASK QUESTIONS, TO SPEAK MORE OPENLY THAN MIGHT
HAVE BEEN STRICTLY CORRECT.--I FEEL THAT I SHOULD CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN
IMPERTINENT."

"OH!" CRIED JANE, WITH A BLUSH AND AN HESITATION WHICH EMMA THOUGHT
INFINITELY MORE BECOMING TO HER THAN ALL THE ELEGANCE OF ALL HER USUAL
COMPOSURE--"THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO DANGER. THE DANGER WOULD HAVE
BEEN OF MY WEARYING YOU. YOU COULD NOT HAVE GRATIFIED ME MORE THAN
BY EXPRESSING AN INTEREST--. INDEED, MISS WOODHOUSE, (SPEAKING MORE
COLLECTEDLY,) WITH THE CONSCIOUSNESS WHICH I HAVE OF MISCONDUCT, VERY
GREAT MISCONDUCT, IT IS PARTICULARLY CONSOLING TO ME TO KNOW THAT THOSE
OF MY FRIENDS, WHOSE GOOD OPINION IS MOST WORTH PRESERVING, ARE NOT
DISGUSTED TO SUCH A DEGREE AS TO--I HAVE NOT TIME FOR HALF THAT I COULD
WISH TO SAY. I LONG TO MAKE APOLOGIES, EXCUSES, TO URGE SOMETHING FOR
MYSELF. I FEEL IT SO VERY DUE. BUT, UNFORTUNATELY--IN SHORT, IF YOUR
COMPASSION DOES NOT STAND MY FRIEND--"

"OH! YOU ARE TOO SCRUPULOUS, INDEED YOU ARE," CRIED EMMA WARMLY, AND
TAKING HER HAND. "YOU OWE ME NO APOLOGIES; AND EVERY BODY TO WHOM YOU
MIGHT BE SUPPOSED TO OWE THEM, IS SO PERFECTLY SATISFIED, SO DELIGHTED
EVEN--"

"YOU ARE VERY KIND, BUT I KNOW WHAT MY MANNERS WERE TO YOU.--SO
COLD AND ARTIFICIAL!--I HAD ALWAYS A PART TO ACT.--IT WAS A LIFE OF
DECEIT!--I KNOW THAT I MUST HAVE DISGUSTED YOU."

"PRAY SAY NO MORE. I FEEL THAT ALL THE APOLOGIES SHOULD BE ON MY SIDE.
LET US FORGIVE EACH OTHER AT ONCE. WE MUST DO WHATEVER IS TO BE DONE
QUICKEST, AND I THINK OUR FEELINGS WILL LOSE NO TIME THERE. I HOPE YOU
HAVE PLEASANT ACCOUNTS FROM WINDSOR?"

"VERY."

"AND THE NEXT NEWS, I SUPPOSE, WILL BE, THAT WE ARE TO LOSE YOU--JUST AS
I BEGIN TO KNOW YOU."

"OH! AS TO ALL THAT, OF COURSE NOTHING CAN BE THOUGHT OF YET. I AM HERE
TILL CLAIMED BY COLONEL AND MRS. CAMPBELL."

"NOTHING CAN BE ACTUALLY SETTLED YET, PERHAPS," REPLIED EMMA,
SMILING--"BUT, EXCUSE ME, IT MUST BE THOUGHT OF."

THE SMILE WAS RETURNED AS JANE ANSWERED,

"YOU ARE VERY RIGHT; IT HAS BEEN THOUGHT OF. AND I WILL OWN TO YOU, (I
AM SURE IT WILL BE SAFE), THAT SO FAR AS OUR LIVING WITH MR. CHURCHILL
AT ENSCOMBE, IT IS SETTLED. THERE MUST BE THREE MONTHS, AT LEAST, OF
DEEP MOURNING; BUT WHEN THEY ARE OVER, I IMAGINE THERE WILL BE NOTHING
MORE TO WAIT FOR."

"THANK YOU, THANK YOU.--THIS IS JUST WHAT I WANTED TO BE ASSURED
OF.--OH! IF YOU KNEW HOW MUCH I LOVE EVERY THING THAT IS DECIDED AND
OPEN!--GOOD-BYE, GOOD-BYE."



CHAPTER XVII


MRS. WESTON'S FRIENDS WERE ALL MADE HAPPY BY HER SAFETY; AND IF THE
SATISFACTION OF HER WELL-DOING COULD BE INCREASED TO EMMA, IT WAS BY
KNOWING HER TO BE THE MOTHER OF A LITTLE GIRL. SHE HAD BEEN DECIDED IN
WISHING FOR A MISS WESTON. SHE WOULD NOT ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IT WAS WITH
ANY VIEW OF MAKING A MATCH FOR HER, HEREAFTER, WITH EITHER OF ISABELLA'S
SONS; BUT SHE WAS CONVINCED THAT A DAUGHTER WOULD SUIT BOTH FATHER
AND MOTHER BEST. IT WOULD BE A GREAT COMFORT TO MR. WESTON, AS HE GREW
OLDER--AND EVEN MR. WESTON MIGHT BE GROWING OLDER TEN YEARS HENCE--TO
HAVE HIS FIRESIDE ENLIVENED BY THE SPORTS AND THE NONSENSE, THE FREAKS
AND THE FANCIES OF A CHILD NEVER BANISHED FROM HOME; AND MRS. WESTON--NO
ONE COULD DOUBT THAT A DAUGHTER WOULD BE MOST TO HER; AND IT WOULD BE
QUITE A PITY THAT ANY ONE WHO SO WELL KNEW HOW TO TEACH, SHOULD NOT HAVE
THEIR POWERS IN EXERCISE AGAIN.

"SHE HAS HAD THE ADVANTAGE, YOU KNOW, OF PRACTISING ON ME," SHE
CONTINUED--"LIKE LA BARONNE D'ALMANE ON LA COMTESSE D'OSTALIS, IN MADAME
DE GENLIS' ADELAIDE AND THEODORE, AND WE SHALL NOW SEE HER OWN LITTLE
ADELAIDE EDUCATED ON A MORE PERFECT PLAN."

"THAT IS," REPLIED MR. KNIGHTLEY, "SHE WILL INDULGE HER EVEN MORE THAN
SHE DID YOU, AND BELIEVE THAT SHE DOES NOT INDULGE HER AT ALL. IT WILL
BE THE ONLY DIFFERENCE."

"POOR CHILD!" CRIED EMMA; "AT THAT RATE, WHAT WILL BECOME OF HER?"

"NOTHING VERY BAD.--THE FATE OF THOUSANDS. SHE WILL BE DISAGREEABLE
IN INFANCY, AND CORRECT HERSELF AS SHE GROWS OLDER. I AM LOSING ALL MY
BITTERNESS AGAINST SPOILT CHILDREN, MY DEAREST EMMA. I, WHO AM OWING ALL
MY HAPPINESS TO YOU, WOULD NOT IT BE HORRIBLE INGRATITUDE IN ME TO BE
SEVERE ON THEM?"

EMMA LAUGHED, AND REPLIED: "BUT I HAD THE ASSISTANCE OF ALL YOUR
ENDEAVOURS TO COUNTERACT THE INDULGENCE OF OTHER PEOPLE. I DOUBT WHETHER
MY OWN SENSE WOULD HAVE CORRECTED ME WITHOUT IT."

"DO YOU?--I HAVE NO DOUBT. NATURE GAVE YOU UNDERSTANDING:--MISS TAYLOR
GAVE YOU PRINCIPLES. YOU MUST HAVE DONE WELL. MY INTERFERENCE WAS QUITE
AS LIKELY TO DO HARM AS GOOD. IT WAS VERY NATURAL FOR YOU TO SAY, WHAT
RIGHT HAS HE TO LECTURE ME?--AND I AM AFRAID VERY NATURAL FOR YOU TO
FEEL THAT IT WAS DONE IN A DISAGREEABLE MANNER. I DO NOT BELIEVE I DID
YOU ANY GOOD. THE GOOD WAS ALL TO MYSELF, BY MAKING YOU AN OBJECT OF THE
TENDEREST AFFECTION TO ME. I COULD NOT THINK ABOUT YOU SO MUCH WITHOUT
DOATING ON YOU, FAULTS AND ALL; AND BY DINT OF FANCYING SO MANY ERRORS,
HAVE BEEN IN LOVE WITH YOU EVER SINCE YOU WERE THIRTEEN AT LEAST."

"I AM SURE YOU WERE OF USE TO ME," CRIED EMMA. "I WAS VERY OFTEN
INFLUENCED RIGHTLY BY YOU--OFTENER THAN I WOULD OWN AT THE TIME. I
AM VERY SURE YOU DID ME GOOD. AND IF POOR LITTLE ANNA WESTON IS TO BE
SPOILED, IT WILL BE THE GREATEST HUMANITY IN YOU TO DO AS MUCH FOR HER
AS YOU HAVE DONE FOR ME, EXCEPT FALLING IN LOVE WITH HER WHEN SHE IS
THIRTEEN."

"HOW OFTEN, WHEN YOU WERE A GIRL, HAVE YOU SAID TO ME, WITH ONE OF YOUR
SAUCY LOOKS--'MR. KNIGHTLEY, I AM GOING TO DO SO-AND-SO; PAPA SAYS I
MAY, OR I HAVE MISS TAYLOR'S LEAVE'--SOMETHING WHICH, YOU KNEW, I
DID NOT APPROVE. IN SUCH CASES MY INTERFERENCE WAS GIVING YOU TWO BAD
FEELINGS INSTEAD OF ONE."

"WHAT AN AMIABLE CREATURE I WAS!--NO WONDER YOU SHOULD HOLD MY SPEECHES
IN SUCH AFFECTIONATE REMEMBRANCE."

"'MR. KNIGHTLEY.'--YOU ALWAYS CALLED ME, 'MR. KNIGHTLEY;' AND, FROM
HABIT, IT HAS NOT SO VERY FORMAL A SOUND.--AND YET IT IS FORMAL. I WANT
YOU TO CALL ME SOMETHING ELSE, BUT I DO NOT KNOW WHAT."

"I REMEMBER ONCE CALLING YOU 'GEORGE,' IN ONE OF MY AMIABLE FITS, ABOUT
TEN YEARS AGO. I DID IT BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WOULD OFFEND YOU; BUT, AS
YOU MADE NO OBJECTION, I NEVER DID IT AGAIN."

"AND CANNOT YOU CALL ME 'GEORGE' NOW?"

"IMPOSSIBLE!--I NEVER CAN CALL YOU ANY THING BUT 'MR. KNIGHTLEY.' I
WILL NOT PROMISE EVEN TO EQUAL THE ELEGANT TERSENESS OF MRS. ELTON, BY
CALLING YOU MR. K.--BUT I WILL PROMISE," SHE ADDED PRESENTLY, LAUGHING
AND BLUSHING--"I WILL PROMISE TO CALL YOU ONCE BY YOUR CHRISTIAN NAME.
I DO NOT SAY WHEN, BUT PERHAPS YOU MAY GUESS WHERE;--IN THE BUILDING IN
WHICH N. TAKES M. FOR BETTER, FOR WORSE."

EMMA GRIEVED THAT SHE COULD NOT BE MORE OPENLY JUST TO ONE IMPORTANT
SERVICE WHICH HIS BETTER SENSE WOULD HAVE RENDERED HER, TO THE
ADVICE WHICH WOULD HAVE SAVED HER FROM THE WORST OF ALL HER WOMANLY
FOLLIES--HER WILFUL INTIMACY WITH HARRIET SMITH; BUT IT WAS TOO TENDER A
SUBJECT.--SHE COULD NOT ENTER ON IT.--HARRIET WAS VERY SELDOM MENTIONED
BETWEEN THEM. THIS, ON HIS SIDE, MIGHT MERELY PROCEED FROM HER NOT BEING
THOUGHT OF; BUT EMMA WAS RATHER INCLINED TO ATTRIBUTE IT TO DELICACY,
AND A SUSPICION, FROM SOME APPEARANCES, THAT THEIR FRIENDSHIP WERE
DECLINING. SHE WAS AWARE HERSELF, THAT, PARTING UNDER ANY OTHER
CIRCUMSTANCES, THEY CERTAINLY SHOULD HAVE CORRESPONDED MORE, AND THAT
HER INTELLIGENCE WOULD NOT HAVE RESTED, AS IT NOW ALMOST WHOLLY DID, ON
ISABELLA'S LETTERS. HE MIGHT OBSERVE THAT IT WAS SO. THE PAIN OF BEING
OBLIGED TO PRACTISE CONCEALMENT TOWARDS HIM, WAS VERY LITTLE INFERIOR TO
THE PAIN OF HAVING MADE HARRIET UNHAPPY.

ISABELLA SENT QUITE AS GOOD AN ACCOUNT OF HER VISITOR AS COULD BE
EXPECTED; ON HER FIRST ARRIVAL SHE HAD THOUGHT HER OUT OF SPIRITS, WHICH
APPEARED PERFECTLY NATURAL, AS THERE WAS A DENTIST TO BE CONSULTED; BUT,
SINCE THAT BUSINESS HAD BEEN OVER, SHE DID NOT APPEAR TO FIND HARRIET
DIFFERENT FROM WHAT SHE HAD KNOWN HER BEFORE.--ISABELLA, TO BE SURE,
WAS NO VERY QUICK OBSERVER; YET IF HARRIET HAD NOT BEEN EQUAL TO PLAYING
WITH THE CHILDREN, IT WOULD NOT HAVE ESCAPED HER. EMMA'S COMFORTS AND
HOPES WERE MOST AGREEABLY CARRIED ON, BY HARRIET'S BEING TO STAY LONGER;
HER FORTNIGHT WAS LIKELY TO BE A MONTH AT LEAST. MR. AND MRS. JOHN
KNIGHTLEY WERE TO COME DOWN IN AUGUST, AND SHE WAS INVITED TO REMAIN
TILL THEY COULD BRING HER BACK.

"JOHN DOES NOT EVEN MENTION YOUR FRIEND," SAID MR. KNIGHTLEY. "HERE IS
HIS ANSWER, IF YOU LIKE TO SEE IT."

IT WAS THE ANSWER TO THE COMMUNICATION OF HIS INTENDED MARRIAGE. EMMA
ACCEPTED IT WITH A VERY EAGER HAND, WITH AN IMPATIENCE ALL ALIVE TO KNOW
WHAT HE WOULD SAY ABOUT IT, AND NOT AT ALL CHECKED BY HEARING THAT HER
FRIEND WAS UNMENTIONED.

"JOHN ENTERS LIKE A BROTHER INTO MY HAPPINESS," CONTINUED MR. KNIGHTLEY,
"BUT HE IS NO COMPLIMENTER; AND THOUGH I WELL KNOW HIM TO HAVE,
LIKEWISE, A MOST BROTHERLY AFFECTION FOR YOU, HE IS SO FAR FROM MAKING
FLOURISHES, THAT ANY OTHER YOUNG WOMAN MIGHT THINK HIM RATHER COOL IN
HER PRAISE. BUT I AM NOT AFRAID OF YOUR SEEING WHAT HE WRITES."

"HE WRITES LIKE A SENSIBLE MAN," REPLIED EMMA, WHEN SHE HAD READ THE
LETTER. "I HONOUR HIS SINCERITY. IT IS VERY PLAIN THAT HE CONSIDERS THE
GOOD FORTUNE OF THE ENGAGEMENT AS ALL ON MY SIDE, BUT THAT HE IS NOT
WITHOUT HOPE OF MY GROWING, IN TIME, AS WORTHY OF YOUR AFFECTION, AS
YOU THINK ME ALREADY. HAD HE SAID ANY THING TO BEAR A DIFFERENT
CONSTRUCTION, I SHOULD NOT HAVE BELIEVED HIM."

"MY EMMA, HE MEANS NO SUCH THING. HE ONLY MEANS--"

"HE AND I SHOULD DIFFER VERY LITTLE IN OUR ESTIMATION OF THE TWO,"
INTERRUPTED SHE, WITH A SORT OF SERIOUS SMILE--"MUCH LESS, PERHAPS, THAN
HE IS AWARE OF, IF WE COULD ENTER WITHOUT CEREMONY OR RESERVE ON THE
SUBJECT."

"EMMA, MY DEAR EMMA--"

"OH!" SHE CRIED WITH MORE THOROUGH GAIETY, "IF YOU FANCY YOUR BROTHER
DOES NOT DO ME JUSTICE, ONLY WAIT TILL MY DEAR FATHER IS IN THE SECRET,
AND HEAR HIS OPINION. DEPEND UPON IT, HE WILL BE MUCH FARTHER FROM DOING
YOU JUSTICE. HE WILL THINK ALL THE HAPPINESS, ALL THE ADVANTAGE, ON
YOUR SIDE OF THE QUESTION; ALL THE MERIT ON MINE. I WISH I MAY NOT
SINK INTO 'POOR EMMA' WITH HIM AT ONCE.--HIS TENDER COMPASSION TOWARDS
OPPRESSED WORTH CAN GO NO FARTHER."

"AH!" HE CRIED, "I WISH YOUR FATHER MIGHT BE HALF AS EASILY CONVINCED AS
JOHN WILL BE, OF OUR HAVING EVERY RIGHT THAT EQUAL WORTH CAN GIVE, TO BE
HAPPY TOGETHER. I AM AMUSED BY ONE PART OF JOHN'S LETTER--DID YOU NOTICE
IT?--WHERE HE SAYS, THAT MY INFORMATION DID NOT TAKE HIM WHOLLY BY
SURPRIZE, THAT HE WAS RATHER IN EXPECTATION OF HEARING SOMETHING OF THE
KIND."

"IF I UNDERSTAND YOUR BROTHER, HE ONLY MEANS SO FAR AS YOUR HAVING
SOME THOUGHTS OF MARRYING. HE HAD NO IDEA OF ME. HE SEEMS PERFECTLY
UNPREPARED FOR THAT."

"YES, YES--BUT I AM AMUSED THAT HE SHOULD HAVE SEEN SO FAR INTO MY
FEELINGS. WHAT HAS HE BEEN JUDGING BY?--I AM NOT CONSCIOUS OF ANY
DIFFERENCE IN MY SPIRITS OR CONVERSATION THAT COULD PREPARE HIM AT
THIS TIME FOR MY MARRYING ANY MORE THAN AT ANOTHER.--BUT IT WAS SO, I
SUPPOSE. I DARE SAY THERE WAS A DIFFERENCE WHEN I WAS STAYING WITH THEM
THE OTHER DAY. I BELIEVE I DID NOT PLAY WITH THE CHILDREN QUITE SO MUCH
AS USUAL. I REMEMBER ONE EVENING THE POOR BOYS SAYING, 'UNCLE SEEMS
ALWAYS TIRED NOW.'"

THE TIME WAS COMING WHEN THE NEWS MUST SPREAD FARTHER, AND OTHER
PERSONS' RECEPTION OF IT TRIED. AS SOON AS MRS. WESTON WAS SUFFICIENTLY
RECOVERED TO ADMIT MR. WOODHOUSE'S VISITS, EMMA HAVING IT IN VIEW THAT
HER GENTLE REASONINGS SHOULD BE EMPLOYED IN THE CAUSE, RESOLVED FIRST TO
ANNOUNCE IT AT HOME, AND THEN AT RANDALLS.--BUT HOW TO BREAK IT TO HER
FATHER AT LAST!--SHE HAD BOUND HERSELF TO DO IT, IN SUCH AN HOUR OF MR.
KNIGHTLEY'S ABSENCE, OR WHEN IT CAME TO THE POINT HER HEART WOULD HAVE
FAILED HER, AND SHE MUST HAVE PUT IT OFF; BUT MR. KNIGHTLEY WAS TO COME
AT SUCH A TIME, AND FOLLOW UP THE BEGINNING SHE WAS TO MAKE.--SHE WAS
FORCED TO SPEAK, AND TO SPEAK CHEERFULLY TOO. SHE MUST NOT MAKE IT A
MORE DECIDED SUBJECT OF MISERY TO HIM, BY A MELANCHOLY TONE HERSELF.
SHE MUST NOT APPEAR TO THINK IT A MISFORTUNE.--WITH ALL THE SPIRITS SHE
COULD COMMAND, SHE PREPARED HIM FIRST FOR SOMETHING STRANGE, AND THEN,
IN A FEW WORDS, SAID, THAT IF HIS CONSENT AND APPROBATION COULD BE
OBTAINED--WHICH, SHE TRUSTED, WOULD BE ATTENDED WITH NO DIFFICULTY,
SINCE IT WAS A PLAN TO PROMOTE THE HAPPINESS OF ALL--SHE AND MR.
KNIGHTLEY MEANT TO MARRY; BY WHICH MEANS HARTFIELD WOULD RECEIVE THE
CONSTANT ADDITION OF THAT PERSON'S COMPANY WHOM SHE KNEW HE LOVED, NEXT
TO HIS DAUGHTERS AND MRS. WESTON, BEST IN THE WORLD.

POOR MAN!--IT WAS AT FIRST A CONSIDERABLE SHOCK TO HIM, AND HE TRIED
EARNESTLY TO DISSUADE HER FROM IT. SHE WAS REMINDED, MORE THAN ONCE, OF
HAVING ALWAYS SAID SHE WOULD NEVER MARRY, AND ASSURED THAT IT WOULD BE
A GREAT DEAL BETTER FOR HER TO REMAIN SINGLE; AND TOLD OF POOR ISABELLA,
AND POOR MISS TAYLOR.--BUT IT WOULD NOT DO. EMMA HUNG ABOUT HIM
AFFECTIONATELY, AND SMILED, AND SAID IT MUST BE SO; AND THAT HE MUST
NOT CLASS HER WITH ISABELLA AND MRS. WESTON, WHOSE MARRIAGES TAKING THEM
FROM HARTFIELD, HAD, INDEED, MADE A MELANCHOLY CHANGE: BUT SHE WAS NOT
GOING FROM HARTFIELD; SHE SHOULD BE ALWAYS THERE; SHE WAS INTRODUCING
NO CHANGE IN THEIR NUMBERS OR THEIR COMFORTS BUT FOR THE BETTER; AND SHE
WAS VERY SURE THAT HE WOULD BE A GREAT DEAL THE HAPPIER FOR HAVING MR.
KNIGHTLEY ALWAYS AT HAND, WHEN HE WERE ONCE GOT USED TO THE IDEA.--DID
HE NOT LOVE MR. KNIGHTLEY VERY MUCH?--HE WOULD NOT DENY THAT HE DID,
SHE WAS SURE.--WHOM DID HE EVER WANT TO CONSULT ON BUSINESS BUT MR.
KNIGHTLEY?--WHO WAS SO USEFUL TO HIM, WHO SO READY TO WRITE HIS LETTERS,
WHO SO GLAD TO ASSIST HIM?--WHO SO CHEERFUL, SO ATTENTIVE, SO ATTACHED
TO HIM?--WOULD NOT HE LIKE TO HAVE HIM ALWAYS ON THE SPOT?--YES. THAT
WAS ALL VERY TRUE. MR. KNIGHTLEY COULD NOT BE THERE TOO OFTEN; HE SHOULD
BE GLAD TO SEE HIM EVERY DAY;--BUT THEY DID SEE HIM EVERY DAY AS IT
WAS.--WHY COULD NOT THEY GO ON AS THEY HAD DONE?

MR. WOODHOUSE COULD NOT BE SOON RECONCILED; BUT THE WORST WAS OVERCOME,
THE IDEA WAS GIVEN; TIME AND CONTINUAL REPETITION MUST DO THE REST.--TO
EMMA'S ENTREATIES AND ASSURANCES SUCCEEDED MR. KNIGHTLEY'S, WHOSE FOND
PRAISE OF HER GAVE THE SUBJECT EVEN A KIND OF WELCOME; AND HE WAS SOON
USED TO BE TALKED TO BY EACH, ON EVERY FAIR OCCASION.--THEY HAD ALL
THE ASSISTANCE WHICH ISABELLA COULD GIVE, BY LETTERS OF THE STRONGEST
APPROBATION; AND MRS. WESTON WAS READY, ON THE FIRST MEETING, TO
CONSIDER THE SUBJECT IN THE MOST SERVICEABLE LIGHT--FIRST, AS A SETTLED,
AND, SECONDLY, AS A GOOD ONE--WELL AWARE OF THE NEARLY EQUAL IMPORTANCE
OF THE TWO RECOMMENDATIONS TO MR. WOODHOUSE'S MIND.--IT WAS AGREED
UPON, AS WHAT WAS TO BE; AND EVERY BODY BY WHOM HE WAS USED TO BE
GUIDED ASSURING HIM THAT IT WOULD BE FOR HIS HAPPINESS; AND HAVING SOME
FEELINGS HIMSELF WHICH ALMOST ADMITTED IT, HE BEGAN TO THINK THAT SOME
TIME OR OTHER--IN ANOTHER YEAR OR TWO, PERHAPS--IT MIGHT NOT BE SO VERY
BAD IF THE MARRIAGE DID TAKE PLACE.

MRS. WESTON WAS ACTING NO PART, FEIGNING NO FEELINGS IN ALL THAT SHE
SAID TO HIM IN FAVOUR OF THE EVENT.--SHE HAD BEEN EXTREMELY SURPRIZED,
NEVER MORE SO, THAN WHEN EMMA FIRST OPENED THE AFFAIR TO HER; BUT SHE
SAW IN IT ONLY INCREASE OF HAPPINESS TO ALL, AND HAD NO SCRUPLE IN
URGING HIM TO THE UTMOST.--SHE HAD SUCH A REGARD FOR MR. KNIGHTLEY, AS
TO THINK HE DESERVED EVEN HER DEAREST EMMA; AND IT WAS IN EVERY RESPECT
SO PROPER, SUITABLE, AND UNEXCEPTIONABLE A CONNEXION, AND IN ONE
RESPECT, ONE POINT OF THE HIGHEST IMPORTANCE, SO PECULIARLY ELIGIBLE,
SO SINGULARLY FORTUNATE, THAT NOW IT SEEMED AS IF EMMA COULD NOT SAFELY
HAVE ATTACHED HERSELF TO ANY OTHER CREATURE, AND THAT SHE HAD HERSELF
BEEN THE STUPIDEST OF BEINGS IN NOT HAVING THOUGHT OF IT, AND WISHED IT
LONG AGO.--HOW VERY FEW OF THOSE MEN IN A RANK OF LIFE TO ADDRESS EMMA
WOULD HAVE RENOUNCED THEIR OWN HOME FOR HARTFIELD! AND WHO BUT MR.
KNIGHTLEY COULD KNOW AND BEAR WITH MR. WOODHOUSE, SO AS TO MAKE SUCH
AN ARRANGEMENT DESIRABLE!--THE DIFFICULTY OF DISPOSING OF POOR MR.
WOODHOUSE HAD BEEN ALWAYS FELT IN HER HUSBAND'S PLANS AND HER OWN, FOR
A MARRIAGE BETWEEN FRANK AND EMMA. HOW TO SETTLE THE CLAIMS OF ENSCOMBE
AND HARTFIELD HAD BEEN A CONTINUAL IMPEDIMENT--LESS ACKNOWLEDGED BY MR.
WESTON THAN BY HERSELF--BUT EVEN HE HAD NEVER BEEN ABLE TO FINISH
THE SUBJECT BETTER THAN BY SAYING--"THOSE MATTERS WILL TAKE CARE OF
THEMSELVES; THE YOUNG PEOPLE WILL FIND A WAY." BUT HERE THERE WAS
NOTHING TO BE SHIFTED OFF IN A WILD SPECULATION ON THE FUTURE. IT WAS
ALL RIGHT, ALL OPEN, ALL EQUAL. NO SACRIFICE ON ANY SIDE WORTH THE NAME.
IT WAS A UNION OF THE HIGHEST PROMISE OF FELICITY IN ITSELF, AND WITHOUT
ONE REAL, RATIONAL DIFFICULTY TO OPPOSE OR DELAY IT.

MRS. WESTON, WITH HER BABY ON HER KNEE, INDULGING IN SUCH REFLECTIONS
AS THESE, WAS ONE OF THE HAPPIEST WOMEN IN THE WORLD. IF ANY THING COULD
INCREASE HER DELIGHT, IT WAS PERCEIVING THAT THE BABY WOULD SOON HAVE
OUTGROWN ITS FIRST SET OF CAPS.

THE NEWS WAS UNIVERSALLY A SURPRIZE WHEREVER IT SPREAD; AND MR. WESTON
HAD HIS FIVE MINUTES SHARE OF IT; BUT FIVE MINUTES WERE ENOUGH TO
FAMILIARISE THE IDEA TO HIS QUICKNESS OF MIND.--HE SAW THE ADVANTAGES
OF THE MATCH, AND REJOICED IN THEM WITH ALL THE CONSTANCY OF HIS WIFE;
BUT THE WONDER OF IT WAS VERY SOON NOTHING; AND BY THE END OF AN HOUR HE
WAS NOT FAR FROM BELIEVING THAT HE HAD ALWAYS FORESEEN IT.

"IT IS TO BE A SECRET, I CONCLUDE," SAID HE. "THESE MATTERS ARE ALWAYS A
SECRET, TILL IT IS FOUND OUT THAT EVERY BODY KNOWS THEM. ONLY LET ME BE
TOLD WHEN I MAY SPEAK OUT.--I WONDER WHETHER JANE HAS ANY SUSPICION."

HE WENT TO HIGHBURY THE NEXT MORNING, AND SATISFIED HIMSELF ON THAT
POINT. HE TOLD HER THE NEWS. WAS NOT SHE LIKE A DAUGHTER, HIS ELDEST
DAUGHTER?--HE MUST TELL HER; AND MISS BATES BEING PRESENT, IT PASSED,
OF COURSE, TO MRS. COLE, MRS. PERRY, AND MRS. ELTON, IMMEDIATELY
AFTERWARDS. IT WAS NO MORE THAN THE PRINCIPALS WERE PREPARED FOR; THEY
HAD CALCULATED FROM THE TIME OF ITS BEING KNOWN AT RANDALLS, HOW SOON IT
WOULD BE OVER HIGHBURY; AND WERE THINKING OF THEMSELVES, AS THE EVENING
WONDER IN MANY A FAMILY CIRCLE, WITH GREAT SAGACITY.

IN GENERAL, IT WAS A VERY WELL APPROVED MATCH. SOME MIGHT THINK HIM, AND
OTHERS MIGHT THINK HER, THE MOST IN LUCK. ONE SET MIGHT RECOMMEND THEIR
ALL REMOVING TO DONWELL, AND LEAVING HARTFIELD FOR THE JOHN KNIGHTLEYS;
AND ANOTHER MIGHT PREDICT DISAGREEMENTS AMONG THEIR SERVANTS; BUT YET,
UPON THE WHOLE, THERE WAS NO SERIOUS OBJECTION RAISED, EXCEPT IN ONE
HABITATION, THE VICARAGE.--THERE, THE SURPRIZE WAS NOT SOFTENED BY ANY
SATISFACTION. MR. ELTON CARED LITTLE ABOUT IT, COMPARED WITH HIS WIFE;
HE ONLY HOPED "THE YOUNG LADY'S PRIDE WOULD NOW BE CONTENTED;" AND
SUPPOSED "SHE HAD ALWAYS MEANT TO CATCH KNIGHTLEY IF SHE COULD;" AND,
ON THE POINT OF LIVING AT HARTFIELD, COULD DARINGLY EXCLAIM, "RATHER
HE THAN I!"--BUT MRS. ELTON WAS VERY MUCH DISCOMPOSED INDEED.--"POOR
KNIGHTLEY! POOR FELLOW!--SAD BUSINESS FOR HIM."--SHE WAS EXTREMELY
CONCERNED; FOR, THOUGH VERY ECCENTRIC, HE HAD A THOUSAND GOOD
QUALITIES.--HOW COULD HE BE SO TAKEN IN?--DID NOT THINK HIM AT ALL IN
LOVE--NOT IN THE LEAST.--POOR KNIGHTLEY!--THERE WOULD BE AN END OF ALL
PLEASANT INTERCOURSE WITH HIM.--HOW HAPPY HE HAD BEEN TO COME AND DINE
WITH THEM WHENEVER THEY ASKED HIM! BUT THAT WOULD BE ALL OVER NOW.--POOR
FELLOW!--NO MORE EXPLORING PARTIES TO DONWELL MADE FOR HER. OH!
NO; THERE WOULD BE A MRS. KNIGHTLEY TO THROW COLD WATER ON EVERY
THING.--EXTREMELY DISAGREEABLE! BUT SHE WAS NOT AT ALL SORRY THAT
SHE HAD ABUSED THE HOUSEKEEPER THE OTHER DAY.--SHOCKING PLAN, LIVING
TOGETHER. IT WOULD NEVER DO. SHE KNEW A FAMILY NEAR MAPLE GROVE WHO
HAD TRIED IT, AND BEEN OBLIGED TO SEPARATE BEFORE THE END OF THE FIRST
QUARTER.



CHAPTER XVIII


TIME PASSED ON. A FEW MORE TO-MORROWS, AND THE PARTY FROM LONDON WOULD
BE ARRIVING. IT WAS AN ALARMING CHANGE; AND EMMA WAS THINKING OF IT ONE
MORNING, AS WHAT MUST BRING A GREAT DEAL TO AGITATE AND GRIEVE HER, WHEN
MR. KNIGHTLEY CAME IN, AND DISTRESSING THOUGHTS WERE PUT BY. AFTER THE
FIRST CHAT OF PLEASURE HE WAS SILENT; AND THEN, IN A GRAVER TONE, BEGAN
WITH,

"I HAVE SOMETHING TO TELL YOU, EMMA; SOME NEWS."

"GOOD OR BAD?" SAID SHE, QUICKLY, LOOKING UP IN HIS FACE.

"I DO NOT KNOW WHICH IT OUGHT TO BE CALLED."

"OH! GOOD I AM SURE.--I SEE IT IN YOUR COUNTENANCE. YOU ARE TRYING NOT
TO SMILE."

"I AM AFRAID," SAID HE, COMPOSING HIS FEATURES, "I AM VERY MUCH AFRAID,
MY DEAR EMMA, THAT YOU WILL NOT SMILE WHEN YOU HEAR IT."

"INDEED! BUT WHY SO?--I CAN HARDLY IMAGINE THAT ANY THING WHICH PLEASES
OR AMUSES YOU, SHOULD NOT PLEASE AND AMUSE ME TOO."

"THERE IS ONE SUBJECT," HE REPLIED, "I HOPE BUT ONE, ON WHICH WE DO NOT
THINK ALIKE." HE PAUSED A MOMENT, AGAIN SMILING, WITH HIS EYES FIXED ON
HER FACE. "DOES NOTHING OCCUR TO YOU?--DO NOT YOU RECOLLECT?--HARRIET
SMITH."

HER CHEEKS FLUSHED AT THE NAME, AND SHE FELT AFRAID OF SOMETHING, THOUGH
SHE KNEW NOT WHAT.

"HAVE YOU HEARD FROM HER YOURSELF THIS MORNING?" CRIED HE. "YOU HAVE, I
BELIEVE, AND KNOW THE WHOLE."

"NO, I HAVE NOT; I KNOW NOTHING; PRAY TELL ME."

"YOU ARE PREPARED FOR THE WORST, I SEE--AND VERY BAD IT IS. HARRIET
SMITH MARRIES ROBERT MARTIN."

EMMA GAVE A START, WHICH DID NOT SEEM LIKE BEING PREPARED--AND HER EYES,
IN EAGER GAZE, SAID, "NO, THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE!" BUT HER LIPS WERE CLOSED.

"IT IS SO, INDEED," CONTINUED MR. KNIGHTLEY; "I HAVE IT FROM ROBERT
MARTIN HIMSELF. HE LEFT ME NOT HALF AN HOUR AGO."

SHE WAS STILL LOOKING AT HIM WITH THE MOST SPEAKING AMAZEMENT.

"YOU LIKE IT, MY EMMA, AS LITTLE AS I FEARED.--I WISH OUR OPINIONS WERE
THE SAME. BUT IN TIME THEY WILL. TIME, YOU MAY BE SURE, WILL MAKE ONE
OR THE OTHER OF US THINK DIFFERENTLY; AND, IN THE MEANWHILE, WE NEED NOT
TALK MUCH ON THE SUBJECT."

"YOU MISTAKE ME, YOU QUITE MISTAKE ME," SHE REPLIED, EXERTING HERSELF.
"IT IS NOT THAT SUCH A CIRCUMSTANCE WOULD NOW MAKE ME UNHAPPY, BUT I
CANNOT BELIEVE IT. IT SEEMS AN IMPOSSIBILITY!--YOU CANNOT MEAN TO SAY,
THAT HARRIET SMITH HAS ACCEPTED ROBERT MARTIN. YOU CANNOT MEAN THAT HE
HAS EVEN PROPOSED TO HER AGAIN--YET. YOU ONLY MEAN, THAT HE INTENDS IT."

"I MEAN THAT HE HAS DONE IT," ANSWERED MR. KNIGHTLEY, WITH SMILING BUT
DETERMINED DECISION, "AND BEEN ACCEPTED."

"GOOD GOD!" SHE CRIED.--"WELL!"--THEN HAVING RECOURSE TO HER WORKBASKET,
IN EXCUSE FOR LEANING DOWN HER FACE, AND CONCEALING ALL THE EXQUISITE
FEELINGS OF DELIGHT AND ENTERTAINMENT WHICH SHE KNEW SHE MUST BE
EXPRESSING, SHE ADDED, "WELL, NOW TELL ME EVERY THING; MAKE THIS
INTELLIGIBLE TO ME. HOW, WHERE, WHEN?--LET ME KNOW IT ALL. I NEVER WAS
MORE SURPRIZED--BUT IT DOES NOT MAKE ME UNHAPPY, I ASSURE YOU.--HOW--HOW
HAS IT BEEN POSSIBLE?"

"IT IS A VERY SIMPLE STORY. HE WENT TO TOWN ON BUSINESS THREE DAYS AGO,
AND I GOT HIM TO TAKE CHARGE OF SOME PAPERS WHICH I WAS WANTING TO SEND
TO JOHN.--HE DELIVERED THESE PAPERS TO JOHN, AT HIS CHAMBERS, AND WAS
ASKED BY HIM TO JOIN THEIR PARTY THE SAME EVENING TO ASTLEY'S. THEY WERE
GOING TO TAKE THE TWO ELDEST BOYS TO ASTLEY'S. THE PARTY WAS TO BE OUR
BROTHER AND SISTER, HENRY, JOHN--AND MISS SMITH. MY FRIEND ROBERT COULD
NOT RESIST. THEY CALLED FOR HIM IN THEIR WAY; WERE ALL EXTREMELY AMUSED;
AND MY BROTHER ASKED HIM TO DINE WITH THEM THE NEXT DAY--WHICH HE
DID--AND IN THE COURSE OF THAT VISIT (AS I UNDERSTAND) HE FOUND AN
OPPORTUNITY OF SPEAKING TO HARRIET; AND CERTAINLY DID NOT SPEAK
IN VAIN.--SHE MADE HIM, BY HER ACCEPTANCE, AS HAPPY EVEN AS HE IS
DESERVING. HE CAME DOWN BY YESTERDAY'S COACH, AND WAS WITH ME THIS
MORNING IMMEDIATELY AFTER BREAKFAST, TO REPORT HIS PROCEEDINGS, FIRST
ON MY AFFAIRS, AND THEN ON HIS OWN. THIS IS ALL THAT I CAN RELATE OF
THE HOW, WHERE, AND WHEN. YOUR FRIEND HARRIET WILL MAKE A MUCH
LONGER HISTORY WHEN YOU SEE HER.--SHE WILL GIVE YOU ALL THE MINUTE
PARTICULARS, WHICH ONLY WOMAN'S LANGUAGE CAN MAKE INTERESTING.--IN OUR
COMMUNICATIONS WE DEAL ONLY IN THE GREAT.--HOWEVER, I MUST SAY, THAT
ROBERT MARTIN'S HEART SEEMED FOR HIM, AND TO ME, VERY OVERFLOWING;
AND THAT HE DID MENTION, WITHOUT ITS BEING MUCH TO THE PURPOSE, THAT
ON QUITTING THEIR BOX AT ASTLEY'S, MY BROTHER TOOK CHARGE OF MRS. JOHN
KNIGHTLEY AND LITTLE JOHN, AND HE FOLLOWED WITH MISS SMITH AND HENRY;
AND THAT AT ONE TIME THEY WERE IN SUCH A CROWD, AS TO MAKE MISS SMITH
RATHER UNEASY."

HE STOPPED.--EMMA DARED NOT ATTEMPT ANY IMMEDIATE REPLY. TO SPEAK, SHE
WAS SURE WOULD BE TO BETRAY A MOST UNREASONABLE DEGREE OF HAPPINESS.
SHE MUST WAIT A MOMENT, OR HE WOULD THINK HER MAD. HER SILENCE DISTURBED
HIM; AND AFTER OBSERVING HER A LITTLE WHILE, HE ADDED,

"EMMA, MY LOVE, YOU SAID THAT THIS CIRCUMSTANCE WOULD NOT NOW MAKE YOU
UNHAPPY; BUT I AM AFRAID IT GIVES YOU MORE PAIN THAN YOU EXPECTED. HIS
SITUATION IS AN EVIL--BUT YOU MUST CONSIDER IT AS WHAT SATISFIES YOUR
FRIEND; AND I WILL ANSWER FOR YOUR THINKING BETTER AND BETTER OF HIM
AS YOU KNOW HIM MORE. HIS GOOD SENSE AND GOOD PRINCIPLES WOULD DELIGHT
YOU.--AS FAR AS THE MAN IS CONCERNED, YOU COULD NOT WISH YOUR FRIEND
IN BETTER HANDS. HIS RANK IN SOCIETY I WOULD ALTER IF I COULD, WHICH IS
SAYING A GREAT DEAL I ASSURE YOU, EMMA.--YOU LAUGH AT ME ABOUT WILLIAM
LARKINS; BUT I COULD QUITE AS ILL SPARE ROBERT MARTIN."

HE WANTED HER TO LOOK UP AND SMILE; AND HAVING NOW BROUGHT HERSELF NOT
TO SMILE TOO BROADLY--SHE DID--CHEERFULLY ANSWERING,

"YOU NEED NOT BE AT ANY PAINS TO RECONCILE ME TO THE MATCH. I THINK
HARRIET IS DOING EXTREMELY WELL. HER CONNEXIONS MAY BE WORSE THAN
HIS. IN RESPECTABILITY OF CHARACTER, THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT THEY
ARE. I HAVE BEEN SILENT FROM SURPRIZE MERELY, EXCESSIVE SURPRIZE. YOU
CANNOT IMAGINE HOW SUDDENLY IT HAS COME ON ME! HOW PECULIARLY UNPREPARED
I WAS!--FOR I HAD REASON TO BELIEVE HER VERY LATELY MORE DETERMINED
AGAINST HIM, MUCH MORE, THAN SHE WAS BEFORE."

"YOU OUGHT TO KNOW YOUR FRIEND BEST," REPLIED MR. KNIGHTLEY; "BUT I
SHOULD SAY SHE WAS A GOOD-TEMPERED, SOFT-HEARTED GIRL, NOT LIKELY TO BE
VERY, VERY DETERMINED AGAINST ANY YOUNG MAN WHO TOLD HER HE LOVED HER."

EMMA COULD NOT HELP LAUGHING AS SHE ANSWERED, "UPON MY WORD, I BELIEVE
YOU KNOW HER QUITE AS WELL AS I DO.--BUT, MR. KNIGHTLEY, ARE YOU
PERFECTLY SURE THAT SHE HAS ABSOLUTELY AND DOWNRIGHT ACCEPTED HIM.
I COULD SUPPOSE SHE MIGHT IN TIME--BUT CAN SHE ALREADY?--DID NOT YOU
MISUNDERSTAND HIM?--YOU WERE BOTH TALKING OF OTHER THINGS; OF BUSINESS,
SHOWS OF CATTLE, OR NEW DRILLS--AND MIGHT NOT YOU, IN THE CONFUSION OF
SO MANY SUBJECTS, MISTAKE HIM?--IT WAS NOT HARRIET'S HAND THAT HE WAS
CERTAIN OF--IT WAS THE DIMENSIONS OF SOME FAMOUS OX."

THE CONTRAST BETWEEN THE COUNTENANCE AND AIR OF MR. KNIGHTLEY AND ROBERT
MARTIN WAS, AT THIS MOMENT, SO STRONG TO EMMA'S FEELINGS, AND SO STRONG
WAS THE RECOLLECTION OF ALL THAT HAD SO RECENTLY PASSED ON HARRIET'S
SIDE, SO FRESH THE SOUND OF THOSE WORDS, SPOKEN WITH SUCH EMPHASIS,
"NO, I HOPE I KNOW BETTER THAN TO THINK OF ROBERT MARTIN," THAT SHE WAS
REALLY EXPECTING THE INTELLIGENCE TO PROVE, IN SOME MEASURE, PREMATURE.
IT COULD NOT BE OTHERWISE.

"DO YOU DARE SAY THIS?" CRIED MR. KNIGHTLEY. "DO YOU DARE TO SUPPOSE ME
SO GREAT A BLOCKHEAD, AS NOT TO KNOW WHAT A MAN IS TALKING OF?--WHAT DO
YOU DESERVE?"

"OH! I ALWAYS DESERVE THE BEST TREATMENT, BECAUSE I NEVER PUT UP WITH
ANY OTHER; AND, THEREFORE, YOU MUST GIVE ME A PLAIN, DIRECT ANSWER. ARE
YOU QUITE SURE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND THE TERMS ON WHICH MR. MARTIN AND
HARRIET NOW ARE?"

"I AM QUITE SURE," HE REPLIED, SPEAKING VERY DISTINCTLY, "THAT HE
TOLD ME SHE HAD ACCEPTED HIM; AND THAT THERE WAS NO OBSCURITY, NOTHING
DOUBTFUL, IN THE WORDS HE USED; AND I THINK I CAN GIVE YOU A PROOF THAT
IT MUST BE SO. HE ASKED MY OPINION AS TO WHAT HE WAS NOW TO DO. HE KNEW
OF NO ONE BUT MRS. GODDARD TO WHOM HE COULD APPLY FOR INFORMATION OF
HER RELATIONS OR FRIENDS. COULD I MENTION ANY THING MORE FIT TO BE DONE,
THAN TO GO TO MRS. GODDARD? I ASSURED HIM THAT I COULD NOT. THEN, HE
SAID, HE WOULD ENDEAVOUR TO SEE HER IN THE COURSE OF THIS DAY."

"I AM PERFECTLY SATISFIED," REPLIED EMMA, WITH THE BRIGHTEST SMILES,
"AND MOST SINCERELY WISH THEM HAPPY."

"YOU ARE MATERIALLY CHANGED SINCE WE TALKED ON THIS SUBJECT BEFORE."

"I HOPE SO--FOR AT THAT TIME I WAS A FOOL."

"AND I AM CHANGED ALSO; FOR I AM NOW VERY WILLING TO GRANT YOU ALL
HARRIET'S GOOD QUALITIES. I HAVE TAKEN SOME PAINS FOR YOUR SAKE, AND FOR
ROBERT MARTIN'S SAKE, (WHOM I HAVE ALWAYS HAD REASON TO BELIEVE AS MUCH
IN LOVE WITH HER AS EVER,) TO GET ACQUAINTED WITH HER. I HAVE OFTEN
TALKED TO HER A GOOD DEAL. YOU MUST HAVE SEEN THAT I DID. SOMETIMES,
INDEED, I HAVE THOUGHT YOU WERE HALF SUSPECTING ME OF PLEADING POOR
MARTIN'S CAUSE, WHICH WAS NEVER THE CASE; BUT, FROM ALL MY OBSERVATIONS,
I AM CONVINCED OF HER BEING AN ARTLESS, AMIABLE GIRL, WITH VERY GOOD
NOTIONS, VERY SERIOUSLY GOOD PRINCIPLES, AND PLACING HER HAPPINESS IN
THE AFFECTIONS AND UTILITY OF DOMESTIC LIFE.--MUCH OF THIS, I HAVE NO
DOUBT, SHE MAY THANK YOU FOR."

"ME!" CRIED EMMA, SHAKING HER HEAD.--"AH! POOR HARRIET!"

SHE CHECKED HERSELF, HOWEVER, AND SUBMITTED QUIETLY TO A LITTLE MORE
PRAISE THAN SHE DESERVED.

THEIR CONVERSATION WAS SOON AFTERWARDS CLOSED BY THE ENTRANCE OF HER
FATHER. SHE WAS NOT SORRY. SHE WANTED TO BE ALONE. HER MIND WAS IN A
STATE OF FLUTTER AND WONDER, WHICH MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR HER TO BE
COLLECTED. SHE WAS IN DANCING, SINGING, EXCLAIMING SPIRITS; AND TILL SHE
HAD MOVED ABOUT, AND TALKED TO HERSELF, AND LAUGHED AND REFLECTED, SHE
COULD BE FIT FOR NOTHING RATIONAL.

HER FATHER'S BUSINESS WAS TO ANNOUNCE JAMES'S BEING GONE OUT TO PUT THE
HORSES TO, PREPARATORY TO THEIR NOW DAILY DRIVE TO RANDALLS; AND SHE
HAD, THEREFORE, AN IMMEDIATE EXCUSE FOR DISAPPEARING.

THE JOY, THE GRATITUDE, THE EXQUISITE DELIGHT OF HER SENSATIONS MAY BE
IMAGINED. THE SOLE GRIEVANCE AND ALLOY THUS REMOVED IN THE PROSPECT OF
HARRIET'S WELFARE, SHE WAS REALLY IN DANGER OF BECOMING TOO HAPPY FOR
SECURITY.--WHAT HAD SHE TO WISH FOR? NOTHING, BUT TO GROW MORE WORTHY OF
HIM, WHOSE INTENTIONS AND JUDGMENT HAD BEEN EVER SO SUPERIOR TO HER OWN.
NOTHING, BUT THAT THE LESSONS OF HER PAST FOLLY MIGHT TEACH HER HUMILITY
AND CIRCUMSPECTION IN FUTURE.

SERIOUS SHE WAS, VERY SERIOUS IN HER THANKFULNESS, AND IN HER
RESOLUTIONS; AND YET THERE WAS NO PREVENTING A LAUGH, SOMETIMES IN THE
VERY MIDST OF THEM. SHE MUST LAUGH AT SUCH A CLOSE! SUCH AN END OF THE
DOLEFUL DISAPPOINTMENT OF FIVE WEEKS BACK! SUCH A HEART--SUCH A HARRIET!

NOW THERE WOULD BE PLEASURE IN HER RETURNING--EVERY THING WOULD BE A
PLEASURE. IT WOULD BE A GREAT PLEASURE TO KNOW ROBERT MARTIN.

HIGH IN THE RANK OF HER MOST SERIOUS AND HEARTFELT FELICITIES, WAS THE
REFLECTION THAT ALL NECESSITY OF CONCEALMENT FROM MR. KNIGHTLEY WOULD
SOON BE OVER. THE DISGUISE, EQUIVOCATION, MYSTERY, SO HATEFUL TO HER TO
PRACTISE, MIGHT SOON BE OVER. SHE COULD NOW LOOK FORWARD TO GIVING HIM
THAT FULL AND PERFECT CONFIDENCE WHICH HER DISPOSITION WAS MOST READY TO
WELCOME AS A DUTY.

IN THE GAYEST AND HAPPIEST SPIRITS SHE SET FORWARD WITH HER FATHER; NOT
ALWAYS LISTENING, BUT ALWAYS AGREEING TO WHAT HE SAID; AND, WHETHER IN
SPEECH OR SILENCE, CONNIVING AT THE COMFORTABLE PERSUASION OF HIS
BEING OBLIGED TO GO TO RANDALLS EVERY DAY, OR POOR MRS. WESTON WOULD BE
DISAPPOINTED.

THEY ARRIVED.--MRS. WESTON WAS ALONE IN THE DRAWING-ROOM:--BUT HARDLY
HAD THEY BEEN TOLD OF THE BABY, AND MR. WOODHOUSE RECEIVED THE THANKS
FOR COMING, WHICH HE ASKED FOR, WHEN A GLIMPSE WAS CAUGHT THROUGH THE
BLIND, OF TWO FIGURES PASSING NEAR THE WINDOW.

"IT IS FRANK AND MISS FAIRFAX," SAID MRS. WESTON. "I WAS JUST GOING TO
TELL YOU OF OUR AGREEABLE SURPRIZE IN SEEING HIM ARRIVE THIS MORNING. HE
STAYS TILL TO-MORROW, AND MISS FAIRFAX HAS BEEN PERSUADED TO SPEND THE
DAY WITH US.--THEY ARE COMING IN, I HOPE."

IN HALF A MINUTE THEY WERE IN THE ROOM. EMMA WAS EXTREMELY GLAD TO
SEE HIM--BUT THERE WAS A DEGREE OF CONFUSION--A NUMBER OF EMBARRASSING
RECOLLECTIONS ON EACH SIDE. THEY MET READILY AND SMILING, BUT WITH A
CONSCIOUSNESS WHICH AT FIRST ALLOWED LITTLE TO BE SAID; AND HAVING ALL
SAT DOWN AGAIN, THERE WAS FOR SOME TIME SUCH A BLANK IN THE CIRCLE, THAT
EMMA BEGAN TO DOUBT WHETHER THE WISH NOW INDULGED, WHICH SHE HAD LONG
FELT, OF SEEING FRANK CHURCHILL ONCE MORE, AND OF SEEING HIM WITH JANE,
WOULD YIELD ITS PROPORTION OF PLEASURE. WHEN MR. WESTON JOINED THE
PARTY, HOWEVER, AND WHEN THE BABY WAS FETCHED, THERE WAS NO LONGER A
WANT OF SUBJECT OR ANIMATION--OR OF COURAGE AND OPPORTUNITY FOR FRANK
CHURCHILL TO DRAW NEAR HER AND SAY,

"I HAVE TO THANK YOU, MISS WOODHOUSE, FOR A VERY KIND FORGIVING MESSAGE
IN ONE OF MRS. WESTON'S LETTERS. I HOPE TIME HAS NOT MADE YOU LESS
WILLING TO PARDON. I HOPE YOU DO NOT RETRACT WHAT YOU THEN SAID."

"NO, INDEED," CRIED EMMA, MOST HAPPY TO BEGIN, "NOT IN THE LEAST. I AM
PARTICULARLY GLAD TO SEE AND SHAKE HANDS WITH YOU--AND TO GIVE YOU JOY
IN PERSON."

HE THANKED HER WITH ALL HIS HEART, AND CONTINUED SOME TIME TO SPEAK WITH
SERIOUS FEELING OF HIS GRATITUDE AND HAPPINESS.

"IS NOT SHE LOOKING WELL?" SAID HE, TURNING HIS EYES TOWARDS JANE.
"BETTER THAN SHE EVER USED TO DO?--YOU SEE HOW MY FATHER AND MRS. WESTON
DOAT UPON HER."

BUT HIS SPIRITS WERE SOON RISING AGAIN, AND WITH LAUGHING EYES, AFTER
MENTIONING THE EXPECTED RETURN OF THE CAMPBELLS, HE NAMED THE NAME OF
DIXON.--EMMA BLUSHED, AND FORBADE ITS BEING PRONOUNCED IN HER HEARING.

"I CAN NEVER THINK OF IT," SHE CRIED, "WITHOUT EXTREME SHAME."

"THE SHAME," HE ANSWERED, "IS ALL MINE, OR OUGHT TO BE. BUT IS IT
POSSIBLE THAT YOU HAD NO SUSPICION?--I MEAN OF LATE. EARLY, I KNOW, YOU
HAD NONE."

"I NEVER HAD THE SMALLEST, I ASSURE YOU."

"THAT APPEARS QUITE WONDERFUL. I WAS ONCE VERY NEAR--AND I WISH I
HAD--IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER. BUT THOUGH I WAS ALWAYS DOING WRONG
THINGS, THEY WERE VERY BAD WRONG THINGS, AND SUCH AS DID ME NO
SERVICE.--IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A MUCH BETTER TRANSGRESSION HAD I BROKEN
THE BOND OF SECRECY AND TOLD YOU EVERY THING."

"IT IS NOT NOW WORTH A REGRET," SAID EMMA.

"I HAVE SOME HOPE," RESUMED HE, "OF MY UNCLE'S BEING PERSUADED TO PAY A
VISIT AT RANDALLS; HE WANTS TO BE INTRODUCED TO HER. WHEN THE CAMPBELLS
ARE RETURNED, WE SHALL MEET THEM IN LONDON, AND CONTINUE THERE, I TRUST,
TILL WE MAY CARRY HER NORTHWARD.--BUT NOW, I AM AT SUCH A DISTANCE FROM
HER--IS NOT IT HARD, MISS WOODHOUSE?--TILL THIS MORNING, WE HAVE NOT
ONCE MET SINCE THE DAY OF RECONCILIATION. DO NOT YOU PITY ME?"

EMMA SPOKE HER PITY SO VERY KINDLY, THAT WITH A SUDDEN ACCESSION OF GAY
THOUGHT, HE CRIED,

"AH! BY THE BYE," THEN SINKING HIS VOICE, AND LOOKING DEMURE FOR THE
MOMENT--"I HOPE MR. KNIGHTLEY IS WELL?" HE PAUSED.--SHE COLOURED AND
LAUGHED.--"I KNOW YOU SAW MY LETTER, AND THINK YOU MAY REMEMBER MY WISH
IN YOUR FAVOUR. LET ME RETURN YOUR CONGRATULATIONS.--I ASSURE YOU THAT
I HAVE HEARD THE NEWS WITH THE WARMEST INTEREST AND SATISFACTION.--HE IS
A MAN WHOM I CANNOT PRESUME TO PRAISE."

EMMA WAS DELIGHTED, AND ONLY WANTED HIM TO GO ON IN THE SAME STYLE; BUT
HIS MIND WAS THE NEXT MOMENT IN HIS OWN CONCERNS AND WITH HIS OWN JANE,
AND HIS NEXT WORDS WERE,

"DID YOU EVER SEE SUCH A SKIN?--SUCH SMOOTHNESS! SUCH DELICACY!--AND
YET WITHOUT BEING ACTUALLY FAIR.--ONE CANNOT CALL HER FAIR. IT IS A
MOST UNCOMMON COMPLEXION, WITH HER DARK EYE-LASHES AND HAIR--A MOST
DISTINGUISHING COMPLEXION! SO PECULIARLY THE LADY IN IT.--JUST COLOUR
ENOUGH FOR BEAUTY."

"I HAVE ALWAYS ADMIRED HER COMPLEXION," REPLIED EMMA, ARCHLY; "BUT
DO NOT I REMEMBER THE TIME WHEN YOU FOUND FAULT WITH HER FOR BEING SO
PALE?--WHEN WE FIRST BEGAN TO TALK OF HER.--HAVE YOU QUITE FORGOTTEN?"

"OH! NO--WHAT AN IMPUDENT DOG I WAS!--HOW COULD I DARE--"

BUT HE LAUGHED SO HEARTILY AT THE RECOLLECTION, THAT EMMA COULD NOT HELP
SAYING,

"I DO SUSPECT THAT IN THE MIDST OF YOUR PERPLEXITIES AT THAT TIME, YOU
HAD VERY GREAT AMUSEMENT IN TRICKING US ALL.--I AM SURE YOU HAD.--I AM
SURE IT WAS A CONSOLATION TO YOU."

"OH! NO, NO, NO--HOW CAN YOU SUSPECT ME OF SUCH A THING? I WAS THE MOST
MISERABLE WRETCH!"

"NOT QUITE SO MISERABLE AS TO BE INSENSIBLE TO MIRTH. I AM SURE IT WAS A
SOURCE OF HIGH ENTERTAINMENT TO YOU, TO FEEL THAT YOU WERE TAKING US
ALL IN.--PERHAPS I AM THE READIER TO SUSPECT, BECAUSE, TO TELL YOU THE
TRUTH, I THINK IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN SOME AMUSEMENT TO MYSELF IN THE SAME
SITUATION. I THINK THERE IS A LITTLE LIKENESS BETWEEN US."

HE BOWED.

"IF NOT IN OUR DISPOSITIONS," SHE PRESENTLY ADDED, WITH A LOOK OF TRUE
SENSIBILITY, "THERE IS A LIKENESS IN OUR DESTINY; THE DESTINY WHICH BIDS
FAIR TO CONNECT US WITH TWO CHARACTERS SO MUCH SUPERIOR TO OUR OWN."

"TRUE, TRUE," HE ANSWERED, WARMLY. "NO, NOT TRUE ON YOUR SIDE. YOU CAN
HAVE NO SUPERIOR, BUT MOST TRUE ON MINE.--SHE IS A COMPLETE ANGEL. LOOK
AT HER. IS NOT SHE AN ANGEL IN EVERY GESTURE? OBSERVE THE TURN OF HER
THROAT. OBSERVE HER EYES, AS SHE IS LOOKING UP AT MY FATHER.--YOU WILL
BE GLAD TO HEAR (INCLINING HIS HEAD, AND WHISPERING SERIOUSLY) THAT MY
UNCLE MEANS TO GIVE HER ALL MY AUNT'S JEWELS. THEY ARE TO BE NEW SET.
I AM RESOLVED TO HAVE SOME IN AN ORNAMENT FOR THE HEAD. WILL NOT IT BE
BEAUTIFUL IN HER DARK HAIR?"

"VERY BEAUTIFUL, INDEED," REPLIED EMMA; AND SHE SPOKE SO KINDLY, THAT HE
GRATEFULLY BURST OUT,

"HOW DELIGHTED I AM TO SEE YOU AGAIN! AND TO SEE YOU IN SUCH EXCELLENT
LOOKS!--I WOULD NOT HAVE MISSED THIS MEETING FOR THE WORLD. I SHOULD
CERTAINLY HAVE CALLED AT HARTFIELD, HAD YOU FAILED TO COME."

THE OTHERS HAD BEEN TALKING OF THE CHILD, MRS. WESTON GIVING AN ACCOUNT
OF A LITTLE ALARM SHE HAD BEEN UNDER, THE EVENING BEFORE, FROM THE
INFANT'S APPEARING NOT QUITE WELL. SHE BELIEVED SHE HAD BEEN FOOLISH,
BUT IT HAD ALARMED HER, AND SHE HAD BEEN WITHIN HALF A MINUTE OF SENDING
FOR MR. PERRY. PERHAPS SHE OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED, BUT MR. WESTON HAD BEEN
ALMOST AS UNEASY AS HERSELF.--IN TEN MINUTES, HOWEVER, THE CHILD HAD
BEEN PERFECTLY WELL AGAIN. THIS WAS HER HISTORY; AND PARTICULARLY
INTERESTING IT WAS TO MR. WOODHOUSE, WHO COMMENDED HER VERY MUCH FOR
THINKING OF SENDING FOR PERRY, AND ONLY REGRETTED THAT SHE HAD NOT DONE
IT. "SHE SHOULD ALWAYS SEND FOR PERRY, IF THE CHILD APPEARED IN THE
SLIGHTEST DEGREE DISORDERED, WERE IT ONLY FOR A MOMENT. SHE COULD NOT BE
TOO SOON ALARMED, NOR SEND FOR PERRY TOO OFTEN. IT WAS A PITY, PERHAPS,
THAT HE HAD NOT COME LAST NIGHT; FOR, THOUGH THE CHILD SEEMED WELL NOW,
VERY WELL CONSIDERING, IT WOULD PROBABLY HAVE BEEN BETTER IF PERRY HAD
SEEN IT."

FRANK CHURCHILL CAUGHT THE NAME.

"PERRY!" SAID HE TO EMMA, AND TRYING, AS HE SPOKE, TO CATCH MISS
FAIRFAX'S EYE. "MY FRIEND MR. PERRY! WHAT ARE THEY SAYING ABOUT MR.
PERRY?--HAS HE BEEN HERE THIS MORNING?--AND HOW DOES HE TRAVEL NOW?--HAS
HE SET UP HIS CARRIAGE?"

EMMA SOON RECOLLECTED, AND UNDERSTOOD HIM; AND WHILE SHE JOINED IN THE
LAUGH, IT WAS EVIDENT FROM JANE'S COUNTENANCE THAT SHE TOO WAS REALLY
HEARING HIM, THOUGH TRYING TO SEEM DEAF.

"SUCH AN EXTRAORDINARY DREAM OF MINE!" HE CRIED. "I CAN NEVER THINK OF
IT WITHOUT LAUGHING.--SHE HEARS US, SHE HEARS US, MISS WOODHOUSE. I SEE
IT IN HER CHEEK, HER SMILE, HER VAIN ATTEMPT TO FROWN. LOOK AT HER. DO
NOT YOU SEE THAT, AT THIS INSTANT, THE VERY PASSAGE OF HER OWN LETTER,
WHICH SENT ME THE REPORT, IS PASSING UNDER HER EYE--THAT THE WHOLE
BLUNDER IS SPREAD BEFORE HER--THAT SHE CAN ATTEND TO NOTHING ELSE,
THOUGH PRETENDING TO LISTEN TO THE OTHERS?"

JANE WAS FORCED TO SMILE COMPLETELY, FOR A MOMENT; AND THE SMILE PARTLY
REMAINED AS SHE TURNED TOWARDS HIM, AND SAID IN A CONSCIOUS, LOW, YET
STEADY VOICE,

"HOW YOU CAN BEAR SUCH RECOLLECTIONS, IS ASTONISHING TO ME!--THEY
WILL SOMETIMES OBTRUDE--BUT HOW YOU CAN COURT THEM!"

HE HAD A GREAT DEAL TO SAY IN RETURN, AND VERY ENTERTAININGLY; BUT
EMMA'S FEELINGS WERE CHIEFLY WITH JANE, IN THE ARGUMENT; AND ON LEAVING
RANDALLS, AND FALLING NATURALLY INTO A COMPARISON OF THE TWO MEN, SHE
FELT, THAT PLEASED AS SHE HAD BEEN TO SEE FRANK CHURCHILL, AND REALLY
REGARDING HIM AS SHE DID WITH FRIENDSHIP, SHE HAD NEVER BEEN MORE
SENSIBLE OF MR. KNIGHTLEY'S HIGH SUPERIORITY OF CHARACTER. THE HAPPINESS
OF THIS MOST HAPPY DAY, RECEIVED ITS COMPLETION, IN THE ANIMATED
CONTEMPLATION OF HIS WORTH WHICH THIS COMPARISON PRODUCED.



CHAPTER XIX


IF EMMA HAD STILL, AT INTERVALS, AN ANXIOUS FEELING FOR HARRIET, A
MOMENTARY DOUBT OF ITS BEING POSSIBLE FOR HER TO BE REALLY CURED OF HER
ATTACHMENT TO MR. KNIGHTLEY, AND REALLY ABLE TO ACCEPT ANOTHER MAN FROM
UNBIASED INCLINATION, IT WAS NOT LONG THAT SHE HAD TO SUFFER FROM THE
RECURRENCE OF ANY SUCH UNCERTAINTY. A VERY FEW DAYS BROUGHT THE PARTY
FROM LONDON, AND SHE HAD NO SOONER AN OPPORTUNITY OF BEING ONE HOUR
ALONE WITH HARRIET, THAN SHE BECAME PERFECTLY SATISFIED--UNACCOUNTABLE
AS IT WAS!--THAT ROBERT MARTIN HAD THOROUGHLY SUPPLANTED MR. KNIGHTLEY,
AND WAS NOW FORMING ALL HER VIEWS OF HAPPINESS.

HARRIET WAS A LITTLE DISTRESSED--DID LOOK A LITTLE FOOLISH AT FIRST:
BUT HAVING ONCE OWNED THAT SHE HAD BEEN PRESUMPTUOUS AND SILLY, AND
SELF-DECEIVED, BEFORE, HER PAIN AND CONFUSION SEEMED TO DIE AWAY WITH
THE WORDS, AND LEAVE HER WITHOUT A CARE FOR THE PAST, AND WITH THE
FULLEST EXULTATION IN THE PRESENT AND FUTURE; FOR, AS TO HER FRIEND'S
APPROBATION, EMMA HAD INSTANTLY REMOVED EVERY FEAR OF THAT NATURE, BY
MEETING HER WITH THE MOST UNQUALIFIED CONGRATULATIONS.--HARRIET WAS
MOST HAPPY TO GIVE EVERY PARTICULAR OF THE EVENING AT ASTLEY'S, AND THE
DINNER THE NEXT DAY; SHE COULD DWELL ON IT ALL WITH THE UTMOST DELIGHT.
BUT WHAT DID SUCH PARTICULARS EXPLAIN?--THE FACT WAS, AS EMMA COULD NOW
ACKNOWLEDGE, THAT HARRIET HAD ALWAYS LIKED ROBERT MARTIN; AND THAT HIS
CONTINUING TO LOVE HER HAD BEEN IRRESISTIBLE.--BEYOND THIS, IT MUST EVER
BE UNINTELLIGIBLE TO EMMA.

THE EVENT, HOWEVER, WAS MOST JOYFUL; AND EVERY DAY WAS GIVING HER FRESH
REASON FOR THINKING SO.--HARRIET'S PARENTAGE BECAME KNOWN. SHE PROVED
TO BE THE DAUGHTER OF A TRADESMAN, RICH ENOUGH TO AFFORD HER THE
COMFORTABLE MAINTENANCE WHICH HAD EVER BEEN HERS, AND DECENT ENOUGH TO
HAVE ALWAYS WISHED FOR CONCEALMENT.--SUCH WAS THE BLOOD OF GENTILITY
WHICH EMMA HAD FORMERLY BEEN SO READY TO VOUCH FOR!--IT WAS LIKELY TO
BE AS UNTAINTED, PERHAPS, AS THE BLOOD OF MANY A GENTLEMAN: BUT WHAT
A CONNEXION HAD SHE BEEN PREPARING FOR MR. KNIGHTLEY--OR FOR THE
CHURCHILLS--OR EVEN FOR MR. ELTON!--THE STAIN OF ILLEGITIMACY,
UNBLEACHED BY NOBILITY OR WEALTH, WOULD HAVE BEEN A STAIN INDEED.

NO OBJECTION WAS RAISED ON THE FATHER'S SIDE; THE YOUNG MAN WAS TREATED
LIBERALLY; IT WAS ALL AS IT SHOULD BE: AND AS EMMA BECAME ACQUAINTED
WITH ROBERT MARTIN, WHO WAS NOW INTRODUCED AT HARTFIELD, SHE FULLY
ACKNOWLEDGED IN HIM ALL THE APPEARANCE OF SENSE AND WORTH WHICH COULD
BID FAIREST FOR HER LITTLE FRIEND. SHE HAD NO DOUBT OF HARRIET'S
HAPPINESS WITH ANY GOOD-TEMPERED MAN; BUT WITH HIM, AND IN THE HOME HE
OFFERED, THERE WOULD BE THE HOPE OF MORE, OF SECURITY, STABILITY, AND
IMPROVEMENT. SHE WOULD BE PLACED IN THE MIDST OF THOSE WHO LOVED HER,
AND WHO HAD BETTER SENSE THAN HERSELF; RETIRED ENOUGH FOR SAFETY,
AND OCCUPIED ENOUGH FOR CHEERFULNESS. SHE WOULD BE NEVER LED INTO
TEMPTATION, NOR LEFT FOR IT TO FIND HER OUT. SHE WOULD BE RESPECTABLE
AND HAPPY; AND EMMA ADMITTED HER TO BE THE LUCKIEST CREATURE IN THE
WORLD, TO HAVE CREATED SO STEADY AND PERSEVERING AN AFFECTION IN SUCH A
MAN;--OR, IF NOT QUITE THE LUCKIEST, TO YIELD ONLY TO HERSELF.

HARRIET, NECESSARILY DRAWN AWAY BY HER ENGAGEMENTS WITH THE MARTINS,
WAS LESS AND LESS AT HARTFIELD; WHICH WAS NOT TO BE REGRETTED.--THE
INTIMACY BETWEEN HER AND EMMA MUST SINK; THEIR FRIENDSHIP MUST CHANGE
INTO A CALMER SORT OF GOODWILL; AND, FORTUNATELY, WHAT OUGHT TO BE,
AND MUST BE, SEEMED ALREADY BEGINNING, AND IN THE MOST GRADUAL, NATURAL
MANNER.

BEFORE THE END OF SEPTEMBER, EMMA ATTENDED HARRIET TO CHURCH, AND SAW
HER HAND BESTOWED ON ROBERT MARTIN WITH SO COMPLETE A SATISFACTION, AS
NO REMEMBRANCES, EVEN CONNECTED WITH MR. ELTON AS HE STOOD BEFORE THEM,
COULD IMPAIR.--PERHAPS, INDEED, AT THAT TIME SHE SCARCELY SAW MR. ELTON,
BUT AS THE CLERGYMAN WHOSE BLESSING AT THE ALTAR MIGHT NEXT FALL ON
HERSELF.--ROBERT MARTIN AND HARRIET SMITH, THE LATEST COUPLE ENGAGED OF
THE THREE, WERE THE FIRST TO BE MARRIED.

JANE FAIRFAX HAD ALREADY QUITTED HIGHBURY, AND WAS RESTORED TO THE
COMFORTS OF HER BELOVED HOME WITH THE CAMPBELLS.--THE MR. CHURCHILLS
WERE ALSO IN TOWN; AND THEY WERE ONLY WAITING FOR NOVEMBER.

THE INTERMEDIATE MONTH WAS THE ONE FIXED ON, AS FAR AS THEY DARED, BY
EMMA AND MR. KNIGHTLEY.--THEY HAD DETERMINED THAT THEIR MARRIAGE OUGHT
TO BE CONCLUDED WHILE JOHN AND ISABELLA WERE STILL AT HARTFIELD, TO
ALLOW THEM THE FORTNIGHT'S ABSENCE IN A TOUR TO THE SEASIDE, WHICH WAS
THE PLAN.--JOHN AND ISABELLA, AND EVERY OTHER FRIEND, WERE AGREED IN
APPROVING IT. BUT MR. WOODHOUSE--HOW WAS MR. WOODHOUSE TO BE INDUCED
TO CONSENT?--HE, WHO HAD NEVER YET ALLUDED TO THEIR MARRIAGE BUT AS A
DISTANT EVENT.

WHEN FIRST SOUNDED ON THE SUBJECT, HE WAS SO MISERABLE, THAT THEY WERE
ALMOST HOPELESS.--A SECOND ALLUSION, INDEED, GAVE LESS PAIN.--HE
BEGAN TO THINK IT WAS TO BE, AND THAT HE COULD NOT PREVENT IT--A VERY
PROMISING STEP OF THE MIND ON ITS WAY TO RESIGNATION. STILL, HOWEVER, HE
WAS NOT HAPPY. NAY, HE APPEARED SO MUCH OTHERWISE, THAT HIS DAUGHTER'S
COURAGE FAILED. SHE COULD NOT BEAR TO SEE HIM SUFFERING, TO KNOW
HIM FANCYING HIMSELF NEGLECTED; AND THOUGH HER UNDERSTANDING ALMOST
ACQUIESCED IN THE ASSURANCE OF BOTH THE MR. KNIGHTLEYS, THAT WHEN
ONCE THE EVENT WERE OVER, HIS DISTRESS WOULD BE SOON OVER TOO, SHE
HESITATED--SHE COULD NOT PROCEED.

IN THIS STATE OF SUSPENSE THEY WERE BEFRIENDED, NOT BY ANY SUDDEN
ILLUMINATION OF MR. WOODHOUSE'S MIND, OR ANY WONDERFUL CHANGE OF HIS
NERVOUS SYSTEM, BUT BY THE OPERATION OF THE SAME SYSTEM IN ANOTHER
WAY.--MRS. WESTON'S POULTRY-HOUSE WAS ROBBED ONE NIGHT OF ALL HER
TURKEYS--EVIDENTLY BY THE INGENUITY OF MAN. OTHER POULTRY-YARDS IN
THE NEIGHBOURHOOD ALSO SUFFERED.--PILFERING WAS HOUSEBREAKING TO MR.
WOODHOUSE'S FEARS.--HE WAS VERY UNEASY; AND BUT FOR THE SENSE OF HIS
SON-IN-LAW'S PROTECTION, WOULD HAVE BEEN UNDER WRETCHED ALARM EVERY
NIGHT OF HIS LIFE. THE STRENGTH, RESOLUTION, AND PRESENCE OF MIND OF THE
MR. KNIGHTLEYS, COMMANDED HIS FULLEST DEPENDENCE. WHILE EITHER OF THEM
PROTECTED HIM AND HIS, HARTFIELD WAS SAFE.--BUT MR. JOHN KNIGHTLEY MUST
BE IN LONDON AGAIN BY THE END OF THE FIRST WEEK IN NOVEMBER.

THE RESULT OF THIS DISTRESS WAS, THAT, WITH A MUCH MORE VOLUNTARY,
CHEERFUL CONSENT THAN HIS DAUGHTER HAD EVER PRESUMED TO HOPE FOR AT THE
MOMENT, SHE WAS ABLE TO FIX HER WEDDING-DAY--AND MR. ELTON WAS CALLED
ON, WITHIN A MONTH FROM THE MARRIAGE OF MR. AND MRS. ROBERT MARTIN, TO
JOIN THE HANDS OF MR. KNIGHTLEY AND MISS WOODHOUSE.

THE WEDDING WAS VERY MUCH LIKE OTHER WEDDINGS, WHERE THE PARTIES HAVE
NO TASTE FOR FINERY OR PARADE; AND MRS. ELTON, FROM THE PARTICULARS
DETAILED BY HER HUSBAND, THOUGHT IT ALL EXTREMELY SHABBY, AND VERY
INFERIOR TO HER OWN.--"VERY LITTLE WHITE SATIN, VERY FEW LACE VEILS; A
MOST PITIFUL BUSINESS!--SELINA WOULD STARE WHEN SHE HEARD OF IT."--BUT,
IN SPITE OF THESE DEFICIENCIES, THE WISHES, THE HOPES, THE CONFIDENCE,
THE PREDICTIONS OF THE SMALL BAND OF TRUE FRIENDS WHO WITNESSED THE
CEREMONY, WERE FULLY ANSWERED IN THE PERFECT HAPPINESS OF THE UNION.
